      address, and customer number of your account with the App store provider,

      process such data only to the extent necessary for downloading the App to
      your end device (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR

2.3 In the App we will process your "Likes", i.e., brands, stores and offers
      selected by you as preferred, in order to display them to you in the App

      further analysis of these geodata by us. You can allow or deny the App
      access to your geodata at any time in the settings of your operating

      location. You can object to this processing at any time by clicking the opt-out button in the menu "Services > Settings" in the App.

2.3.2 For market research purposes and to tailor our entire services to the needs

The frequency of certain interactions with our App (e.g. Likes, see section 2.3, online purchases and purchases at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN as well as customer benefits, see section 3).
This processing of your personal data serves to obtain a satisfaction rating regarding our App (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR

For further processing of your rating, the respective app store provider independently collects further personal data from you, which you enter into the rating system. The processing of your personal data by the respective app store provider is carried out in accordance with their respective relevant data protection provisions. The data collected by us in accordance with this section will not be transmitted to the respective app store provider at any time.

      provided (e.g., your name and e-mail address) in order to respond to your
      questions (

as far as we are legally 
    permitted to do so without your consent, or otherwise based on your consent (

      code to make it easier for you to use the App for the OUTLETCITY CLUB (
Art.
      6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
). The OUTLETCITY CLUB code is an OUTLETCITY customer
      card for the OUTLETCITY CLUB that will be issued by us in digital form.
      This OUTLETCITY CLUB code will however not be linked to your customer
      account until you register.
2.8 If you redeem the code of a shopping pass in the App, we will process your OUTLETCITY CLUB code as well as the date of redemption and the date and time of activation of the 
      respective shopping pass on the basis of
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
.
3. Personalisation of advertising in connection with your customer account
We classify your master, location and registration data, your interactions with our online services (Website and app, e.g. clicks, search entries, shopping baskets, watch lists, likes), with customer benefits (e.g. coupons, vouchers, discount codes, club), with our e-mail services (e.g. newsletter and e-mail reminder), and also all aspects of your purchases at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN and your online purchases as well as the preferences you have given and your cookie and data protection consent management settings to your customer account, insofar as we are able to do so. This usually takes place with the addition of time information.
We do this in order to be able to present and offer you advertising that is as relevant to you as possible, such as category and product lists, brands, offers, specific products, coupons, vouchers or discount codes as well as restaurants of OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, or to limit our advertising measures towards you or to exclude you from these. Time information is also used to calculate deadlines for the deletion of data.
For these purposes, we use various methods to calculate categorised information, affinity lists and probability values from individual pieces of information, which we store with us in addition to your data record (profile information). The profiles are updated regularly with each new piece of information or in other cases.
We use the calculated profile information to decide which advertising we present to you, how often and via which channels (e.g. our and third-party websites of our advertising partners as data recipients, our e-mail newsletters, our and third-party apps of our advertising partners as data recipients, on-site promotions). The advertising may also be based on product categories, trend affinities, brands, articles, taking into account available sizes, coupons, vouchers, discount codes and the like calculated individually for you, as we calculate corresponding personalised profiles in advance. The advertising measures can be disseminated by us ourselves or by our advertising partners, to whom we send profile information as data recipients for this purpose.
The evaluation can also decide which coupons, vouchers, discount codes we send out. We also use redeemed coupons, vouchers, discount codes to measure the success of any associated advertising campaign we may run with third parties, to determine your preferences and, where relevant, to calculate the amount of any revenue-based compensation claims by our promoters or revenue-based commissions for other intermediaries, as you may also receive such coupons, vouchers, discount codes from time to time from third parties with whom we work.
We also aim to target individual customers, particularly identified TOP customers, and to continue to estimate the overall value of our customer base.
Depending on your place of residence and its proximity to OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, you will receive preferential advertising with offers from OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, omnichannel offers or purely online offers. For this purpose, your place of residence is evaluated at the level of the first digit of the postcode.
3.1 Individual information
In this context, we process your history with us (individual information):
your shopping baskets, purchases and returns to calculate purchase and return rates
information about whether you bought more online or more at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN
information on which brands and categories of goods you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase
information on whether and which offers in the sale you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase
information on whether and which items you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase, as well as how we have described these products
information on whether and which coupons, vouchers or discount codes you use and in what amount, in particular whether you have already activated and/or used a coupon, voucher or discount code (for example a shopping pass) and via which advertising channel you received these
information on which sizes and/or colours you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list, purchase and/or return
information on which payment methods you use
information on which rewards you choose
preference information that you deposit with us yourself
your registrations for e-mail reminders (e.g. for sold-out goods) and what the desired e-mail reminder refers to
time details of your initial registration, your actions on our Website and in the app and your purchases, as well as your age
3.2	Legal basis and legitimate interests
This processing of your personal data is carried out in our legitimate interest (
Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR
) in presenting our customers with the most relevant advertising possible and in running successful advertising campaigns so that we can improve your shopping experience with us and so that you are happy to shop again in the Online Shop or at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN. We also have a legitimate interest in making it easier for you to find the offers you need at the right time, and to remind you of what has interested you on our site by e-mail or on third party platforms. We ourselves have a legitimate interest in ensuring that you reduce expensive occasional purchases that you later become annoyed about and return the goods. We want to avoid unnecessary advertising by providing you with offers that are as relevant to you as possible. In doing so, we want to provide you with targeted advice, but also inspire you with relevant trends so that you stay up to date. Overall, we are pursuing our legitimate interest in optimising the shopping experience so that you can quickly find an overview of the offers that are relevant to you and thus waste less time with searches or irrelevant advertising and offer presentations. It may also happen that our systems conclude that you are not being targeted by advertising from us, so that we then reduce or suspend our advertising measures. For this purpose, we have a legitimate interest in forming corresponding profiles and carrying out personalisation.
3.3 Algorithms
We use both rule-based models and machine learning models for the aforementioned calculations of profile information.
In rule-based models, for example, we count and weight how often you have clicked on a category or added it to your shopping basket, for example, and this is combined with products you have bought, which we also categorise. Purchases are usually weighted much higher than individual clicks. The categories with the highest ratios are categorised as most likely to be relevant to you in the future. Within the framework of rule-based models, we also compare your history with the history of all other customers, for example, and thereby form customer groups.
In machine learning, a software analyses a large amount of historical behavioural and outcome data from all customers and compares this with data about you to infer your likely future preferences according to weightings the software has created itself.
3.4 Storage period
We only store profile information that we have algorithmically calculated for you until the next recalculation of the profile information with us or until your objection, whichever comes first. If no more individual information is available for the calculation, the profile information will be deleted with the subsequent recalculation.
Beyond, we only store the individual information that we only store for the aforementioned purposes and not also for other reasons for as long as this individual information can still have a significance for future behaviour. For example, in the area of OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, data that we categorise according to predefined rules is relevant for up to 900 days after the individual information was created, whereas in the area of online sales, which are usually more frequent, we only use individual information for up to 730 days (2 years) after it was created.
For the storage period for other reasons, please refer to the other parts of this privacy notice.
4. Storage period
We process personal data only as long as this is necessary for the
      aforementioned purposes and erase personal data thereafter or – if we are
      subject to legal retention obligations - restrict the processing of
      personal data.
5. Recipients of Data
5.1 In order to be able to offer the App, we will transfer your personal
      data to our hosting provider. We will also use other service
      providers as data processors to provide certain services through the App and to improve the
      App:
We have entered into data processing agreements with all of them to ensure your personal
      data will be processed strictly according to our instructions.
5.2 We only transfer personal data to third countries to the extent that service providers operate in third countries as processors or under joint control. In the absence of an adequacy decision by the European Commission for the respective third country, this is done with your consent and/or subject to appropriate or adequate safeguards (
Art. 46, 49 GDPR
).
You have the possibility to obtain a copy of the respective safeguards used via the address of the responsible person indicated above.
For U.S.-based companies, the adequacy decision (EU-US Privacy Framework) adopted by the European Commission on July 10, 2023 applies, provided that the respective company is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework.
6. Your Rights
6.1 You have the following rights with respect to your personal data in
      accordance with applicable law:
Right of access;
Right to rectification and erasure;
Right to restricted of processing;
Right to data portability.
6.2 If data processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
, you have the
      right to revoke your consent at any time, in which case the lawfulness of
      data processing carried out on the basis of your consent prior to
      revocation will remain unaffected.
6.3
You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation,
          to object at any time to the processing of your personal data on the
          basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR; this also applies to any profiling
          based on these provisions. We will no longer process personal data
          unless we can show compelling legitimate reasons for continued data
          processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, and
          unless we process data to assert, exercise, or defend legal rights or
          claims. If the purpose of data processing is direct advertising, you
          have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal
          data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to
          profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If you object to the processing, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
6.4 You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
      authority.

We ourselves have a legitimate interest in ensuring that you reduce expensive occasional purchases that you later become annoyed about and return the goods. We want to avoid unnecessary advertising by providing you with offers that are as relevant to you as possible. In doing so, we want to provide you with targeted advice, but also inspire you with relevant trends so that you stay up to date. Overall, we are pursuing our legitimate interest in optimising the shopping experience so that you can quickly find an overview of the offers that are relevant to you and thus waste less time with searches or irrelevant advertising and offer presentations. It may also happen that our systems conclude that you are not being targeted by advertising from us, so that we then reduce or suspend our advertising measures. For this purpose, we have a legitimate interest in forming corresponding profiles and carrying out personalisation.
3.3 Algorithms
We use both rule-based models and machine learning models for the aforementioned calculations of profile information.
In rule-based models, for example, we count and weight how often you have clicked on a category or added it to your shopping basket, for example, and this is combined with products you have bought, which we also categorise. Purchases are usually weighted much higher than individual clicks. The categories with the highest ratios are categorised as most likely to be relevant to you in the future. Within the framework of rule-based models, we also compare your history with the history of all other customers, for example, and thereby form customer groups.
In machine learning, a software analyses a large amount of historical behavioural and outcome data from all customers and compares this with data about you to infer your likely future preferences according to weightings the software has created itself.
3.4 Storage period
We only store profile information that we have algorithmically calculated for you until the next recalculation of the profile information with us or until your objection, whichever comes first. If no more individual information is available for the calculation, the profile information will be deleted with the subsequent recalculation.
Beyond, we only store the individual information that we only store for the aforementioned purposes and not also for other reasons for as long as this individual information can still have a significance for future behaviour. For example, in the area of OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, data that we categorise according to predefined rules is relevant for up to 900 days after the individual information was created, whereas in the area of online sales, which are usually more frequent, we only use individual information for up to 730 days (2 years) after it was created.
For the storage period for other reasons, please refer to the other parts of this privacy notice.
4. Storage period
We process personal data only as long as this is necessary for the
      aforementioned purposes and erase personal data thereafter or – if we are
      subject to legal retention obligations - restrict the processing of
      personal data.
5. Recipients of Data
5.1 In order to be able to offer the App, we will transfer your personal
      data to our hosting provider. We will also use other service
      providers as data processors to provide certain services through the App and to improve the
      App:
We have entered into data processing agreements with all of them to ensure your personal
      data will be processed strictly according to our instructions.
5.2 We only transfer personal data to third countries to the extent that service providers operate in third countries as processors or under joint control. In the absence of an adequacy decision by the European Commission for the respective third country, this is done with your consent and/or subject to appropriate or adequate safeguards (
Art. 46, 49 GDPR
).
You have the possibility to obtain a copy of the respective safeguards used via the address of the responsible person indicated above.
For U.S.-based companies, the adequacy decision (EU-US Privacy Framework) adopted by the European Commission on July 10, 2023 applies, provided that the respective company is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework.
6. Your Rights
6.1 You have the following rights with respect to your personal data in
      accordance with applicable law:
Right of access;
Right to rectification and erasure;
Right to restricted of processing;
Right to data portability.
6.2 If data processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
, you have the
      right to revoke your consent at any time, in which case the lawfulness of
      data processing carried out on the basis of your consent prior to
      revocation will remain unaffected.
6.3
You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation,
          to object at any time to the processing of your personal data on the
          basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR; this also applies to any profiling
          based on these provisions. We will no longer process personal data
          unless we can show compelling legitimate reasons for continued data
          processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, and
          unless we process data to assert, exercise, or defend legal rights or
          claims. If the purpose of data processing is direct advertising, you
          have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal
          data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to
          profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If you object to the processing, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
6.4 You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
      authority.
6.5 You may contact our data protection officer (Section 1.2) to exercise your rights.

A. Overview
To give you an overview of our data processing activities, we present them to you in this overview.
1. Website
When you visit our Website, we store information about you by using log files so we can optimise our online presence in the future and in order
        to ensure data protection control and data security. We also use a so-called content delivery network so that we can reliably provide the
        content of the Website.
If you contact us via our Website or submit a press enquiry, we process your personal data resulting from your enquiry in order to be able to
        answer it to your satisfaction.
For certain forms, we want to ensure that they can only be used by humans and not by software. For this purpose, we use so-called captcha
        services.
2. OUTLETCITY CLUB and Online Shop
The OUTLETCITY CLUB is OUTLETCITY's loyalty programme. In order to be able to offer you the OUTLETCITY CLUB and provide you with the most
        relevant offers possible, we collect personal data from you when you register for and use the OUTLETCITY CLUB. In addition to the data that we
        request as part of the registration process, this also includes data that we assign to your customer account, such as your personal
        identification number, your purchase history or information about how many reward points you have received or, if applicable, redeemed.
The use of our Online Shop is linked to a membership in the OUTLETCITY CLUB. Accordingly, we process the same personal data for both.
Credit agencies help us, with regard to orders, to regularly check address data and in some cases, depending on the selected payment method,
        obtain information as to your credit rating.
In order to be able to offer you the Online Shop and to market our products and services, we cooperate with various data processors and other
        service providers who may also have access to your relevant personal data in this context.
3. Cookies and tracking
We use certain cookies, cookie-like and cookie-based technologies (collectively also "cookies") to improve your user experience and to analyse
        your behaviour. This includes cookies that enable us to use retargeting, fingerprinting, conversion tracking, cross-device tracking or
        customer audiences.
Information on the individual cookies used by us, their functions, purposes, the relevant legal bases, consent options, withdrawal options and
        objection options can be found below (Section C.4) and in the cookie settings at
https://www.outletcity.com/de-de/shop/datenschutzeinstellungen/
.
To capture and process your consent status regarding cookies on our website, we use the Google Consent Mode operated by the provider Google
        Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
The Google Consent Mode works in conjunction with the cookie settings we use on our website. In the Google Consent Mode, your Google tags and
        scripts are adjusted based on your consent status in the cookie settings. Tags are loaded on our website before the consent dialog appears,
        allowing the tag behavior to dynamically adapt depending on the cookie consent you have chosen in the settings. Your consent status is then
        transmitted to Google by the Google Consent Mode for further processing. No personal data is sent to Google.
This processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate interest is to track your consent status in our cookie settings
        and implement your selection accord-ingly on our website.

        Section C.1.

your salutation
your first and last name

your message, including chosen subject line and other personal data that may result from the content of your message
date and time of your enquiry
If you contact us as a non-registered visitor to our Website, we use this personal data to respond to your enquiry. If your enquiry does not
        concern a past, present or potential contractual relationship with us, our processing of your personal data is based on
Art. 6 para. 1
            lit. f GDPR.
. Our legitimate interest is to answer your enquiry.
If you contact us as a member of the OUTLETCITY CLUB (cf. Section C.3) and/or your enquiry relates to a former, current or potential
        contractual relationship with us, our processing of your personal data in order to respond to your enquiry is carried out as part of the
        entering into or performance of this contractual relationship with you and is accordingly based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
Regardless of whether you are a member of the OUTLETCITY CLUB or a non-registered visitor to our Website, we also process your personal data to
        optimise our business processes. This includes in particular the continuous improvement of our handling of enquiries, for which we evaluate
        your enquiry to the extent necessary for this purpose. In this case, our processing of your personal data is based on
Art. 6 para. 1
            lit. f GDPR
and our legitimate interest is to optimise our business processes.

        best possible way:
your salutation
your first and last name

We process this personal data exclusively to respond to your enquiry based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate
        interest is to maintain close press relations.
2. Data processing with regard to mere Website visits
When you visit our Website, whether or not you are a member of the OUTLETCITY CLUB, we process personal data about you as described in this
        Section C.2.
2.1 Log Files
When you access our Website, your browser automatically transmits certain personal data to our servers, for the operation of which we may use
        host providers as data processors. We do this using so-called log files in which your IP address is stored. In addition to the IP address, we
        receive the following personal data from you via the log files:
Referrer URL (i.e. information which website you used before you got to our Website)
date and time of your visit to our Website, time zone difference from GMT
the access method/function desired by the requesting computer
the input details transmitted by the requesting computer (file name)
subpage accessed or name of the requested file
access status/http status code (file transferred, file not found, command not executed, etc.)
transmitted data volume
your browser version and operating system version
This personal data is collected both for the future optimisation of our online services and for data protection control and data security.
If you visit our Website as a member of the OUTLETCITY CLUB or to register as a member, this processing is carried out to initiate or fulfil a
        membership agreement with you and is therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
. Otherwise, this processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate interest is to be able to provide the Website securely and as error-free as
        possible.
2.2 Content Delivery Network
For the delivery of content on our Website, we use a Content Delivery Network ("
CDN
"), which is operated for us by a service
        provider as a processor.
The CDN makes Website content available on various servers around the world so that visitors to our Website can access it as quickly as
        possible from anywhere. The content embedded on our Website, such as images and videos, is obtained from the CDN when the Website is accessed.
        Through this access, information about your use of our Website (such as your IP address) is transmitted to the service provider's servers and
        stored there. This already happens when you simply access the Website with this content.
This processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate interest is to be able to offer a higher level of
        fail-safety, increased protection against data loss and a better loading speed of the Website.
2.3 Captcha services
We use captcha services to ensure that forms on our Website can only be used by humans and not by automated attack software. For this purpose,
        a service provider's captcha tool runs in the background when you want to use certain forms on our Website. This tool analyses your behaviour
        to verify that you are a human. For this analysis, we collect similar personal data via the log files.
Our legitimate interest in processing your personal data through captchas is that we want to protect our Website from spam and attacks by
        automated attack software. The processing is therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
.
3. Data processing in connection with the OUTLETCITY CLUB
If you register for our OUTLETCITY CLUB and then make use of the offer we make available to the OUTLETCITY CLUB members, we also process
        personal data about you.

        purposes described below, we also use your personal data to continuously improve the OUTLETCITY CLUB (

3.1.5 OUTLETCITY CLUB Code and identification number
When you have completed your registration, you will initially only receive your OUTLETCITY CLUB Code. This serves to uniquely identify you as a
        member of the OUTLETCITY CLUB.
Because the OUTLETCITY CLUB Code can change in the course of your membership, for example if you lose your customer card or if you uninstall
        the OUTLETCITY App in the meantime (cf. Section C.3.5), we also use a unique identification number ("Customer ID"). By using this Customer ID
        in the background, we can ensure that reward points and status points (cf. Sections C.3.3.1 and C.3.3.2) are credited to your account and
        reward points can be redeemed even if the OUTLETCITY CLUB Code changes. We generate this Customer ID exclusively by the system and use it in
        all identification processes. If your customer card is lost, this procedure gives us the opportunity to block the corresponding the OUTLETCITY
        CLUB Code so that you can continue to use the OUTLETCITY CLUB without having to register again.
3.2 Online Shop
When you use our Online Shop, we process further personal data in addition to your Master Data. On which occasion and to what extent this

        legal basis for this data processing is
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR

We then store this personal data with us or the service provider acting on our behalf in connection with the processing and dispatch of orders.
        They are stored there together with the following personal data of you, some of which is relevant to the order and some of which is historical
        data, in order to be able to offer you an order history and to store it for the purpose of evaluating and improving customer satisfaction:

        for its fulfilment, for the processing and execution of your individual purchase agreements (

        lists of approved customers ourselves and analyse your return behaviour. We do this to avoid payment defaults based on
Art. 6 para. 1
            lit. f GDPR
. We store the result of our assessment in each case until recalculation. If your name is on a black list, you cannot
        pay us by SEPA direct debit or invoice. If you are on a list of approved customers, you can use all payment methods.
If our own analysis does not lead to a clear result, we will transmit your name, address and, if applicable, your date of birth for checking
        your creditworthiness and credit standing to the relevant credit agencies named in Section C.3.2.1.3. Legal basis for these transfers is
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. The result of the assessment of your cre-ditworthiness is only processed immediately in order to
        be able to display your personal payment method selection and is not stored beyond this.
The respective credit agencies process the data received and use it for profiling (scoring) in order to provide their respective contractual
        partners with information for assessing the creditworthiness of natural persons. You can find more information on their processing of your
        personal data at the respective credit agencies (see above). For questions about and in connection with the determination of your credit score
        by the individual credit agencies, please contact the respective credit agency directly.
3.2.1.4.2 Frictionless Flow
To enhance the user experience, we transmit individual categories of data that identify you (such as your address) and categories of data that
        relate to your order (such as whether you redeem a voucher) to the selected payment service provider.
This allows us, under certain conditions, to save you a time-consuming authentication process in which you have to enter further data on
        additional payment service websites (so-called "
frictionless flow
"). This is based on your interest in being able to make
        your payment without being redirected if possible and our interest in being able to offer you this user-friendly and secure payment process
        (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
).
3.2.1.4.3 Payment
Depending on the payment method you have chosen, we process the requested payment data from you ourselves and forward it to the integrated
        payment service provider if necessary. In some cases, however, we have outsourced the entire payment process so that we do not process any
        further personal data from you ourselves.
This processing of your personal data is carried out for the purpose of processing your purchase agreement for the respective goods ordered and
        is therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
.
3.2.1.5 Sovendus
From time to time, especially after placing an order, we display voucher offers from Sovendus GmbH, Moltkestraße 11, 76133 Karlsruhe
        ("
Sovendus
"). During this process, we transmit your IP address to Sovendus, which uses it exclusively for data security
        purposes and usually anonymises it after seven days. If you click on a voucher banner from Sovendus, we transmit your name and e-mail address
        in encrypted form to Sovendus for the preparation of the voucher.
In addition, we transmit the order number, order value with currency, session ID, voucher code and timestamp to Sovendus in pseudonymised form
        for their redemption of the vouchers.
This processing of your personal data is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate interest is to improve your
        shopping experience in our Online Shop.
For further information on the processing of your personal data by Sovendus, please see their Privacy Notice at
www.sovendus.de/datenschutz
(or for Austria:
www.sovendus.at/datenschutz
and for Switzerland: www.sovendus.ch/datenschutz).
3.2.1.6 Parcel tracking / Shipping to a Packstation or Postal Outlet
In your customer account (MY ACCOUNT), you have the option of retrieving status information on parcel tracking. For this purpose, the data of
        your order, in particular the parcel number, but also your e-mail address are transmitted to our logistics service provider, who handles this
        technically for us, if necessary with the involvement of a shipping service provider, and returns the data on the shipment. This enables you
        to retrieve an order history with information about the status of our shipments to you. Our service provider may also inform you about the
        status of your shipment by e-mail.
If you have selected delivery to a postal outlet or a Packstation during the order pro-cess, we will transmit your Post-number to the shipping
        service provider. Our service provider may also inform you about the delivery of your shipment via email.
This processing of your personal data is carried out for the purpose of processing your purchase agreement for the respective goods ordered and
        is therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
as well as
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate
        interest is to improve your user experience after your order.
3.2.1.7 Returns
Should you exercise your right of withdrawal, exchange goods or assert warranty rights, we will process the following additional personal data:
information about your return (shipping service provider, parcel number, information about the time of shipment)
information about the receipt at our office (location, ID numbers, time)
information on the condition of the goods
type, category, brand and description of the goods
your Customer ID
date of purchase of the goods
We process this personal data to be able to reverse the relevant purchase agreement with you (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
), to
        have evidence of the steps leading to the agreement being reversed, to be able to offer you an order history and to be able to offer you a
        personalised user experience optimised for you (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
). Our legitimate interest here is to preserve
        evidence, increase customer satisfaction, optimise offers and promote sales.
3.2.2 Ordering via the marketplace with our marketplace partners
If you order a product from one of our marketplace partners via our marketplace, we process your personal data to the same extent, for the same
        purposes and based on the same legal bases as described in Section C.3.2.1.
However, for the processing of your order, the dispatch and the processing of possible returns, we use the respective marketplace partner as a
        data processor.
3.2.3 Ordering deliveries to Switzerland
If you order to a Swiss delivery address, we will process your personal data as described in Section C.3.2.1 In deviation from this, however,
        we will transmit the data to logistics and shipping service providers as well as payment service providers in Switzerland if necessary. For
        Switzerland, there is a transfer basis in the form of the EU Commission's adequacy decision.
3.3 Rewards programme
If you are a member of our OUTLETCITY CLUB, you can collect reward points, which you can redeem for rewards when you reach a certain number of
        reward points. Unless another legal basis is explicitly assigned to data processing below, the data processing in this Section C.3.3 is
        carried out in order to conclude or perform your membership agreement for the OUTLETCITY CLUB and is therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1
            lit. b GDPR
.
3.3.1 Reward points
When you collect reward points as part of the OUTLETCITY CLUB, we process the following personal data from you in this context:
information on which reward points you have collected from purchases in our Online Shop and which you have collected from purchases at one
            of the affiliated partner companies in the brick-and-mortar OUTLETCITY ("OUTLETCITY METZINGEN")
for purchases at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, information on which partner you have collected the reward points from
information on the goods purchased, the price and the number of reward points earned for each of them
information on possible returns for purchases in the Online Shop
purchase date
information on whether you receive reward points from a special promotion
3.3.2 Status level
To enable us to manage your status, we process the following necessary personal data:
your turnover for the previous twelve months
information about which status you have at any given time and, if applicable, which status you once had at an earlier point in time.
information about which benefits you have claimed
Depending on your status level, parking on the premises of the OUTLETCITY METZINGEN is at a discount for you. As we need to consider this when
        you are paying for your parking ticket, we process the information about your status level and the parking duration if you identify yourself
        with your OUTLETCITY CLUB Code. In order to process the check whether you are allowed to park at a reduced rate, we use the service providers
        used for the operation of the car parks as data processors.
3.3.3 Initial use without registration
We also allow you to use the OUTLETCITY CLUB at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN on a trial basis without prior registration. In this case, you will
        receive an OUTLETCITY CLUB Code that you can use as a QR code in the OUTLETCITY App or in printed form.
For this purpose, we already store all the personal data mentioned in Section C.3.3.1 without knowing any of your Master Data or assigning the
        stored data to your person.
If you register for the OUTLETCITY CLUB later, we will link the personal data we have stored for your OUTLETCITY CLUB Code with your Master
        Data.
3.3.4 Reward shop
When you redeem reward points, we process the following personal data from you for this purpose:
information on the selected and redeemed rewards
information on the number of redeemed reward points
the delivery address for the reward shipment
The reward dispatch may be carried out directly via the service provider whose goods or services we offer as a reward as our data processor.
        For this purpose, we will pass on your name and the delivery address to the relevant service provider.
3.4 Personalisation of advertising in connection with your customer account
We classify your master, location and registration data, your interactions with our online services (Website and app, e.g. clicks, search
        entries, shopping baskets, watch lists, likes), with customer benefits (e.g. coupons, vouchers, discount codes, club), with our e-mail
        services (e.g. newsletter and e-mail reminder), and also all aspects of your purchases at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN and your online purchases as
        well as the preferences you have given and your cookie and data protection consent management settings to your customer account, insofar as we
        are able to do so. This usually takes place with the addition of time information.
We do this in order to be able to present and offer you advertising that is as relevant to you as possible, such as category and product lists,
        brands, offers, specific products, coupons, vouchers or discount codes as well as restaurants of OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, or to limit our
        advertising measures towards you or to exclude you from these. Time information is also used to calculate deadlines for the deletion of data.
For these purposes, we use various methods to calculate categorised information, affinity lists and probability values from individual pieces
        of information, which we store with us in addition to your data record (profile information). The profiles are updated regularly with each new
        piece of information or in other cases.
We use the calculated profile information to decide which advertising we present to you, how often and via which channels (e.g. our and
        third-party websites of our advertising partners as data recipients, our e-mail newsletters, our and third-party apps of our advertising
        partners as data recipients, on-site promotions). The advertising may also be based on product categories, trend affinities, brands, articles,
        taking into account available sizes, coupons, vouchers, discount codes and the like calculated individually for you, as we calculate
        corresponding personalised profiles in advance. The advertising measures can be disseminated by us ourselves or by our advertising partners,
        to whom we send profile information as data recipients for this purpose.
The evaluation can also decide which coupons, vouchers, discount codes we send out. We also use redeemed coupons, vouchers, discount codes to
        measure the success of any associated advertising campaign we may run with third parties, to determine your preferences and, where relevant,
        to calculate the amount of any revenue-based compensation claims by our promoters or revenue-based commissions for other intermediaries, as
        you may also receive such coupons, vouchers, discount codes from time to time from third parties with whom we work.
We also aim to target individual customers, particularly identified TOP customers, and to continue to estimate the overall value of our
        customer base.
Depending on your place of residence and its proximity to OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, you will receive preferential advertising with offers from
        OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, omnichannel offers or purely online offers. For this purpose, your place of residence is evaluated at the level of the
        first digit of the postcode.
3.4.1 Individual information
In this context, we process your history with us (individual information):
your shopping baskets, purchases and returns to calculate purchase and return rates
information about whether you bought more online or more at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN
information on which brands and categories of goods you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase
information on whether and which offers in the sale you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase
information on whether and which items you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list and purchase, as well as how
            we have described these products
information on whether and which coupons, vouchers or discount codes you use and in what amount, in particular whether you have already
            activated and/or used a coupon, voucher or discount code (for example a shopping pass) and via which advertising channel you received
            these
information on which sizes and/or colours you view, search, add to the shopping basket, place on the watch list, purchase and/or return
information on which payment methods you use
information on which rewards you choose
preference information that you deposit with us yourself
your registrations for e-mail reminders (e.g. for sold-out goods) and what the desired e-mail reminder refers to
time details of your initial registration, your actions on our Website and in the app and your purchases, as well as your age
3.4.2 Lega basis and legitimate interests
This processing of your personal data is carried out in our legitimate interest (
Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR
) in presenting our
        customers with the most relevant advertising possible and in running successful advertising campaigns so that we can improve your shopping
        experience with us and so that you are happy to shop again in the Online Shop or at OUTLETCITY METZINGEN. We also have a legitimate interest
        in making it easier for you to find the offers you need at the right time, and to remind you of what has interested you on our site by e-mail
        or on third party platforms. We ourselves have a legitimate interest in ensuring that you reduce expensive occasional purchases that you later
        become annoyed about and return the goods. We want to avoid unnecessary advertising by providing you with offers that are as relevant to you
        as possible. In doing so, we want to provide you with targeted advice, but also inspire you with relevant trends so that you stay up to date.
        Overall, we are pursuing our legitimate interest in optimising the shopping experience so that you can quickly find an overview of the offers
        that are relevant to you and thus waste less time with searches or irrelevant advertising and offer presentations. It may also happen that our
        systems conclude that you are not being targeted by advertising from us, so that we then reduce or suspend our advertising measures. For this
        purpose, we have a legitimate interest in forming corresponding profiles and carrying out personalisation.
3.4.3 Algorithms
We use both rule-based models and machine learning models for the aforementioned calculations of profile information.
In rule-based models, for example, we count and weight how often you have clicked on a category or added it to your shopping basket, for
        example, and this is combined with products you have bought, which we also categorise. Purchases are usually weighted much higher than
        individual clicks. The categories with the highest ratios are categorised as most likely to be relevant to you in the future. Within the
        framework of rule-based models, we also compare your history with the history of all other cus-tomers, for example, and thereby form customer
        groups.
In machine learning, a software analyses a large amount of historical behavioural and outcome data from all customers and compares this with
        data about you to infer your likely future preferences according to weightings the software has created itself.
3.4.4 Storage periods
We only store profile information that we have algorithmically calculated for you until the next recalculation of the profile information with
        us or until your objection, whichever comes first. If no more individual information is available for the calculation, the profile information
        will be deleted with the subsequent recalculation.
Beyond, we only store the individual information that we only store for the aforementioned purposes and not also for other reasons for as long
        as this individual information can still have a significance for future behaviour. For example, in the area of OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, data that
        we categorise according to predefined rules is relevant for up to 900 days after the individual information was created, whereas in the area
        of online sales, which are usually more frequent, we only use individual information for up to 730 days (2 years) after it was created.
For the storage period for other reasons, please refer to the other parts of this privacy notice.
3.5 Using the OUTLETCITY App
Information on the processing of your personal data in the OUTLETCITY App ("
OUTLETCITY App
") can be found at
https://www.outletcity.com/en/metzingen/app-data-protection/
.
3.6 Newsletter
You will receive our newsletter either as part of your membership of the OUTLETCITY CLUB (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b
            GDPR
) or because you have given us explicit consent to do so (
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
).
3.6.1 Dispatch
In order to send our newsletter, we process the following personal data from you:
your salutation
your e-mail address
In deciding which newsletters and how often to send them to you, we also take into account the personal data described in Section C.3.4, as
        well as the personal data result-ing from Section C.3.6.2 below.
3.6.2 Evaluation
We evaluate your behaviour in connection with the newsletter. For this evaluation, the newsletters sent contain so-called web beacons or
        tracking pixels. These are single-pixel image files that are stored on our Website. For the evaluations, we link your personal data and the
        web beacons with your e-mail address and an individual ID. Links contained in the newsletter also contain this ID. With the data obtained in
        this way, we create a profile to tailor the newsletter to your individual interests. In doing so, we record when you read our newsletter,
        which links you click on in it and deduce your personal interests from this. We link this data to actions you have taken on our Website. This
        processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
and is carried out in our legitimate interest to provide you
        with a better shopping experience.
3.6.3 A/B tests
In order to optimally design the user experience for all members of the OUTLETCITY CLUB and to be able to continuously improve our services, we
        conduct A/B tests in which we send different newsletters to different comparison groups and compare the conversion rate achieved in each case
        with that of the other comparison group. This processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
and is carried
        out in our legitimate interest to provide you with a better shopping experience and to use our advertising as profitably as possible for all
        parties involved.
3.7 Surveys
In our Online Shop and our e-mail newsletters, you will find the option to participate in surveys, for which we use a service provider as a
        data processor. If you participate in a survey, we process the following personal data from you in order to carry out the survey:
if applicable, your customer number; if we carry out the survey in a personalised manner, we will point this out to you in each individual
            case
your IP address
your device, browser type and operating system
date and time of participation in the survey
the information you provided in the survey
information about whether you have answered the questions completely
However, we do not evaluate the surveys on a personal basis, but only using to pseudonymised customer segment information and other anonymous
        criteria.
This data processing is based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
. Our legitimate interest is to enable the
        continuous improvement of our range of products and services.
3.8 Mail
If we send you mail for information about OUTLETCITY METZINGEN, the OUTLETCITY CLUB and the Online Shop based on your data, we will process the
        following personal data from you for this purpose:
salutation
first and last name
address
We also take into account the personal data described in Section C.3.4 in deciding which and how often to send you informative mail.
This data processing takes place either in the context of the performance of our membership agreement for the OUTLETCITY CLUB with you and is
        therefore based on
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR
. If you are not a member of our OUTLETCITY CLUB, we process your personal data
        mentioned in this Section in our interest in dispatching sales-promoting advertising on the basis of
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
            GDPR
.
4. Cookies and tracking
We use numerous cookies and cookie-like or cookie-based technologies on our Website for various purposes, including tracking purposes.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by the browser. Cookies do not cause any damage there. They serve, for
        example, to make our offer to you more user-friendly, effective and secure.
Cookies are processed on our Website for the following general purposes and on the following legal basis:
session cookies, which are used in particular for the functioning of customer accounts or the shopping basket function (
§ 25 para. 2
                TDDDG
in conjunction with the legal basis stated in the cookie settings)
web analytics cookies used to analyse your usage behaviour on our Website (
§ 25 para. 2 TDDDG
in conjunction with the legal basis
            stated in the cookie settings)
advertising cookies that we set in order to be able to work with advertising partners (
§ 25 para. 2 TDDDG
in conjunction with the
            legal basis stated in the cookie settings)
We only use certain cookie-based or cookie-like technologies in the area of our Online Shop that is only accessible to members of our
        OUTLETCITY CLUB, while we set other cookies for all visitors to our Website. The use of cookie-based or cookie-like technologies to process
        your personal data is carried out using various service providers as order processors or under joint control.
Insofar as the aforementioned data processing is carried out under joint control, our service providers will also use the collected data in
        whole or in part for their own business purposes, as regularly described in the product and data protection publications of the service
        providers. This may be based on a user relationship (
Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b DSGVO
), on consent (
Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1
            lit. a DSGVO
) or on legitimate interests of the service providers (
Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO
).
In each of these cases, we have concluded a joint controller agreement to determine compliance with the obligations under the GDPR with regard
        to joint control. We will be happy to provide this to you upon request.
Insofar as we pursue a self-interest in the data processing in joint control with our service providers, e.g. because the data processing
        serves conversion tracking, retargeting or the display of relevant advertising, data subjects should see us as the point of contact for rights
        under Art. 15-20 GDPR. With regard to data processing for the service provider's own business purposes, data subjects should contact the
        service provider directly, as named at
https://www.outletcity.com/de-de/shop/datenschutzeinstellungen/
.
        There is no obligation for the data subject to contact the service provider.
Information on the individual cookies used by us, their functions and purposes, the relevant legal bases, consent, revocation and objection
        options as well as information on processing for own purposes by joint controllers (personal data concerned, purposes, duration of storage as
        well as further information in accordance with Art. 13 DSGVO) can be found in the cookie settings at
https://www.outletcity.com/de-de/shop/datenschutzeinstellungen/
or in the documents linked there.
To help you understand the purposes for which we use the cookies mentioned there better, we describe individual cookie-based or cookie-like
        processing activities in more detail below.
4.1 Movement on the Website and adjustment of the display of advertisements
To help us understand which sub-pages and category pages, or which areas of a sub-page, are particularly relevant to our customers, we analyse
        movements on our Website, as described below. We also use tools that allow us to show you goods that are actually of interest to you.
4.1.1 Evaluation of the use of sub and category pages, heat maps
When you view our Website, we collect the following personal data from you using cookies:
your movements in the Online Shop (i.e. which sub/category page you are on, which sub/category page you came from, how long you stay
            there, what you click on)
information about whether you buy something or not
information from your web browser, in particular HTTP header information such as user agent, IP address, country, language and information
            about the web browser used as well as information about the website previously visited
In addition, we use the web analysis tool of a service provider on our Website, to record randomly selected individual visits to the Website.
        This creates a log of mouse movements, clicks and keyboard interactions, with the intention of randomly reproducing individual Website visits
        as so-called session replays and evaluating them in the form of heat maps. When tracking is used, cookies are stored locally.
4.1.2 Display of relevant advertising
We want to make you individual offers and only show you advertising that is relevant to you, both on our Website and on the websites and apps
        of third parties. The offers can also be contextual based on the content of the website or app you visit. Accordingly, we use cookies to
        record on a personal basis in areas of our Online Shop that you reach after logging in, which areas you have visited, which items you have
        clicked on, placed in the shopping basket and ordered. For this purpose, a cookie-based analysis of previous and current click and purchase
        behaviour may also be carried out. In these cases, a cookie is stored on your computer or mobile device in order to collect pseudonymised data
        about your interests and thus adapt the advertising individually to the stored information. As a result, you will be shown advertising that is
        most likely to match your product and information interests.
Subject to your consent to the use of the respective cookies required for this purpose, we use various service providers and providers of
        affiliate networks for these purposes. In order to be able to assign advertising successes to specific service providers with whom we work, we
        also use a so-called cookie switch. This is provided by a service provider that we use as a data processor.
At
https://www.outletcity.com/de-de/shop/datenschutzeinstellungen/
you can see which service providers these are in each case and decide for yourself which cookies we may set for advertising purposes.
4.1.2.1 Retargeting
If you visit other websites after visiting our Online Shop, we will display advertisements there as a reminder for products that you have
        viewed on our Website (retargeting). The display of these advertisements on third-party websites is based on cookie technology and an analysis
        of previous usage behaviour. We do not learn about your browser's communication with the servers of the retargeting providers. When you visit
        our Online Shop and other websites, your browser communicates directly with the servers of the retargeting providers. The retargeting
        providers therefore receive your IP address, the cookie stored on your computer and what you have looked at while visiting our Online Shop.
        The retargeting provider receives your IP address and the cookie stored with you again when you visit other websites that cooperate with the
        same retargeting provider. Our advertising can then be displayed there on our behalf, for example advertising for the products that you have
        viewed on our Website.
4.1.2.2 Fingerprinting and cross-device-tracking
We also use fingerprinting and cross-device tracking technologies in order to be able to show you advertising that is tailored to your needs
        across all devices. The use of such tracking methods results in the local storage of cookies. In the case of cross-device tracking, a
        cross-device token can be assigned to your stored login and stored locally and temporarily in encrypted form in a cookie on your computer if
        you log in successfully to our Website. Complete IP addresses are not stored in the procedure and are only processed in anonymised form. To
        improve tracking accuracy, we use the "first party tracking" method. In this process, a first-party cookie is set on the customer domain.
        Complete IP addresses are also not stored in this procedure and are only processed in anonymised form.
4.2 Customer Audiences
In addition, we use the personal data we have from you and other customers to create and use so-called Custom Audiences. A Custom Audience is a
        target group that we determine from our customer base by specifying certain criteria to which certain advertisements are to be played. In this
        way, we want to ensure that we only display advertising to you that matches your interests. In order for us to be able to use such
        technologies, we obtain your consent to the use of the relevant cookies in advance.
In this respect, only hashed e-mail addresses and the cookie ID are generally passed on, unless otherwise shown in the cookie settings. With
        regard to this personal data, the explanations on processing (data processed and purposes) and the legal basis under C. 3.1 and 3.4 apply
        together with the explanations under this C. 4.2 and the further information in the cookie settings at

4.3 Conversion tracking
We also use conversion tracking technologies on our Website. If you have seen an advertisement from us and later visit certain target pages of
        our Online Shop, we would like to be able to evaluate this as the success of our advertisement and/or advertising campaign. For this purpose,
        the respective service provider with whom we work for conversion tracking compares information about the advertisements with information about
        which pages you have visited on our Website. We later receive statistical information from the service provider about the success of our
        advertisements, without it being possible for us to identify the specific person for whom the success of our advertisements occurred later.
The service providers used are able to measure the success of the advertisements across devices, so that, for example, an advertisement on a
        smartphone can be attributed to a subsequent purchase on our Website by means of a laptop.

        countries. In the absence of an adequacy decision by the European Commission for the respective third country, this is done with your consent
        and/or subject to appropriate or adequate safeguards (
Art. 46, 49 GDPR
). You can obtain a copy of the respective guarantees used via
        the address of the controller given above. For U.S.-based companies, the adequacy decision (EU-US Privacy Framework) adopt-ed by the European
        Commission on July 10, 2023 applies, provided that the respective company is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework.

We store your personal data until the processing purposes stated in each case have been achieved. Beyond this, we only retain them if and
        insofar as a longer storage obligation or a right to longer storage arises from commercial, tax or other legal requirements.
