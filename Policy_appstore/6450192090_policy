Introduction
MCAI Software Solutions developed the Ai2Query app as a Freemium app. This
      app specializes in converting natural language into SQL queries. We
      recognize the critical importance of privacy, and this policy aims to
      delineate how we manage, secure, and utilize the data processed by our
      application.
Purpose
This Data Privacy Policy outlines our unyielding commitment to protect
      your data while providing our service.
What Data Do We Collect?
No Personal Data Collected
No personal data is collected. All entered data, including connection
      credentials and prompts history, are stored locally on your mobile device.
How Do We Use Data?
Natural Language to SQL Conversion via OpenAI API
The natural language queries are transmitted to the OpenAI API for
      conversion into SQL code. According to OpenAI API's data privacy policy,
      these prompts are retained for 30 days and are not used for the training
      of their AI models. For more information, check out
OpenAI's API Data Privacy
page.
Security Measures
Encryption and Local Storage
All data transmitted to the OpenAI API is encrypted using HTTPS.
      Additionally, all data is stored locally on your mobile device, leveraging
      your device's built-in encryption and security systems.
