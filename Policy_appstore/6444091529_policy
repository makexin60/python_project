We also permit third parties to use tracking technologies on our websites and mobile applications for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences).

Recognition of this signal will only take place with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal. You can opt-out of certain of these tracking technologies by following the instructions in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below. Please note, some features of our websites may not be available to you as a result.

We use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use. Making personal information (such as online/device identifiers, browsing activity, or geolocation) available to these third parties via our use of online tracking technologies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under applicable law. Visitors to our U.S. website can opt out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link at the bottom of our website and selecting their preferences under the header titled “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” It may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information under applicable law when we disclose your email address to the sports leagues we partner with.

To opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as just described, please click the “Your Privacy Choices” or “Cookie Preferences” links at the bottom of our website.

If you are located in the State of California in the United States, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.
In any circumstances, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person, such as your email address; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
