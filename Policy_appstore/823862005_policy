How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.

Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Settings
app on your device.
Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

.
What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

Exporting, removing & deleting your information
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Inactive Account Manager
allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.
And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.

A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Privacy Policy
English
Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
for Apple or
shazam.com/privacy
for Shazam.
To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or by calling 1-800-275-2273.
For more information on exercising your rights, visit
support.apple.com/102283
.
At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to
collect only the personal data that we need
. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
When you create an Apple Account, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:

Device Information.
Data from which your device could be identified, such as device serial number, or about your device, such as browser type
Contact Information
. Data such as name, email address, physical address, phone number, or other contact information
Payment Information. Data about your billing address and method of payment, such as bank details, credit, debit, or other payment card information
Transaction Information.
Data about purchases of Apple products and services or transactions facilitated by Apple, including purchases on Apple platforms
Fraud Prevention Information.
Data used to help identify and prevent fraud, including a device trust score
Usage Data.
Data about your activity on and use of our offerings, such as app launches within our services, including browsing history; search history; product interaction; crash data, performance and other diagnostic data; and other usage data
Location Information
. Precise location only to support services such as Find My or where you agree for region-specific services, and coarse location
Health Information.
Data relating to the health status of an individual, including data related to one’s physical or mental health or condition. Personal health data also includes data that can be used to make inferences about or detect the health status of an individual. If you participate in a study using an Apple Health Research Study app, the policy governing the privacy of your personal data is described in the
Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
.
Fitness Information.
Details relating to your fitness and exercise information where you choose to share them
Financial Information.
Details including salary, income, and assets information where collected, and information related to Apple-branded financial offerings
Government ID Data.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government-issued ID in limited circumstances, including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law
Other Information You Provide to Us.
Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels
You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.
Apple may receive personal data about you from other
individuals
, from businesses or third parties acting
at your direction
, from our
partners
who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other
lawful sources.
Individuals.
Apple may collect data about you from other individuals — for example, if that individual has sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.
At Your Direction.
You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases.
Apple Partners.
We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the
Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form
. For more information about Applebot, visit
support.apple.com/120320
.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Power Our Services.
Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.
Process Your Transactions.
To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it’s also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
child’s educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
“cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

Apple’s international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by

Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.
You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with Apple’s response — refer your complaint to the applicable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.
When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “AppLovin”) operates a suite of tools for app developers and other businesses to automate and optimize the marketing and monetization of their platforms, products, or services by enabling the placement of different types of advertisements on digital properties including mobile apps, websites, and connected TV devices (collectively, the “Advertising Services” or “Services”).  As explained below, consumers interact with us in a few ways, primarily through advertisements served by AppLovin on behalf of advertisers.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our Services and advertising platform, and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (the “Website”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Our Advertising Services
This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Advertising Services.
General Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer who downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services through advertisements served within a digital property, we may collect certain information, including the following:
Device, App, and Browser Data
Device make, model, and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size, orientation, audio, battery, device memory usage, settings, and boot time;
Device settings related to accessibility features, font size, and theme;
Carrier;
Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);
Network connection type and speed;
IP Address;
Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services;
HTTP header information;
Advertising IDs (IDFA/GAID/Amazon FOSAID);
Vendor IDs (IDFV);
App Set IDs; and
Advertising and tracking preferences and restrictions.
Application publishers may choose to share with us additional information including your age or year of birth, gender, email, phone number, and interest segments for purposes of their own direct ad serving.  We do not retain this data or pass it downstream to advertising partners.  Please see the applicable publisher’s privacy policy for more information about their use of first party data.
Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and
Information regarding user interactions with advertising partners and their merchant partners’ sites and advertisements.
How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information
We generally use the information we collect to:
Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here
, current as of the date listed at the top of that page.
If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, please see the
“Manage Your Privacy Choices”
section below. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or Switzerland, you may also see the
“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.
Manage Your Privacy Choices:
To limit collection of information from mobile devices, please visit your device’s settings to set the “Limit Ad Track” or other similar features on your device. Additionally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising within ads served by AppLovin. For detailed instructions, see

. You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting an industry consumer choice platform such as the NAI (
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
) or DAA (
https://optout.aboutads.info/
).  You may still receive ads after limiting processing of information for interest-based advertising, but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.

Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or serve advertisements to, children as defined and required by applicable laws. If you believe we have served an advertisement to a child or might have any personal information from or about a child, or if you believe a mobile application in which an AppLovin-served advertisement appeared may be designed for, directed to, or pass personal information knowingly from, children in violation of our policies, please contact us via email at
dataprotection@applovin.com
.
Data Security and Retention
We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years. Information is automatically purged from our system if the Services do not receive any updated information for a device in the last 2 years.

Data Privacy Framework
AppLovin complies with the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

dataprotection@applovin.com

On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed.

Publisher shall pay all applicable fees, taxes, commissions, transaction fees or the like in connection with such payment.
Mobfox may, at Mobfox’s sole discretion, apply an estimated number of payouts if: (i) the Publisher is referring visitors to Advertiser as verified by clicks through links to Advertiser with Mobfox’s Report, (ii) in the case of an error in Advertiser’s transmission of the Report data to Mobfox, and (iii) in an instance in which Mobfox is able to utilize a historical analysis of the Publisher promotion of Advertiser in order to determine an equitable number of estimated payouts.
If Publisher does not earn the minimum amount in a month, the balance will be carried forward until such time as the minimum amount is earned or until this Agreement is terminated. The Publisher acknowledges that the minimum amount may vary based upon the applicable currency being used and that the binding minimum amount will be the amount listed in Mobfox’s system as may be updated from time to time.

Publisher shall pay all applicable fees, taxes, commissions, transaction fees or the like in connection with such payment.

Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.

AppLovin made it easy to migrate to MAX and we saw immediate improvements by switching, including a 30% ARPDAU lift on iOS. We were surprised to achieve this much of an improvement without additional optimizations. And even after, the AppLovin team continued to help us with additional tools, integrations, and testing, which drove our total revenue even higher.

1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
“), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
3. VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as
“http://vungle.com”

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that use or access the Vungle Services or Vungle Ad Services. In addition, ads within the Vungle Platform may contain links to third-party websites and apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or apps is not governed by this Notice, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.
4.6 How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. Specific measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.
4.7 Data Retention.
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you are an End User, we typically store the personal information we collect about you, such as your IP address and other information described above, for 13 months from the date of last collection before we delete, overwrite, or anonymize that data, unless we are required to keep it to comply with a legal or audit obligation.
Please contact us at privacy@vungle.com if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the information we collect.
4.8 International Data Transfers.
The Vungle Ad Services and Vungle Websites are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States. If you are using the Vungle Ad Services and Vungle Websites from outside the United States, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by Vungle in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, in the United States and other locations including London, Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and Singapore, where we have offices. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request. .
4.9 EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Notice.

If you have an active, duly executed contract for Quantcast services (“
Existing Contract
”), the Existing Contract will govern your use of the service(s) covered in the Existing Contract instead of these Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (“
Terms
”). In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the “
Service
” as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service.
Quantcast Measure Terms of Service
This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this
“Agreement”
)
describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the
“Services”
)
available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
This Agreement incorporates the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the
Privacy Implementation for
Quantcast Publisher Partners
.
1. Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call,
“
Reachpoints
”)
for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call,
“
Measurement Data
”
). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the
“
Measurement Results
”,
which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“Authorized Affiliate”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
2. Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions
provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
3. Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
4. Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual’s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web
pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and
(iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the
“
Ad Preference Setting
”
). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement.
Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
You represent and warrant that you are not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and you do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.
5. Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
6. Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (
“
Quantcast Property
”
). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly
display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
7. Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
8. Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
9. Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing
contact@quantcast.com
(if you are resident in the US) or
contact.dublin@quantcast.com
(if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for
termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
10. Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.
11. Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
12. Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.
This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.
This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

“Agreement”
)

“Services”
)
available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
This Agreement incorporates the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the
Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners
.
1.     Introducti
on: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call,
“
Reachpoints
”)
for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call,
“
Measurement Data
”
). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the
“
Measurement Results
”,
which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“Authorized Affiliate”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
2.     Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
3.     Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
4.     Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual’s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the
“
Ad Preference Setting
”
). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
5.     Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
6.     Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (
“
Quantcast Property
”
). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
7.     Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
8.     Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
9.     Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing contact@quantcast.com (if you are resident in the US) or contact.dublin@quantcast.com (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
10.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.
11.     Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
12.     Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.
This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing contact@quantcast.com (if you are resident in the US) or contact.dublin@quantcast.com (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.
This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.
This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

) describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure and Q for Publishers (the
“Services”
) available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, “
Reachpoints
”) for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, “
Measurement Data
”). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the “
Measurement Results
”, which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3). For more information about how the Services work, please see our
FAQ
.
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“
Authorized Affiliate
”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Data when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users in the EU, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(such as
Quantcast Choice
) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the “
Ad Preference Setting
”). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of processing of any Personal Data disclosed or received under this Agreement.
To the extent that CCPA applies, Quantcast is a Third Party in its relationship with you regarding your use of the Services.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Service to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (“
Quantcast Property
”). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing
contact@quantcast.com
(if you are resident in the US) or
contact.dublin@quantcast.com
(if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
Miscellaneous.

If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable.

Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, “
Reachpoints
”) for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, “
Measurement Data
”). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the “
Measurement Results
”, which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3). For more information about how the Services work, please see our
FAQ
.
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“
Authorized Affiliate
”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Data when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users in the EU, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(such as
Quantcast Choice
) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the “
Ad Preference Setting
”). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of processing of any Personal Data disclosed or received under this Agreement.
To the extent that CCPA applies, Quantcast is a Third Party in its relationship with you regarding your use of the Services.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Service to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (“
Quantcast Property
”). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing
contact@quantcast.com
(if you are resident in the US) or
contact.dublin@quantcast.com
(if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.
This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.
This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

Advertising Exchange
See
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
.
Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more
Pseudonymous Identifier
s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Email Address
See Hashed Email Address
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
Hashed Email Address
A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes
Device Information
.
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Email Address
See Hashed Email Address
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
Hashed Email Address
A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics.  Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
.  An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and Inferred Data to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
on behalf of the Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store  a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com

Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device  or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives Bid Requests from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of Personal Information, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided  to a user; (B) whether  or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s Processing and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s Processing and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you.  For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel.  Other Inferences  include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with Pseudonymous Identifiers to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and Inferences/Inferred Data.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as Pseudonymous Identifiers,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or Inferences/Inferred Data, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as Personal Information. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to Pseudonymised Identifiers. Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a Pseudonymous Identifier which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as IP Addresses) with Bid Request Data and/or Event Data using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using Cookie IDs, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon Personal Information or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by Clients or Third Party Data Partners. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
, Inferences, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a Label (in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers,  where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used  for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These Inferences are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics.  Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
.  An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
on behalf of the Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store  a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device  or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided  to a user; (B) whether  or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you.  For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel.  Other Inferences  include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers,  where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used  for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
, Bid Request Data,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right

Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“
First Party Cookie
”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “
Device IDs
”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “
MAID
”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device by the mobile device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “
TCF Signal
”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“
CMP
”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“
API
”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“
Internet Protocol
”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners is for Quantcast publisher partners and clients (“publishers”) who include Quantcast code, such as pixels or tags, on their websites for Quantcast Measure or the Quantcast QID Module in Prebid. It documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for publishers, which are in addition to the
US Data Privacy Addendum
(the “DPA”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPA, the DPA is the controlling document.
Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.
Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.
This document does not contain legal advice, and adherence to this document does not ensure legal compliance. Publishers must ensure for themselves that they operate in a legal manner, based on their particular circumstances. In the event of any conflict between this document and applicable laws or regulations, the laws or regulations should prevail.
Terminology
This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.
When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.
We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Industry standards and self-regulatory programs
Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Publishers are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.
Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.
Unfortunately, terms used across jurisdictions that describe the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data.
Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a “controller” of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels dropped on your sites. This document, together with the Quantcast agreement under which you access our services, addresses our respective GDPR compliance responsibilities. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party” unless agreed otherwise.
Notice/Transparency and Choice
Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.
When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, including Quantcast Measure tags and the QID prebid module, publishers are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, publishers have to make sure of notice and choice for their own collection and processing of personal data.
At minimum, and further subject to any other applicable laws or rules, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising and advertising measurement), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice, and a link to Quantcast’s
privacy policy
be included.
Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching, and cross-device matching (using passively collected data). The data Quantcast collects includes information about users’ visits to sites, such as IP address, device information, timestamp, referrer URL, etc.
Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods, and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.
For their part, publishers need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Publishers should, at minimum, and subject to any additional legal requirements provide a link to the geographically relevant industry opt-out page, including but not limited to
YourAdChoices
and the
NAI
in the US,
Your Online Choices
in Europe, and
Your Ad Choices
in Canada.
In all cases, publishers should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.
Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.
Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, publishers are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained. Publishers must not send to Quantcast, or enable Quantcast to collect, personal data without having established required permissions, and certainly not if the user has explicitly opted out.
EU and the UK
: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the publisher has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such publishers may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these TCF requirements.
Publishers not using the TCF for EU or UK users may, only with Quantcast’s express written permission, use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF. In any case, publishers should not allow data to be collected by, or transmitted to, Quantcast on their sites without user consent, and must be able to provide proof of consent to Quantcast, upon request.
Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.
US
: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.
California
: The CCPA applies for users in California. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. Unless agreed otherwise with Quantcast, Quantcast acts as a “third-party,” as defined under the CCPA, with respect to personal data it collects or receives from publishers’ sites. Quantcast will check the US Privacy String,
as specified by the IAB
.
Other US states:
Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and elsewhere. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
US State Privacy Addendum
: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US Data Privacy Addendum,
which is available here
.
Access and Deletion
Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, when acting as a controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for honoring users’ access and deletion requests with respect to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services.
Other Matters
Sensitive data
. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category data” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, publishers must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.
Directly identifying personal data
. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and publishers may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Reidentification
. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
and the
International Data Privacy Addendum
(collectively, the “DPAs”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.
Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.
Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.
Terminology
This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.
When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.
We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Industry standards and self-regulatory programs
Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self- regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.
Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc
.
Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.

Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.
Terminology
This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.
When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.
We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Industry standards and self-regulatory programs
Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.
Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.
Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.
Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”
Notice/Transparency and Choice
Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.
When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast’s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.
Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast’s
privacy policy
be included.
Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).
Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.
For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.
In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.
Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.
Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained.
EU and the UK:
The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these requirements.
Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.
Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.
US
: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.
California
: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
Other US states
: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
US State Privacy Addendum:
The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum,
which is available here
.
Access and Deletion
Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.
Other Matters
Sensitive data
. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.
Directly identifying personal data
. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Reidentification
. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

Viewability

a.
Makegood
. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.

Conditions

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the
Information Collection
section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

You can contact us at privacy[at]quantcast[dot]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Clients for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.
To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights

Quantcast Privacy Choices
page.
Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the
Information Collection
section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the
Information use and legal basis
section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

As described in the
Who we are and what we do

The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.
We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:

a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.
Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “Legitimate Interests” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

International transfers
See
Key Terms
for definitions of capitalized terms.
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy[at]quantcast[dot]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information

International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your
Personal Information
may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your
Personal Information
internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your
Personal Information
to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for
Personal Information
. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for
Personal Information
that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection.  You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of
Personal Information
or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Processing
of your
Personal Information
is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject or for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights

Quantcast Privacy Choices

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Personal Information
relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Personal Information
collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of
Personal Information
in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click

.
Any third parties’ handling of
Personal Information,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.
We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the
Key Terms
.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated

Capitalised terms used in this Products and Services Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) are defined in
Key Terms

To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights

Quantcast Privacy Choices

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Personal Information
relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Personal Information
collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of
Personal Information
in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click

Any third parties’ handling of
Personal Information,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.

Key Terms

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the

.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of

for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:

International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your
Personal Information
may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your
Personal Information
internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your
Personal Information
to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for
Personal Information
. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for
Personal Information
that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection.  You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of
Personal Information
or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found below.

page.
Right to object (legitimate interests): The right to object to the
Processing
of your

where we
Process
it on the basis of our legitimate interests, as described in the “

Processing
your
Personal Information
when you object.  To exercise this right, see our

Processing
of your
Personal Information
is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject or for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“
we
”, “
our
”, or “
us
”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “
Clients
”) understand and grow their audiences (the “
Solutions
”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites or mobile apps, that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the Transparency and Consent Framework (“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of Personal Information for the Solutions only. This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Quantcast’s privacy management products, which include our TCF consent management platform (“CMP”), Quantcast Choice. For more information about Quantcast Choice, please click here.
Personal Information collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of Personal Information in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click

.
Any third parties’ handling of Personal Information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.
We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the

Information use and legal basis
As described in the “
Who we are and what we do
” section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.

We also create and share with our Clients insights or reports regarding the makeup of the Audiences that visit their digital properties or the performance of their advertising campaigns. These insights and reports may contain aggregated data from which individual users cannot be uniquely identified or data from which Quantcast has removed Pseudonymous Identifiers.
Information security
We employ appropriate organisational and technical security safeguards designed to keep Personal Information secure when it is transmitted to us and once we receive it. These measures may include encryption and employment of information storage security technologies to restrict access to our network. However, please be aware that no method of transmitting information over the internet or storing information is completely secure.
Information retention
We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in the “
Information Collection
” section above, except where we are required to retain the information for a longer period of time. Once Personal Information has reached its retention period, as applicable, we may either de-identify it (for CCPA purposes), anonymise it (for GDPR purposes) or permanently delete it.
International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.
Additional disclosures for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.
6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

Data Issues
7.1. Data Definitions
:
7.1.1. “
Aggregated Data

7.1.2. “
Campaign Data
” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.
7.1.3. “
Campaign Tag
” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).
7.1.4. “
Company Data
” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).
Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company

.
If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

7.5.
Models
: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company’s Campaigns with other customers.
7.6.
Client Data
: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client’s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “
Client Data
” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

(b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, “
Prohibited Data

8.3. Company represents and warrants that it is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and does not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.

9.
Third-Party Services

Third-Party Service
”), the following additional terms apply.
9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.
9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).
10.
Marketing, Publicity
Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement.
11.
Confidentiality
“
Confidential Information
” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.
12.
Indemnity
12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.
12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company.

13.

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure or termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other sections that by their nature would be presumed to, will survive account closure or termination.
13.2. Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms.

The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited).

The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited).   For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients.

At AWS, customer trust is our top priority.
Maintaining customer trust is an ongoing commitment.

We strive to inform you of the privacy and data security policies, practices, and technologies we’ve put in place.

As a customer, you maintain full control of your content that you upload to the AWS services under your AWS account, and responsibility for configuring access to AWS services and resources. We provide an advanced set of access, encryption, and logging features to help you do this effectively (e.g.,
AWS Identity and Access Management
,
AWS Organizations
and
AWS CloudTrail
). We also provide APIs for you to configure access control permissions for any of the services you develop or deploy in an AWS environment. We do not access or use your content for any purpose without your agreement. We do not use your content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising purposes.
You choose the AWS Region(s) in which your content is stored. You can replicate and back up your content in more than one AWS Region. We will not move or replicate your content outside of your chosen AWS Region(s) without your agreement.
You choose how your content is secured. We offer you industry-leading encryption features to protect your content in transit and at rest, and we provide you with the option to manage your own encryption keys. These data protection features include:
Data encryption capabilities available in over 100 AWS services
.
Flexible key management options using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
, allowing customers to choose whether to have AWS manage their encryption keys or keep complete control over their keys.
Securityassurance program, using best practices for security and data protection to help you operate securely within AWS, and to make the best use of our security control environment. These security protections and control processes are independently validated by
multiple third-party independent assessments
.
We will not disclose customer content (see How does AWS classify customer information? below) unless we're required to do so to comply with the law or a valid and binding order of a government body. If a governmental body sends AWS a demand for your customer content, we will attempt to redirect the governmental body to request that data directly from you. If compelled to disclose your customer content to a government body, we will give you reasonable notice of the demand to allow you to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless AWS is legally prohibited from doing so.
We define customer content as software (including machine images), data, text, audio, video, or images that a customer or any end user transfers to us for processing, storage, or hosting by AWS services in connection with a customer's account, and any computational results that a customer or their end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services. For example, customer content includes content that a customer or their end user stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Customer content does not include account information, which we describe below. Customer content also does not include information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items. The terms of the
AWS Customer Agreement
and the
AWS Service Terms
apply to your customer content.
We define account information as information about a customer that a customer provides to us in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account. For example, account information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing information associated with a customer account. The information practices described in the
AWS Privacy Notice
apply to account information.
As a customer, you own your customer content, and you select which AWS services can process, store, and host your customer content. We do not access or use your customer content for any purpose without your agreement. We do not use customer content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising.
As a customer, you control your content:
You determine the geographic region where your customer content will be stored and the type of storage.
You choose the secured state of your customer content. We offer you industry-leading encryption features to protect your content in transit and at rest, and we provide you with the option to manage your own encryption keys.
You manage access to your customer content, and access to AWS services and resources through users, groups, permissions, and credentials that you control.
The
AWS Privacy Notice
describes how we collect and use account information.
AWS uses that information to provide the AWS services, and to protect and improve the customer experience. For example, AWS uses resource identifiers to help customers generate cost and usage reports, which can be used to break down AWS spend by cost center, and IAM permissions to determine whether a specific user can purchase reserved instances. When customers contact AWS for technical assistance, AWS may also analyze resource identifiers and permissions to help resolve their issues.
We are vigilant about our customers' privacy. We will not disclose customer content unless we're required to do so to comply with the law or a valid and binding order of a governmental body. If a governmental body sends AWS a demand for customer content, we will attempt to redirect the governmental body to request that data directly from the customer. Governmental and regulatory bodies need to follow the applicable legal process to obtain valid and binding orders. We review all orders and object to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate ones. If compelled to disclose customer content to a government body, we will give customers reasonable notice of the demand to allow the customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless AWS is legally prohibited from doing so. It is also important to point out that our customers can encrypt their customer content, and we provide customers with the option to manage their own encryption keys.
We know that transparency matters to our customers, so we regularly publish a report about the types and volume of information requests we receive on the
Amazon Information Requests
webpage.
The
AWS Global Infrastructure
gives you the flexibility to choose where and how you want to run your workloads using the same network, control plane, APIs, and AWS services. If you would like to run your applications globally you can choose from any of the AWS Regions and Availability Zones. As a customer, you choose the AWS Region(s) in which your customer content is stored, allowing you to deploy AWS services in the location(s) of your choice, in accordance with your specific geographic requirements. For example, if an AWS customer in Australia wants to store their data only in Australia, they can choose to deploy their AWS services exclusively in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) AWS Region. If you want to discover other flexible storage options see the
AWS Regions
webpage.
You can also replicate and back up your customer content in more than one AWS Region. We will not move or replicate your content outside of your chosen AWS Region(s), except as necessary to provide the services you initiated, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. However, it is important to note that some AWS services may not be available in all AWS Regions. For more information about which services are available in which AWS Regions, see the
AWS Regional Services
webpage.
When evaluating the security of a cloud solution, it is important for you to understand and distinguish between the security of the cloud, and your security in the cloud. Security of the cloud encompasses the security measures that AWS implements and operates. We are responsible for security of the cloud. Security in the cloud encompasses the security measures that you implement and operate, related to the AWS services you use. You are responsible for your security in the cloud. For more information, see the
AWS Shared Responsibility
webpage.
At AWS, our highest priority is securing our customers’ data, and we implement rigorous contractual, technical, and organizational measures to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability regardless of which AWS Region a customer has selected.
AWS complies with ISO 27018, a code of practice that focuses on protection of personal data in the cloud. It extends ISO information security standard 27001 to cover the regulatory requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data for the public cloud computing environment and specifies implementation guidance based on ISO 27002 controls that is applicable to PII processed by public cloud service providers. For more information, or to view the AWS ISO 27018 Certification, see the
AWS ISO 27018 Compliance
webpage.
Additionally, AWS publishes a SOC 2 Type II Privacy report, based on the SOC 2 Privacy Trust Criteria developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), which establishes criteria for evaluating controls related to how personal data is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed to meet the entity’s objectives. The AWS SOC 2 Type II Privacy report provides third-party attestation of our systems and the suitability of the design of our privacy controls. The scope of the privacy report includes information about how we handle the content that you upload to AWS and how it is protected in all of the services and locations that are in scope for the latest
AWS SOC reports
. The SOC 2 Type II Privacy report can be downloaded through
AWS Artifact
in the
AWS Management Console
.
We recommend that customers with questions regarding AWS and data protection contact their AWS account manager. If customers have signed up for Enterprise Support, they can also reach out to their Technical Account Manager (TAM) for support. AWS account managers and TAMs work with Solutions Architects to help customers meet their compliance needs. AWS can’t provide legal advice to customers, and we recommend that customers consult their legal counsel if they have legal questions regarding data protection.
We also have teams of Enterprise Support Representatives, Professional Services Consultants, and other staff to help with privacy questions. You can contact us with questions
here
.
From beginners to experts, we've got digital training courses to fit every skill level.

We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our Subscribers.

As part of these surveys we may collect personal data, such as your name, contact information, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions. Participation in surveys is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the survey, which will describe any financial incentives associated with that survey and how to participate. The value of your data is the value of the offer presented to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit. You may withdraw from any financial incentive at any time by emailing us at

b. Your Data Protection Rights:
Subject to legal limitations, certain California residents may have the below rights.
Right to Know.
You have the right to request information about the categories of personal data we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the personal data, the purposes for collecting the personal data, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your personal data, and the purpose for which we disclosed your personal data (“
Categories Report
”). You may also request information about the specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you (“
Specific Pieces Report
”).
Right to Delete.
You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we have collected from you.
Right to Correct.
You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you.
Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.
We do not sell personal data to third parties in exchange for money. However, as we explain in
Section 5
, we share information with advertising partners and allow advertising partners to collect information from our Digital Properties. This exchange may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under California law, and you have the right to opt out of this “sale” or “sharing” of personal data.
California residents may request to exercise the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, and the Right to Correct by using our
webform
. We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.
How to Fully Exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing:
In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing with respect to any “sale” or “sharing” of information, you must undertake both of the following steps:
Submit a Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request using our
webform
; and
Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our website footer. You must complete this step on each of our Sites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.
If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request for device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear the cookies in your browser, you will need to follow Step 2 above again. To the extent required by California law, we will honor “Do Not Sell or Share” opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly-used and recognized by businesses at the browser level, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object.
Verification:
To process California data protection requests, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will request information about you, which may include your name, email address, or other information. If you submit a Right to Know “Specific Pieces Report,” we may also request a signed declaration, under penalty of perjury, that you are who you say you are. We may request alternative information under certain circumstances and/or use third parties to help verify your identity.
Authorized Agents:
Authorized agents may exercise California data protection rights on behalf of California individuals, but we reserve the right to verify the individual’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request through our
webform
and indicate that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf by providing signed permission from you. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
Timing:
We will process Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing requests within fifteen business days from the date we received the request. We will respond to Requests to Delete and Requests to Know within forty-five days unless we need more time, in which case we will notify you, and it may take up to ninety days to respond to your request.
11. Supplemental Information for the EEA, Switzerland, and the U.K.
The following terms supplement the Notice with respect to our processing of EEA (i.e., European Union Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), Swiss, and U.K. personal data. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the other parts of the Notice and the terms of this Section 11, Section 11 shall govern and prevail with regard to the processing of EEA, Swiss, and U.K. Personal Data, to the extent applicable.
Data Controller:
The Zendesk entity with which you have a primary relationship (such as the entity that concluded the Services contract with you; the entity that has provided you with marketing materials and promotional communications; or the primary entity in the region where you access our Site) is the controller within the scope of this Notice. In the majority of cases, this will be Zendesk, Inc., unless we specifically inform you otherwise.
a. Legal Basis for Processing:
Please see
Section 3
for the legal basis on which we rely for the collection, processing, and use of personal data.
b. Your Data Protection Rights:
Under applicable data protection laws, you may exercise certain rights regarding your personal data:
Right to Access.
You have the right to obtain confirmation from us whether we are processing your personal data and related information, as well as the right to obtain a copy of your personal data undergoing processing.
Right to Data Portability.
You may receive your personal data, that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly-used, and machine-readable format, and you may have the right to transmit it to other data controllers without hindrance. This right only exists if the processing is based on your consent or a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means.
