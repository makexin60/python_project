WorkJam Privacy Policy
Effective date: September 25, 2024
We’ve done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle Personal Information (as this term is defined below) we collect and receive about users and applies to all of the services offered by WorkJam. These “Services” include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else offered by WorkJam that links to or refers to this policy. The Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the WorkJam platform, or any other third-party products, services or businesses who will provide their services under their own terms of service and privacy policy.
By using any WorkJam Services, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services. From time-to-time it will be necessary for us to make updates to this policy. Your continued use of our web site and / or Services following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.
1. Definition of “Personal Information”:
“Personal Information” means any information that identifies, or could be reasonably associated with, an individual and their household (collectively, “individual” or “you”). This may include, for example, your name, email address and information relating to your account with us (as the case may be). It may also include other types of more technical information, but only when this information can identify you as an individual. Information that is aggregated and/or de-identified and cannot be associated with an identifiable individual is not considered to be personal information. Please note that the definition of personal information may differ in various jurisdictions.
2. How WorkJam collects, uses, and shares Personal Information:
Your Personal Information will be used by WorkJam to provide the Services in accordance with any applicable Terms of Use and as required by applicable law.
When using any of our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer,  storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. By supplying information to us, you authorize WorkJam to use your information in the  jurisdictions where WorkJam operates.
There are two basic categories of Personal Information we collect: (i) Personal Information you provide and (ii) Personal Information we get when you use our Services. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is reasonably required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We do not disclose your Personal Information except in the limited circumstances described within this policy.
Here is a little bit more detail about how we collect and use your Personal Information:
a. Account information
When you create or reconfigure a WorkJam account, you provide some Personal Information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Your name and username are listed on our Services, including on your profile section but only within your employer’s instance of our WorkJam app.
You may also provide us with additional information to make available to others within your employer’s WorkJam instance, such as picture and video and other information about yourself. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from various types of notifications from WorkJam. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your WorkJam account to your account on another service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.
b. Other information
Our Services are primarily designed to help you manage your work schedule and communicate with your employer and other co-workers. Information you share with us is information you are asking us to use to accomplish these and other related tasks. This includes your activity on the service including messages you write and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. We may use this information to customize the content we show you.
c. Location information
We only validate your location when using specific functions of the Services to determine if you are at your employer’s location and allowed to access functions that are determined by your employer to only be available to you when at your work location. This is only possible if you grant WorkJam such permission in your mobile device’s location settings. WorkJam does not track your movements or use your location information for any other purpose.
d. Links
WorkJam may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant content, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
e. Cookies
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is
transferred to your computer’s hard disk. WorkJam may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies completely.
f. Third-parties
WorkJam uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our web site and blogs, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads.
Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. WorkJam currently does not take action in response to these signals.
To the exent your Personal Information is shared with third-parties service provides, such services are always subject to contractual undertakings consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that such third-parties use your Personal Information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
g. Law and harm
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect WorkJam’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third-party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your Personal Information.
3. Additional protection when your Personal Information is transferred to another jurisdiction:
In the provision of our Services, WorkJam may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries other than the one in which you live. To the extent Personal Information is transferred abroad, WorkJam will ensure compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws in the respective jurisdiction in line with WorkJam’s obligations.
4. How WorkJam protects Personal Information:
WorkJam takes the security of your Personal Information very seriously and is committed to protecting your privacy by using a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. For example:
We store the data you provide in controlled facilities;
We use HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into) one of our Services, which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;
We limit access to personal information to employees and third parties who need that access to perform their jobs for us;
We provide company-wide training on privacy and data security.
Your Personal Information may be stored in foreign jurisdictions, in which case it will be subject to foreign laws. We will store your Personal Information in accordance with our retention policies or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
5.
How WorkJam manages your consent and modifying your privacy choices:
As mentioned earlier in this Privacy Policy, when using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your Personal Information. In some cases, your consent may be “implied” i.e., your permission is assumed based on your action or inaction at the point of collection, use or sharing of your Personal Information.
We will seek to obtain consent when we want to use Personal Information for a new purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of collection in this Privacy Policy. You may be entitled under applicable law to withdraw your consent (except in limited circumstances, including legal or regulatory requirements or as a result of your contractual obligations with us).
If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, or if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may not be able to offer you the Services or information that you requested or that could be offered to you. If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request access to your Personal Information, as well as to seek to update, delete, or correct this information.
6. WorkJam’s Policy Towards Children Privacy:
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13 and we do not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information without parental or legal guardian consent, please contact us at
privacy@workjam.com
. If we become aware that a child under 13 has, unknowingly to us, provided us with Personal Information without verifiable parental or legal guardian consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.
7. Your California Privacy Rights:
This section provides additional details about the Personal Information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA,” as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act or “CPRA”.
California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Information that we collect and disclose for certain “business purposes,” such as to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products, and to such other entities as described in earlier sections of Privacy Policy. In addition to the information provided above in the section titled “How WorkJam collects, uses and shares Personal Information”, we collect the following categories of Personal Information from you, your employer and third-party service providers for our business purposes:
Identifiers/contact information;
Internet or electronic network activity information;
Geolocation information;
Professional or employment-related information;
Audio and visual data;
In limited circumstances where allowed by law, information that may be protected under California or United States law; and
Inferences drawn from any of the above categories.
We collect and share this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the section titled “How WorkJam collects, uses and shares Personal Information”. WorkJam does not sell (as such term is defined in the CCPA or otherwise) the Personal Information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). We may also allow third parties to collect Personal Information from our sites or Services if those third parties are authorized service providers who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Information, or if you use our sites or Services to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your Personal Information to third parties.
Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collect (including how we use, disclose, or may sell this information), to delete their Personal Information, to opt out of any “sales”, to know and opt out of sharing of Personal Information for delivering advertisements on non-WorkJam websites, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at
privacy@workjam.com
. We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Government identification may be required. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf. Authorized agents must submit proof of authorization.
8. Accountability and EU/UK Representative:
WorkJam has designated a Privacy Officer who must ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws.
