As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to this site. However, as with most sites, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of our server. Such information may include; the name of the ISP from which you access the internet, the Search Engine and keywords you used to locate this site, the date and time you accessed the site, the internet address of the website from which you enter our site and where you go after you leave our site.

We will not use the information for other purposes, and generally we do not share it with anyone outside of Irish Continental Group plc. Some of the information voluntarily provided as part of your reply to any offers communicated on our website may be provided to third party vendors for processing.
If you provide us with your e-mail address, we will not use it for any purpose other than possibly responding to the message you have sent. However, we cannot currently respond to any messages that are sent to us outside of our normal channels for communications.
