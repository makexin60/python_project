Privacy Policy
Effective date: February 16, 2024
Welcome to the privacy policy for applications and websites developed by Tanner Christensen. I understand the importance of privacy and am committed to creating a safe and secure environment for all. This privacy policy outlines practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of your information when you use something I have built.
1. Information Not Collected
I, Tanner Christensen, do not collect any personal information about users. This means I do not collect information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other data that could directly identify you.
The only time I can see any information about you is if you contact me directly and provide any of that information yourself.
2. Anonymous Data Collection
While I do not collect personal information, my apps may automatically collect anonymous data that does not identify you personally. This data is used solely for the purpose of improving the app's functionality and includes:
Usage Data: Information on how the app is used, such as features accessed or time spent in the app.
Device Data: Non-personal information about the device used, such as the operating system version and device type.
3. Use of Collected Data
Any anonymous data collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:
To enhance and optimize an app's performance and user experience.
To identify and fix technical issues within the app.
To guide future updates and feature development.
4. Data Sharing
I firmly believe in the privacy of users. Therefore, I do not share, sell, rent, or trade any data collected by the app with third parties for any reasons.
5. Data Security
I take the security of the data collected seriously. Although no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your anonymous data.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The date of any updates will be made clear at the top of the page. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
7. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me through one or more of the Contact options available in the product you are using.
Thank you.
