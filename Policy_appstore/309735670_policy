The Scope of Indeed’s Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers data that we collect through the Sites, directly from data subjects, or that we obtain from third parties. In cases where you follow a link to a third-party website, you are no longer covered by our Privacy Policy, and any data collection or processing activity that takes place on that website will be governed by that website’s own privacy policy. We only collect data on the Sites that display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.
In accordance with our Terms, the Site is generally only for use by people aged 16 or over. However, some jurisdictions have different age restrictions, as outlined below.
Japan:  For users in Japan, the Site is only for use by those who meet the permitted minimum age under Japanese law for Indeed to lawfully provide you with use of the Site.
EEA, Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine:  As of 1 February 2024, access to the Site in the EEA, as well as Switzerland, UK, Turkey, and Ukraine, is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older.
In all jurisdictions, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use the Sites under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult even if your age is above the Indeed permitted use age for that jurisdiction.
We adopt a range of measures to try to ensure that no information is knowingly solicited from individuals who do not meet the minimum age or any other applicable age requirements.
If we learn that an individual who does not meet the minimum age requirement has used the Site or provided personal information through the Site, we will restrict access to, or close their account, and remove that information from our systems.
Applicants to internal jobs at Indeed should reference the
Recruitment Privacy Policy
.
Current and former employees of Indeed should reach out to their Human Resources partner to reference the Global Employee Privacy Notice.
Data collection and use
Learn about the types of data Indeed uses to support the services we provide.
Indeed uses different types of information in order to provide our Sites’ services, products, and features to you.  The Personal Data we collect and process may vary, depending on how you use our Sites.
If Personal Data is required, to provide particular Indeed services or features to you, it will be indicated at the time of collection. If Personal Data is required and you choose not to provide it, then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
Information that Indeed collects
In accordance with applicable data protection laws in the EEA, controllers must have a legal basis to process information. This means we rely on different legal bases to process your information, depending on the purpose of processing outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Full details of the types of personal data we collect from you, the purpose of processing it, our processing operations, and details of the legal bases we rely upon for GDPR are detailed below.
Retention of Your Information
Where Indeed acts as a controller of your Personal Data, we retain such data until it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose it is being used for, as required by applicable laws,  or until you ask us to delete it.
Information on how long we retain your information, for each purpose, is set out in the following section. In determining these appropriate retention periods, we consider the purposes for which we process Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider the extent, nature, and sensitivity of Personal Data and our legal obligations with respect to data. Where possible and relying on our legitimate interest in improving our Sites, Indeed anonymizes or aggregates Personal Data, so that it can no longer be associated with or identify a user, in which case Indeed can further process the information. For example, we may use anonymized job seeker data, such as your profile data to test the accuracy of our products and services. Another way we may use anonymized data is to make sure our technology is helping all people get jobs in a way that is fair.
Where Indeed acts as Processor of your Personal Data, we store such data until instructed to delete it by the Controller.

Additional Purposes and Disclosures of Information
Profile data
By creating a searchable profile through the Site including when you upload a file resume on the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your profile data to third parties, in accordance with our
Indeed General Terms of Service
. When you create a profile on Indeed, it is set to searchable by default. This means that profile data (searchable) including your resume data, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers.
Please note Employers and Employer representatives who access your profile data while it is set to searchable visibility, or to whom you apply with your not searchable profile, may choose to share your profile with additional parties. Indeed is not responsible for such sharing. Similarly, when you share your searchable profile directly with a personalized link, we cannot control who sees your profile when you share that link.
You may change your profile privacy settings at any time. If you do not want Indeed to make your profile data (searchable) available to third parties without your direction or if you do not want Employers to contact you, you can set your profile to not searchable. If you would like to learn more about your profile, including the differences between searchable and not searchable private profile and how to change your profile privacy settings please see our
FAQ
.
Please note that as we continue to improve the Site, you may see phrases like ‘Employers can find you’ and ‘Employers can’t find you’. These phrases are to enhance user understanding and are synonymous with the terms ‘Searchable’ and ‘Not Searchable’ respectively.
Employer Accounts
We offer users the ability to link Employer accounts together. Linked users can be assigned specific roles, which provide varying levels of access to the candidate Personal Data contained in the parent account. If you are an Employer and you invite other Indeed users to link their accounts to yours, you agree that such linked users may have access to any and all information in your account. Types of candidate Personal Data include resume contacts, application materials and statuses, communications with applicants, any action taken by you or another user linked to the account, when you took that action, and billing information within the account. When an Employer account is delinked, either by your own action or an administrator’s action, you will lose access to all candidate Personal Data in the linked account.
Resume Review Services
In certain markets, we may also offer additional resume review services to help Job Seekers build and improve their resumes. For example, this can include helping you understand how your resume may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume, or a personalized resume review video. In providing these services, Indeed may give you feedback, including questions and comments on the contents of your resume, about Your Resume or other materials you submit through the services. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to Employers.
Automated Processing of Your Personal Data
We perform automated processing of Personal Data to evaluate specific aspects relating to a user and to analyze and predict a user’s preferences and interests. Where we perform this processing, we do so either on the basis of user consent or performance of a contract, whereby such processing is necessary for us to provide our services to Job Seekers and Employers. For example, such processing allows us to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and invitations to take action on jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, to send application status notifications on behalf of Employers, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users. Such processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users. You may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to exercise your rights or contest any decision generated by said automated processing.
How we use Artificial Intelligence or “AI”
Indeed’s mission is to help people get jobs. To achieve this, job seekers and employers must be able to easily and quickly find one another and be equipped with information that may be helpful in understanding if a job seeker and employer are a good match. In support of these goals, we use personal data to develop, train, build, and use statistical models, including artificial intelligence (“
AI
”), to improve some of our products.
We use AI to provide candidate highlights which is a summary of your information, personalize outreach messages for employers, and offer job-based matched candidates. We use your personal data, including profile information and activity data to provide matched candidates, which is powered by Indeed. AI-generated outreach messages and candidate highlights leverage our partnership with vendors acting on our behalf. These AI features help job seekers and employers connect over potential employment opportunities.
Indeed may in some jurisdictions enable chatbots, which allow you to take certain actions on the Site, such as applying to a job, scheduling an interview, or otherwise interacting with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“
Chatbot
”). We use the information you share in a chat with a Chatbot to provide more personalized responses or relevant information in that conversation, when you are seeking to take certain actions on the Site such as applying to a job, scheduling an interview, or otherwise interacting with the Site. If you use Indeed Coworker, a Chatbot whose responses are powered by our vendor, will be processed by Indeed and the vendor.
Our AI capabilities are continuously evolving as we innovate to provide personalized experiences, return relevant search results, and improve matches. These advancements aim to make the job search and hiring process faster and simpler. Indeed is committed to investing in these areas and will continue to develop and deploy solutions to achieve these goals, ultimately making it easier for job seekers to find jobs and for employers to find the right candidates.You can find more details on
Indeed’s AI Principles
and Responsible AI at Indeed within our ESG hub. We’ll continue to build on these efforts and integrate additional privacy safeguards as we improve our generative AI technologies.

Transfers of Information to Job Seekers
Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers. This includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on the Sites and publishing Job Listings on third-party websites. Indeed may also make available certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers, such as information about an Employer’s activity and responsiveness on the Sites. This can include the Employer representative’s name, the Employer’s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken or has chosen not to take an action with regard to the Job Seeker’s resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers’ resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it. We do this in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities. As an Employer, when you use the Sites (for example by posting a Job Listing or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.
Transfers of Information to Service Providers and other third parties
We use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Sites and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize our services and our users’ experiences. By using our Sites, you acknowledge Indeed’s use of such third-parties, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of collecting, processing, analyzing, and recording your activity on, interaction with, and communications with, or through our Sites.

Indeed will not sell or rent data collected from the Indeed Interview Updates or Recruiter Invitations short code programs to third parties for marketing purposes.
Transfer of information to partners
In certain markets, Indeed works with partners who are involved in helping Job Seekers find opportunities. These partnerships introduce Job Seekers to Indeed and our services. These types of partnerships help Indeed understand the needs of Job Seekers in diverse audiences and how we can improve our services for diverse audiences. In some instances, Indeed shares limited information back to our partners about Job Seekers. For example,  confirmation that a Job Seeker has created an Indeed account or used one of our Sites successfully (for example, by applying to a certain number of jobs or utilizing our career guides). We strive to help all Job Seekers find jobs but we are primarily a website, so these partnerships help us reach audiences that may not come to Indeed through regular internet use. These partners may advertise their career services in partnership with Indeed. For the avoidance of doubt, where partners are co-branded on the site, each entity is a separate controller of your Personal Data.
Transfers of Publicly Available Information
When users post content on the Sites in a manner that is intended to make that content searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties. For example, if an Employer posts a job on the Sites, Indeed may share that Job Listing or information contained within that Job Listing with third parties, at Indeed’s discretion and subject to agreement with such third parties. Indeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.
Transfers of information from service providers
Indeed may collect and use information about users obtained from third-party platforms such as social networking sites for the following purposes:
To classify and quantitatively understand the number of responses and spread of marketing campaign measures such as TV commercials;
To monitor the reputation of Indeed’s services to understand what is appreciated and what is not, and use this information in communication plans;
For early detection of improvements to the service, monitoring of user feedback, and planning of countermeasures;
To provide support for users who do not know how to use Indeed’s services;
To find product defects (e.g., “When I try to open the application, it displays a 501 error and I can’t use it” or “I can’t apply for a job”) and escalate the issue to the development team
Links to Third-Party Sites
The Sites may make available links to other third-party websites. When you click on such links, you may leave our Sites. Your web browser may also disclose to the third-party website the URL of the Sites page you clicked from, and this URL may include search terms and filters you used on the Sites. The Sites may also make available Company Pages, which may contain information provided by third-party Employers.
Indeed is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please consult their individual privacy policies to learn more.

Introduction: What is a cookie?
This Cookie Policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Sites. Cookies are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment. Cookies allow the Sites to remember important information that will make your use of the Sites more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Sites regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Sites. Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). We use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Sites. We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Sites to help customize your experience. We may associate Personal Data with a cookie file in those instances.

Introduction
We take your personal data seriously
Welcome to the HR Tech Privacy Center – a website detailing how multiple online job search and recruitment
platforms
share data and protect privacy. The Indeed Platform includes the
Indeed sites
, and the Glassdoor Platform includes the
Glassdoor sites
(together, the “Platforms”). For more details about the appropriate data controller for each platform, please check
Indeed Privacy Policy
and
Glassdoor Privacy Policy

Our core mission is to help people get jobs and help employers find great candidates. We developed this website to help you learn more about our
Privacy Values
, how your data is shared between these platforms, and why it’s important for us to share it.
Sharing data between the Platforms allows us to:
Help connect job seekers with more job listings and employers
Improve and customize services for our users
Enhance security for our users
You can find out about how we share data between the Platforms
below
or find answers to some
frequently asked questions
.
The information provided here doesn’t change how each of the Indeed sites and the Glassdoor sites collects, uses, or shares personal data. The Privacy and Cookie policies for each site clearly explain how we collect and use personal and non-personal data.
If you have specific questions about a particular platform, we encourage you to visit that Platform’s Privacy Policy or the Contact Us page for further information.
Our privacy values
Prioritizing your trust
Whether we’re helping you find jobs or great candidates, we value the trust you place in us. To maintain that trust, we make significant investments to protect your personal data. These efforts are guided by our privacy values:
We treat all users equally by providing a broad suite of global privacy rights. Any user can request the following:
access to and portability of their personal data

restriction of or objection to certain processing of their personal data
We adhere to principles of privacy by design, which informs how we build and operate our services.
We’re transparent about what personal data we collect and how it’s processed.
We want to ensure the personal data we gather will be used for the purposes of helping our job seekers find jobs, our employers find great candidates, and improving the services we provide to you.
We limit our collection and storage of personal data to what’s adequate, relevant, and necessary.
We strive to keep your personal data accurate and up to date, where appropriate.
We want to process your personal data using appropriate security measures to protect personal data.
We demonstrate accountability and responsibility under applicable privacy laws.
The benefits of data sharing
Why do you need my data anyway?
Data sharing not only provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers, but it also enables us to improve our services.
Data sharing means more employers, more job listings, and more job seekers
Data sharing between the Platforms allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers. It also helps employers access more job seekers. For example, one platform may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another platform. It can also help applications, resumes, or job listings work across the Platforms.  The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the platforms in the course of your job search and application activities.
The Platforms can also share employer data, such as account information and behavioral information, to provide a better experience to those employers.
Data sharing improves our services
Data sharing allows our Platforms to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features, and services.
For example, our Platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on) and your profile data, including resume to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Data sharing may also help provide career insights such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips, and more.
This sharing also helps improve data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement across our Platforms.
Data sharing facilitates better security
Sharing data allows our Platforms to better protect our users. In particular, it allows affiliated Platforms to improve user security and internal operations. It also facilitates troubleshooting and detection, and prevention of fraud and spam.
Platform activity recording
What we do with the data
We process your activity on the Platforms to help us better understand how you use them. This helps us improve and inform the products and services we offer. All of which allows us to help you find jobs.
It’s important to note that our Platforms may not work as intended without certain data collection and sharing. This includes processing, collecting, analyzing, storing, and sharing personal data across the Platforms or with third-party service providers, including in real-time.
Data collected can include any and all interactions and communications you have on our Platforms. It may also include without limitation the areas of the Platforms you visit and where you click, scroll, hover, mouseover, or otherwise interact with our Platforms. It may also include when and for how long each activity occurs.
For more information, please see the Privacy and Cookie policies for each Platform.
We consider this processing to be critical to the way our Platforms operate, and, at this time, without transferring certain data to Indeed’s affiliates, we are not able to provide our core products and services to you. Please, check our FAQ to understand how you can stop this sharing.

Selective pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data
Designing internal systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our processing systems and services

Indeed values each of its users’ privacy.  We’ve invested significant resources into building a global privacy framework that bakes privacy-by-design into our product development lifecycle and affords all of our users the same rights to access and delete their personal data.
We very much value the trust jobseekers place in us to help them find great jobs, and employers place in us to help them find great candidates. Our
Privacy Policy
and
Privacy Center
help us maintain this trust by giving all of our users a comprehensive look into the types of information we collect and how we use and disclose this information to deliver our products and services globally.
How does Indeed process user data?

Privacy Policy
(for example section 4, Purposes, Uses and Disclosures of Information,) details the ways in which Indeed processes personal data and the purposes of such processing. This includes but is not limited to using data to improve Indeed products, determine user preferences, help detect fraudulent activity, and for certain marketing purposes.
How does Indeed share user data with its affiliates?
As detailed in our
Privacy Policy
, Indeed shares certain user data with its affiliates to:
help the job search and recruitment process by connecting more job seekers with more job listings and employers;
improve our services to you; and
facilitate better security for users.

privacy values
and certain
data sharing practices
between the Indeed-affiliated companies and brands.
What is the GDPR?
On May 25, 2018, the European Union (EU) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) .  The GDPR established a comprehensive framework for protecting individual’s personal data by defining individual rights and the obligations for businesses around transparency, security and accountability in all processing of personal data.
What is Indeed doing to comply with GDPR?
The GDPR introduced stronger rights and protections for individuals, and created new obligations for businesses in terms of how they process individuals’ personal data. We are excited about doing what is best for our users, and have introduced changes in accordance with the GDPR and its principles.
Indeed’s
Privacy Policy
, which is easily accessible by all users, clearly informs users of the personal data collected by Indeed, and the different processing activities that take place.
Indeed also employs applicable privacy principles, and has introduced certain changes to support additional user rights and satisfy all of our obligations. Some examples of those changes are set out below.
We will continue to increase transparency and communication with our users to provide you with as clear an understanding as possible about how your personal data is processed.
We will facilitate the rights of individuals introduced by GDPR, including the rights of individuals to access and/or delete their personal data upon request.
Those rights are available to all of Indeed’s users on a global basis.
We will remain dedicated to the approach of “privacy by design and default” through the consistent application of the privacy principles in the GDPR, and the adoption of a privacy-friendly approach in how we build and operate our products and services.
What is the CCPA and CPRA?
On January 1, 2020, the California legislature introduced the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  The CCPA is a first-of-its-kind privacy framework in the United States (US), delivering a new standard of transparency for businesses collecting California residents’ personal data.  Among other things, the CCPA offers California residents new consumer rights around accessing and deleting their personal data collected by businesses, and redefines how businesses must account for certain transfers of California residents’ personal data. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), an amendment to the CCPA which expands consumer rights and the obligations of businesses to recognize those rights. Together, these acts are referred to as “the CCPA.”
What is Indeed doing to comply with the CCPA?
Indeed has taken a number of measures to satisfy this new law, and other laws, by building on Indeed’s existing privacy framework. A few examples include:
furthering the transparency of Indeed’s comprehensive Privacy Policy with a new summary, concisely listing the types of data that Indeed collects and how it uses and discloses this data;
launching a new Privacy Center, helping users further understand the relationships between Indeed and its affiliated entities and brands;
expanding Indeed’s consumer rights request infrastructure with a new request form and toll-free telephone number for submitting requests, and enhanced data mapping; and
integrating new links to the “Your Privacy Choices” page on Indeed’s Site to reflect the CCPA’s approach to defining and regulating the “sale” and “share” of users’ data and the use of “sensitive personal information.”
Indeed’s
Privacy Policy
provides more information for California residents.

may
be a “sale” or “share” under the CCPA?

What is Indeed doing to comply with the LGPD?
Indeed takes a global approach to protect the privacy of our users and the rights they are afforded by laws such as the LGPD. Indeed and its associated sites provide an accessible way for our users to avail of the rights they are afforded by the LGPD, including the rights to access and delete personal information. Indeed has also taken measures to comply with the other requirements of the LGPD such as appointing a DPO (Data Protection Officer), ensuring proper transparency, and more.
How does Indeed manage transfers of personal data from Europe?
Where appropriate, Indeed Ireland’s transfers of Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to jurisdictions outside the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are performed using lawful transfer mechanisms pursuant to GDPR. For example, transfers are typically based on the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses. These agreements also incorporate the protections and requirements provided for under Chapter V (and Article 28, where appropriate) of the GDPR.
What information does Indeed transfer to third parties?
Indeed may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Site and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize the services and users’ experiences. These service providers may have access to Personal Data in the course of providing these services, which may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries. Such transfers are only made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this
Privacy Policy
, to the extent applicable and necessary. Those companies are also required to treat such Personal Data in accordance with this
Privacy Policy
, and in accordance with all applicable laws with respect to such transfers and any processing performed by those third parties on such Personal Data.
We do this for a number of reasons, for example: to improve our services to you; to maintain quality and protect users; to facilitate payments (where applicable); to permit user log-in through third party accounts; or to understand and optimize our users’ customer journey.
What information is shared with third parties when the Indeed App is installed?
In order to provide you with certain services and support ad attribution, limited user data may be shared with certain service providers when you install, download or use the Indeed App. This may include your IP address or other unique identifier, and event data related to the installation of the Indeed App.
This may be done for a variety of purposes, including facilitating user log-in through third party accounts. It may also assist Indeed to understand and optimize our users’ complete customer journey by helping us: (i) understand how users arrive to Indeed; (ii) better measure the performance of our ads; and (iii) understand where a user has accessed Indeed through different devices.
When you download or install an Indeed App, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Data may be transferred to these service providers. You also agree to Indeed’s Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and are informed that you may avail of your rights at any time, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, including the right to object to the legitimate interest use of your personal data for marketing purposes.
Examples of the types of technologies that may support this behavior include pixels, javascript snippets, or cookies.
What is the conversion tracker?
Indeed may provide an employer with code for a Conversion Tracker to place on its website that pings the job seeker web beacon and tracks whenever a job seeker has applied to a job on that employer’s website. This Conversion Tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity, and a conversion count will be displayed on the employer dashboard. Data may be shared from the employer to Indeed for the purposes of displaying unique applications. The Conversion Tracker is simply a counter that notifies Indeed that a job seeker has applied, and also has the ability to count applications across devices if a job seeker is logged in to the employer’s website.
How do individuals make a personal data access request?
Indeed users are able to access most of their Personal Data held by Indeed on the Site.  If you have any queries or complaints we encourage you to contact us

Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

How do I unsubscribe from any marketing messages from Indeed?
If you wish to opt out of a particular marketing email from Indeed, you may do so by clicking “unsubscribe from this email” (or an equivalent action) where applicable. Please note that this will only opt you out of that particular marketing message.
If you wish to adjust all your job alerts, you can click on “manage my subscriptions” (or an equivalent action) to adjust your subscriptions. You can also access and adjust your subscriptions (for job alerts, recommended jobs, and other notifications) from your account dashboard, or contact
Indeed Customer Support

In your message, please detail which activities from which you wish to opt out or withdraw your consent. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, and in accordance with applicable laws.

How long does Indeed retain personal data?
Indeed retains personal data to the extent necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data are collected or processed, which are communicated in our
Privacy Policy
, or where necessary for compliance with a legal obligation. For example, records detailing a business transaction and/or business relationship are retained as allowed by applicable laws. Where the personal data we store no longer needs to be stored for the reasons outlined above, Indeed deletes such personal data, subject to applicable legal requirements.
What security measures are adopted by Indeed?
Indeed seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, and destruction and accidental loss of Personal Data under Indeed’s control, although no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  The practices Indeed follows vary depending on the nature of the data, the context of the processing, and the risks involved, as well as available technology.
With respect to data transfers, Indeed relies on the use of data transfer and processing agreements that employ both the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses and the protections provided for under Chapter V (and Article 28, where appropriate) of the GDPR.
For more information on some of the steps we take and advice on steps you can take to help keep your information safe during your job seeking journey, please visit our
Security
page.
What is a Not Searchable Profile?
Profiles that are not searchable on the site are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker applied or shared their resume. If you prefer not to have your Profile available to third parties or do not want Employers to contact you, you can set your Indeed Profile and uploaded resume to “not searchable”
or “cannot be found” (“
Not Searchable
”). This can be done by going to your “Profile” page and changing the settings to “not searchable” or “employers can’t find you on Indeed.”
When you apply to jobs or share your Profile with Employers, your Profile might be copied and published even if it is set to Not Searchable. You can change your Profile privacy settings at any time, but setting your Profile to Not Searchable will not affect your previous applications or stop employers you responded to from contacting or reaching out to you.
When your Profile is set to Searchable, search engines and other third parties can copy it and make it publicly available elsewhere. Indeed does not control these third parties. If your Profile is copied, changing it to Not Searchable on Indeed will not affect those copies. To ensure your Profile is not  publicly visible, keep it set to Not Searchable.
What is a Searchable Profile?
Searchable Profiles on Indeed
can be viewed or made  available to anyone accessing our site.
This includes Employers that Indeed believes may be interested in your Profile, users of Indeed’s Resume Search Program or Smart Sourcing, or anyone with access to the URL associated with your searchable Profile. We offer you the option to make your Profile searchable on the Site to help you find a job.
When your
Profile is searchable
on our site, Indeed can  share the contents of your
Profile
, including your name and any other personal data that you may include in it, with anyone accessing  the site. This will include additional information in your
Indeed Profile
about your desired job preferences, such as your desired job schedule and salary, your willingness to relocate, licenses, certifications, skills, and other information you choose to include about your job search. We use this information to help you find a job.
By creating or adding information to your Profile or uploading a file resume on the site, Indeed may share with you Job Ads that match the contents of your Profile. Indeed may also highlight to you items in Your Profile that may match qualifications from the Job Ad, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Ad and may be missing from Your Profile.
It is your responsibility to review your Profile and resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or your Profile to be reflected.
How do I change my profile privacy settings?
When you create or add information to your Profile  on Indeed, it will be set to searchable  by default (“Searchable”).
If you prefer not to have your Profile available to third parties or do not want Employers to contact you, you can set your Indeed Profile and uploaded resume to “not searchable” or “cannot be found” (“Not Searchable”). This can be done by going to your “Profile” page and changing the settings to “not searchable” or “employers can’t find you on Indeed.”
When you adjust your privacy settings  from Searchable to Not Searchable ,
When your Profile is set to Searchable, search engines and other third parties can copy it and make it publicly available elsewhere. Indeed does not control these third parties. If your Profile is copied, changing it to Not Searchable on Indeed will not affect those copies.
. Additionally,
setting your Profile to Not Searchable will not affect your previous applications or stop employers you responded to from contacting or reaching out to you.
Changes made to your Profile  privacy settings may take a few days to complete, during which time a profile  set to searchable , for example, may remain visible to employers and other users searching on Indeed.
If you do not want Indeed to make your Indeed Profile available to third parties or if you do not want employers to contact you, set your Profile to private in your privacy settings.
What are resume review services?
We may also offer additional resume review services to help job seekers build and improve their resumes. For example, this can include helping you understand how your resume may be parsed by applicant tracking system software, feedback on ways to build a more effective resume, or a personalized resume review video. In providing these services, Indeed may give you feedback, including questions and comments on the contents of your resume, about your resume or other materials you submit through the services. We provide this feedback directly to you, and may give you the ability to access it within your account. It is not made available to employers.
Does Indeed comply with international privacy rules?
Indeed takes the privacy of its users very seriously, investing significant resources as part of our efforts to protect your personal data. This includes closely monitoring developments in international privacy rules, and endeavoring to adhere to those rules. We very much value the trust that our jobseekers place in us to help them find jobs, and our employers place in us to help them find great candidates. Our
Privacy Policy
describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect our users’ information.
Where is Indeed’s main establishment for GDPR purposes?
As provided for in Indeed’s
Privacy Policy
, European personal data of our jobseekers and employers is provided to Indeed Ireland Operations Limited (“Indeed Ireland”). Indeed’s main establishment for the purposes of the GDPR is Ireland and our lead supervisory authority is the Irish Data Protection Commission.
What has Indeed done from a privacy perspective to prepare for Brexit?
Indeed has taken measures to ensure the personal data of its users continues to be protected. For example, Indeed has introduced data transfer and processing agreements where appropriate to protect personal data transfers to the United Kingdom in the event of that jurisdiction departing from the European data protection regime.

California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Updated on March 13, 2024
The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
(CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them and the
CCPA regulations
provide guidance on how to implement the law.  This landmark law secures new privacy rights for California consumers, including:
The
right to know
about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared;
The
right to delete
personal information collected from them (with some exceptions);
The
right to opt-out
of the sale or sharing of their personal information including via the
GPC
;
The
right to non-discrimination
for exercising their CCPA rights.
In November of 2020, California voters approved
Proposition 24, the CPRA
, which amended the CCPA and added new additional privacy protections that began on January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, consumers have new rights in addition to those above, such as:
The
right to correct
inaccurate personal information that a business has about them; and
The
right to limit
the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about them.
Businesses
that are subject to the CCPA have several responsibilities, including responding to consumer requests to exercise these rights and giving consumers certain
notices explaining their privacy practices
. The CCPA applies to many businesses, including
data brokers
.
CPRA amends the CCPA; it does not create a separate, new law.  As a result, our office typically refers to the law as “CCPA” or “CCPA, as amended.”

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
These FAQs provide general consumer information about the CCPA and how you can exercise your rights under the CCPA. They are not legal advice, regulatory guidance, or an opinion of the Attorney General. We will update this information periodically.
A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA
1. What rights do I have under the CCPA?
If you are a California resident, you may ask businesses to disclose what personal information they have about you and what they do with that information, to delete your personal information, to direct businesses not to sell or share your personal information, to correct inaccurate information that they have about you, and to limit businesses’ use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information:
Right to know
: You can request that a business disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information they have collected about you, (2) the categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the purposes for which the business uses that information, (4) the categories of third parties with whom the business discloses the information, and (5) the categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties. You can make a request to know up to twice a year, free of charge.
Right to delete
: You can request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and tell their service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep the information).
Right to opt-out of sale or sharing
: You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global privacy control. Businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again.
Right to correct
: You may ask businesses to correct inaccurate information that they have about you.
Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information
: You can direct businesses to only use your sensitive personal information (for example, your social security number, financial account information, your precise geolocation data, or your genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
You also have the right to be notified, before or at the point businesses collect your personal information, of the types of personal information they are collecting and what they may do with that information. Generally, businesses cannot discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Businesses cannot make you waive these rights, and any contract provision that says you waive these rights is unenforceable.
2. What if I am not a California resident?
Only California residents have rights under the CCPA. A California resident is a natural person (as opposed to a corporation or other business entity) who resides in California, even if the person is temporarily outside of the state.
3. What is considered personal information and sensitive personal information under the CCPA?
Personal information
is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with you or your household. For example, it could include your name, social security number, email address, records of products purchased, internet browsing history, geolocation data, fingerprints, and inferences from other personal information that could create a profile about your preferences and characteristics.
Sensitive personal information
is a specific subset of personal information that includes certain government identifiers (such as social security numbers); an account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number with any required security code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; contents of mail, email, and text messages; genetic data; biometric information processed to identify a consumer; information concerning a consumer’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation; or information about racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership. Consumers have the right to also limit a business’s use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.
Personal information does not include publicly available information (including public real estate/property records) and certain
types of information
.
4. What is not considered personal information under the CCPA?
Personal information does not include publicly available information that is from federal, state, or local government records, such as professional licenses and public real estate/property records.  The definition of publicly available information also includes information that a business has a reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public by the consumer or from widely distributed media, or certain information disclosed by a consumer and made available if the consumer has not restricted the information to a specific audience.
The CCPA also exempts certain types of information such as certain medical information and consumer credit reporting information.
5. What businesses does the CCPA apply to?
The CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that do business in California and meet any of the following:
Have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million;
Buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents or households; or
Derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residents’ personal information.
6. Does the CCPA apply to nonprofits or government agencies?
The CCPA generally does not apply to nonprofit organizations or government agencies.
7. What can I do if I think a business violated the CCPA?
You cannot sue businesses for most CCPA violations. You can only sue a business under the CCPA if there is a data breach, and even then, only under limited circumstances. You can sue a business if your nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information was stolen in a data breach as a result of the business’s failure to maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect it. If this happens, you can sue for the amount of monetary damages you actually suffered from the breach or “statutory damages” of up to $750 per incident. Before suing, you must give the business written notice of which CCPA sections it violated and allow 30 days to respond in writing that it has cured the violations and that no further violations will occur. If the business is able to actually cure the violation and gives you its written statement that it has done so, you cannot sue the business, unless it continues to violate the CCPA contrary to its statement.
For all other violations of the CCPA, only the Attorney General or the California Privacy Protection Agency may take legal action against non-compliant entities. The Attorney General does not represent individual California consumers. Using consumer complaints and other information, the Attorney General may identify patterns of misconduct that may lead to investigations and actions on behalf of the collective legal interests of the people of California. If you believe a business has violated the CCPA, you may
file a consumer complaint
with the Office of the Attorney General. If you choose to file a complaint with our office, explain exactly how the business violated the CCPA, and describe when and how the violation occurred. Please note that the Attorney General cannot represent you or give you legal advice on how to resolve your individual complaint.  Starting on July 1, 2023, you also will be able to file complaints with the
California Privacy Protection Agency
for violations of the CCPA, as amended, occurring on or after that date.
8. What kind of data breach can I sue a business for under the CCPA?
You can only sue businesses under the CCPA if certain conditions are met. The type of personal information that must have been stolen is your first name (or first initial) and last name in combination with any of the following:
Your social security number
Your driver’s license number, tax identification number, passport number, military identification number, or other unique identification number issued on a government document commonly used to identify a person's identity
Your financial account number, credit card number, or debit card number if combined with any required security code, access code, or password that would allow someone access to your account
Your medical or health insurance information
Your fingerprint, retina or iris image, or other unique biometric data used to identify a person's identity (but not including photographs unless used or stored for facial recognition purposes)
This personal information must have been stolen in nonencrypted and nonredacted form. In addition, the personal information must have been stolen in a data breach as a result of the business’s failure to maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect it. If this happens, you can sue for the amount of monetary damages you actually suffered from the breach or “statutory damages” of up to $750 per incident. Before suing, you must give the business written notice of which CCPA sections it violated and allow 30 days to respond in writing that it has cured the violations and that no further violations will occur. If the business is able to actually cure the violation and gives you its written statement that it has done so, you cannot sue the business, unless it continues to violate the CCPA contrary to its statement.
9. Do businesses need to comply with the statutory CPRA amendments to the CCPA that went into effect on January 1, 2023?
Yes. As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA are in effect, and businesses are required to comply with all express statutory requirements. Businesses are also required to comply with those CCPA regulations currently in effect.
10. Are there any CCPA regulations currently in effect?
Yes. The California Department of Justice promulgated an initial round of regulations implementing the CCPA on August 14, 2020 and further amended on March 15, 2021. Those regulations were recently updated by the California Privacy Protection Agency. These regulations appear in
Title 11, Division 6, Section 7001 et seq. of the California Code of Regulations
and were effective on March 29, 2023.
11. Are the statutory exemptions for employee data and business-to-business transactions still in effect?
No. The exemptions for employment-related personal information and personal information reflecting business-to-business transactions described in Civil Code Sec. 1798.145(m)-(n) expired on December 31, 2022.
12. Can I use an authorized agent to submit a request?
Yes.  You may authorize another person to submit a CCPA request on your behalf.  You may also authorize a business entity registered with the California Secretary of State to submit a request on your behalf.
Please note that if you use an authorized agent, businesses may require more information from either the authorized agent or from you to verify that you are the person directing the agent.  For example, for requests to know or delete your personal information, the business may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave that agent signed permission to submit the request.  Businesses may also require you to verify your identity directly with the business or directly confirm with the business that you gave the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

B. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF SALE OR SHARING
1. What is the right to opt-out?
You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (“opt-out”).  Note that sharing refers specifically to sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising, which is the targeting of advertising to a
consumer
based on the
consumer
’s
personal information
obtained from the
consumer
’s online activity across numerous websites. With some exceptions, businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later provide authorization allowing them to do so again. Businesses must wait at least 12 months before asking you to opt back in to the sale or sharing of your personal information.
2. Can businesses sell a child’s personal information?
Businesses can only sell the personal information of a child that they know to be under the age of 16 if they get affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) for the sale of the child’s personal information. For children under the age of 13, that opt-in must come from the child’s parent or guardian. For children who are at least 13 years old but under the age of 16, the opt-in can come from the child.
3. How do I submit my opt-out request?
Businesses that sell personal information are subject to the CCPA's requirement to provide a clear and conspicuous “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on their website that allows you to submit an opt-out request. Businesses cannot require you to create an account in order to submit your request. Businesses also should not require you to verify your identity, though they can ask you basic questions to identify which personal information is associated with you.
You can also submit an opt-out request via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the GPC, discussed in FAQ 8 & 9 below. If you can’t find a business’s “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link, review its privacy policy to see if it sells or shares personal information. If the business does, it must also include that link in its privacy policy.
If a business’s "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link or other designated method of submitting opt-out requests is not working or difficult to find, you may report the business to our office (
https://oag.ca.gov/contact/consumer-complaint-against-business-or-company
).
4. How long does the business have to respond to my opt-out request?
Businesses must respond as soon as feasibly possible to your request, up to a maximum of 15 business days from the date they received your request to opt-out.
5. Why is the business asking me for more information?
While businesses are not required to verify that the person submitting an opt-out request is really the consumer for whom the business has personal information, they may need to ask you for additional information to make sure they stop selling the right person’s personal information. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
6. Why did the business deny my opt-out request?
There are some exceptions to the opt-out right. Common reasons why businesses may refuse to stop selling your personal information include:
Sale or sharing is necessary for the business to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
The information is publicly available information, certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA.
See
Civil Code section 1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your opt-out request, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
7. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.
The CCPA treats service providers differently than the businesses they serve. It is the business that is responsible for responding to consumer requests.  If you submit a request to opt-out to a service provider of a business instead of the business itself, the service provider may deny the request. You must submit your request to the business itself.
If a service provider has said that it does not or cannot act on your request because it is a service provider, you may follow up to ask who the business is. However, sometimes the service provider will not be able to provide that information. You may be able to determine who the business is based on the services that the service provider provides, although sometimes this may be difficult or impossible.
8. What is the GPC?
Businesses that sell or share personal information must offer two or more methods for consumers to submit requests to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. For businesses that collect personal information from consumers online, one acceptable method for consumers to opt-out of sales or sharing is via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the
GPC
.  Developed in response to the CCPA and to enhance consumer privacy rights, the GPC is a ‘stop selling or sharing my data switch’ that is available on some internet browsers, like Mozilla Firefox, Duck Duck Go, and Brave, or as a browser extension. It is a proposed technical standard that reflects what the CCPA regulations contemplated – some consumers want a comprehensive option that broadly signals their opt-out request, as opposed to making requests on multiple websites on different browsers or devices. Opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information should be easy for consumers, and the GPC is one option for consumers who want to submit requests to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information via a user-enabled global privacy control. Under law, it must be honored by covered businesses as a valid consumer request to stop the sale or sharing of personal information.

9. How do I submit my opt-out request using the GPC?
To learn more about the GPC, you can visit its website
here
.  Developers have begun to innovate around the GPC and created different mechanisms for consumers, such as EFF’s
Privacy Badger
extension or the Brave Privacy Browser.

C. REQUESTS TO KNOW
1. What is the right to know?
You may request that businesses disclose to you what personal information they have collected, used, shared, or sold about you, and why they collected, used, shared, or sold that information. Specifically, you may request that businesses disclose:
The categories of personal information collected
Specific pieces of personal information collected
The categories of sources from which the business collected personal information
The purposes for which the business uses the personal information
The categories of third parties with whom the business shares the personal information
The categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties
Businesses must provide you this information for the 12-month period preceding your request. They must provide this information to you free of charge.
2. How do I submit my request to know?
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, an email address, website form, or hard copy form. One of those methods has to be a toll-free phone number and, if the business has a website, one of those methods has to be through its website. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests to know.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a request to know, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your request to know through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information. If you can’t find a business’s designated methods, review its privacy policy, which must include instructions on how you can submit your request.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to know is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to know?
Businesses must respond to your request within 45 calendar days. They can extend that deadline by another 45 days (90 days total) if they notify you.
If you submitted a request to know and have not received any response within the timeline, check the business’s privacy policy to make sure you submitted your request through the designated way. Follow up with the business to see if the business is subject to the CCPA and to follow up on your request.
4. Why is the business asking me for more information?
Businesses must verify that the person making a request to know is the consumer about whom the business has personal information. Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to know?
There are some exceptions to the right to know. Common reasons why businesses may refuse to disclose your personal information include:
The business cannot verify your request
The request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or the business has already provided personal information to you more than twice in a 12-month period
Businesses cannot disclose certain sensitive information, such as your social security number, financial account number, or account passwords, but they must tell you if they’re collecting that type of information
Disclosure would restrict the business’s ability to comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
If the personal information is certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
See
Civil Code section 1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your request to know, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
6. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.

D. REQUESTS TO DELETE
1. What is my right to delete personal information?
You may request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and to tell their service providers to do the same. However, there are
many exceptions
(see FAQ D.5) that allow businesses to keep your personal information.
2. How do I submit my right to delete?
Review the business’s privacy policy, which must include instructions on how you can submit your request to delete.
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, a toll-free number, email address, website form, or hard copy form. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a deletion request, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your deletion request through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to delete is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to delete?

Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to delete?
There are exceptions to the right to delete. Common reasons why businesses may keep your personal information include:
If the information is exempt from the CCPA.  This includes:
Publicly available information (such as your address, which is often in public real estate/property records)
.  However, if you are a law enforcement officer, public official, or Safe at Home participant (available to victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, elder and dependent abuse, as well as reproductive health workers), you may request a website to not publicly post your address as described
here
.
Certain
types of information
such as medical information or consumer credit reporting information.
The business cannot verify your request
To complete your transaction, provide a reasonably anticipated product or service, or for certain warranty and product recall purposes
For certain business security practices
For certain internal uses that are compatible with reasonable consumer expectations or the context in which the information was provided
To comply with legal obligations, exercise legal claims or rights, or defend legal claims
If the personal information is certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
See
Civil Code sections 1798.105(d)
and
1798.145
for more exceptions.
If you do not know why a business denied your request to delete, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.
6. Why did I get a response that the business is a service provider that does not have to act on my request?
Many businesses use other businesses to provide services for them. For example, a retailer may contract with a payment card processor to process customer credit card transactions or a shipping company to deliver orders. These entities may qualify as “service providers” under the CCPA.

You may be able to determine who the business is based on the services that the service provider provides, although sometimes this may be difficult or impossible.
7. Why is a debt collector still calling me about my debt even though I asked it to delete my information?
Creditors, collection agencies, and other debt collectors can still try to collect debts that you owe even if you asked them to delete your personal information. Learn more about debt collectors—including what they can and can’t do—

E. REQUESTS TO CORRECT 
 (RIGHT TO CORRECT)
1. What is the right to correct?
You may ask businesses to correct inaccurate information that they have about you.
The California Privacy Protection Agency is currently engaged in a formal rulemaking process and has
proposed CCPA regulations pertaining to the right to correct
, but these are not currently final or effective.
2.  How do I submit my request to correct?
Review the business’s privacy policy, which should include instructions on how you can submit your request to correct.
Businesses must designate at least two methods for you to submit your request—for example, a toll-free number, email address, website form, or hard copy form. However, if a business operates exclusively online, it only needs to provide an email address for submitting requests.
Businesses cannot make you create an account just to submit a correction request, but if you already have an account with the business, it may require you to submit your request through that account.
Make sure you submit your correction request through one of the business’s designated methods, which may be different from its normal customer service contact information.
If a business’s designated method of submitting requests to correct is not working, notify the business in writing and consider submitting your request through another designated method if possible.
3. How long does the business have to respond to my request to correct?
Businesses must respond to your request within 45 calendar days. They can extend that deadline by another 45 days (90 days total) if they notify you.
If you submitted a request to correct and have not received any response within the timeline, check the business’s privacy policy to make sure you submitted your request through the designated way. Follow up with the business to see if the business is subject to the CCPA and to follow up on your request.
4. Why is the business asking me for more information?
Businesses must verify that the person making a request to correct is the consumer about whom the business has personal information. Businesses may need to ask you for additional information for verification purposes. If the business asks for personal information to verify your identity, it can only use that information for this verification purpose.
5. Why did the business deny my request to correct?
There are exceptions to the right to correct. Common reasons why businesses may deny your request to correct include:
The business cannot verify your identity to complete your request
The request is manifestly unfounded or excessive
The information is publicly available information, certain medical information, consumer credit reporting information, or other types of information exempt from the CCPA
If you do not know why a business denied your request to correct, follow up with the business to ask it for its reasons.

F. REQUESTS TO LIMIT USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION (RIGHT TO LIMIT)
1. What is the right to limit?
You can direct businesses to only use your sensitive personal information (for example, your social security number, financial account information, your precise geolocation data, or your genetic data) for limited purposes, such as providing you with the services you requested.
The California Privacy Protection Agency is currently engaged in a formal rulemaking process and has
proposed CCPA regulations pertaining to the right to limit
, but these are not currently final or effective.
Back To Top
G. RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION
Businesses cannot deny goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to a business or ask it to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for the business to provide you with goods or services, the business may not be able to complete that transaction.
Businesses can also offer you promotions, discounts and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information. But they can only do this if the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information. If you ask a business to delete or stop selling your personal information, you may not be able to continue participating in the special deals they offer in exchange for personal information. If you are not sure how your request may affect your participation in a special offer, ask the business.

H. REQUIRED NOTICES
1. What is a notice at collection?
The CCPA requires businesses to give consumers certain information in a “notice at collection.” A notice at collection must list the categories of personal information businesses collect about consumers and the purposes for which they use the categories of information. (To find out how you can learn what specific information a business has collected about you, see the
Right to Know section
.)  If the business sells consumers’ personal information, then the notice at collection must include a
Do Not Sell or Share link
. The notice must also contain a link to the business’s privacy policy, where consumers can get a fuller description of the business’s privacy practices and of their privacy rights.
2. Where can I find a business’s notice at collection?
This notice must be provided
at or before
the point at which the business collects your personal information. For example, you might find a link to the notice at collection on a website’s homepage and on a webpage where you place an order or enter your personal information for another reason. On a mobile app, you might find a link to the notice in the settings menu. In a retail store, you might find the notice on a printed form used to collect your personal information.
3. What is a privacy policy?
A business’s privacy policy is a written statement that gives a broad picture of its online and offline practices for the collection, use, sharing, and sale of consumers’ personal information. The CCPA requires business privacy policies to include information on consumers’ privacy rights and how to exercise them: the
Right to Know
, the
Right to Delete
, the
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
, the
the Right to Correct
, the
the Right to Limit
, and the
Right to Non-Discrimination

4. Where can I find a business’s privacy policy?
Most businesses post their privacy policy on their websites. A link to it can usually be found at the bottom of the homepage and other webpages. The link’s title may include “Privacy” or “California Privacy Rights.” In a mobile app, the privacy policy may be linked on the download page for the app or in the app’s settings menu.

I. DATA BROKERS AND THE CCPA
1. What is a data broker?
Another California law,
Civil Code section 1798.99.80
, defines a data broker as “a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.” This law exempts certain businesses that are regulated by other laws from this definition. Exempted businesses include consumer reporting agencies (commonly known as credit bureaus) and certain financial institutions and insurance companies.
Data brokers collect information about consumers from many sources including websites, other businesses, and public records. The data broker analyzes and packages the data for sale to other businesses.
2. How can I find data brokers that collect and sell my personal information?
The
California law on data brokers
requires data brokers covered by the law to register with the Attorney General and to provide certain information on their practices. The Data Broker Registry can be found on the Attorney General’s website at
https://oag.ca.gov/data-brokers
.
Data brokers are subject to the CCPA. On the Data Broker Registry website, you will find contact information and a website link for each registered data broker, as well as additional information to help you exercise your CCPA rights.
3. How can I stop a data broker from selling my personal information?
You can click on the “View Full Submission” link on the
Data Broker Registry
to get instructions on how to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. However, you may not be able to stop the sale of all of your information. The CCPA’s definition of “personal information” does not include information lawfully made available from government records, which are often sources used by data brokers.
You can also go to a data broker’s website through the link posted on the Registry and find the broker’s privacy policy to learn more about its privacy practices and how to exercise your CCPA rights.

Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)
CPA Information
On July 7, 2021, Governor Polis signed Senate Bill 21-190: Protect Personal Data Privacy establishing the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA). The CPA tasked the Colorado Attorney General with implementing and enforcing the CPA, including adopting new rules. The CPA is a part of the State of Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act and went into effect July 1, 2023.
The CPA grants Colorado Consumers new rights with respect to their personal data, including the right to access, delete, and correct their personal data as well as the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data or its use for targeted advertising or certain kinds of profiling. The CPA also places new obligations on covered entities to safeguard personal data, including the requirement to give Coloradans meaningful information about the collection and use of their data, to conduct data protection assessments, and to obtain consent before processing certain sensitive personal data.
The proposed draft rules for the CPA were
published by the Secretary of State
on Oct. 10, 2022, and the
final rules
were filed with the Secretary of State March 15, 2023. These include the required rules that detail the technical specifications for one or more universal opt-out mechanisms that clearly communicate a consumer’s affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt out of the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising or the sale of personal data (6-1-1313(2), C.R.S.).

CPA Enforcement
On July 12, 2023, Attorney General Weiser
announced
the launch of enforcement of the CPA. As part of that enforcement effort, the Department began mailing letters to businesses focused on educating them about the law and their new legal obligations. You can read examples of those letters here:
Notice of Application Letter Example 1
Notice of Application Letter Example 2
Notice of Application Letter Example 3
Frequently Asked Questions and General Information
The CPA protects the personal data of Colorado residents when they act in an individual or household context, for example when browsing the internet or signing up for a retail rewards program. The CPA does not cover the personal data of individuals acting in a commercial or employment context, such as a job applicant
To allow companies time to change their practices and operations to comply with this new law, it will not take effect until July 1, 2023.
Under the act, Colorado consumers will gain additional insight into what personal data controllers collect, share and sell, and how that data is used. Additionally, Colorado consumers will have the following enumerated rights with respect to their personal data:
The right to opt-out from the sale of their personal data, or use of personal data for targeted advertising and certain types of profiling;
The right to know whether a controller is collecting personal data;
The right to access personal data that a controller has collected about them;
The right to correct personal data;
The right to delete personal data; and
The right to download and remove personal data from a platform in a format that allows the transfer to another platform.
Data processing refers to actions a company make take regarding personal data, including the collection, usage, sale, storage, disclosure, analysis, deletion, or modification of personal data. An entity “processes” data even if it instructs another entity to process data on its behalf.
A controller determines the purpose for and means of collecting and processing personal data.​ For example, retailers like Walmart and Target are considered controllers because they collect consumer information when customers make their purchases, and then decide how that information will be used. Controllers make the primary decisions to manage, collect, and utilize data.
A processor maintains and processes consumer personal data on behalf of a controller. For example, a cloud services provider could act as a processor by storing personal data collected by a controller, as directed by that controller.
The general distinguishing factor between a processor and a controller is the entity’s autonomy and decision-making authority over data. Under the CPA, a processor may only process data under the direct authorization and command of a controller. The CPA requires a controller and processor to define their respective responsibilities and obligations in a contractually binding processing agreement.
Some processors act as both controllers and processors depending on their role, and if  a Processor begins to determine the purpose and means of the data processing, it becomes a controller with respect to that processing.
“Personal Data” for purposes of the CPA’s application thresholds includes all information that is linked or could reasonably be linked to a Consumer, which is defined as a Colorado resident acting in an individual or household context (as opposed to an employment or business-to-business context). For instance, “Personal Data” does not include information collected from a job applicant. "Personal data" also does not include information made publicly available by federal, state, or local government, or made publicly available by the consumer.
The CPA defines "Consumer" as "an individual who is a Colorado resident acting only in an individual or household context..." C.R.S. § 6-1-1303(6).
Therefore, when the CPA states that it applies to a Controller that "Controls or Processes the Personal Data of one hundred thousand Consumers or more during the calendar year," it means 100,000 Colorado residents.
The CPA does not apply to data maintained for employment records purposes. Furthermore, the term "consumer" means an individual Colorado resident acting only in an individual or household context and does not include an individual acting as an employee or job applicant.
Data controllers will be required to accept opt-out requests through universal opt-out mechanisms starting on July 1, 2024. Prior to July 1, 2024, controllers may, but are not required to, allow consumers to opt-out of personal data processing through a universal opt-out mechanism. By January 1, 2024, the Colorado Department of Law will publish a list of universal opt-out mechanisms that have been recognized meet the standards of the Colorado Privacy Act.
For information regarding a specific controller, check the controller's privacy notice. Each controller's privacy notice must include a description of the various methods through which a consumer can exercise their data rights. Starting, July 1, 2024, these notices must include an explanation of how opt-out requests through universal opt-out mechanisms will be processed.
What Consumers and Entities should know
How do Colorado consumers exercise their rights under the CPA?
When the CPA goes into effect in July of 2023, consumers will be able to learn how to exercise their rights on businesses’ websites. Businesses and other organizations controlling data, also called controllers, will be obligated to provide consumers with a privacy notice that includes the types of personal data collected or processed, the purpose for which that personal data is processed, the type of data that is shared with third parties and the categories of third parties it is shared with, and how people can access, correct, delete, and download and transmit their personal data. Additionally, those businesses and organizations will have to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure if any personal data is sold or processed for targeted advertising and how people can to opt out of having their data sold or processed. Consumers will be able to opt-out through businesses' privacy notices as well as through a readily accessible location outside the privacy notice. Additionally, consumers will be able to opt out through a universal opt-out option which will apply to all businesses subject to the CPA.
Before the CPA goes into effect, the Colorado Attorney General’s Office will create and provide rules with input from consumers and other stakeholders setting forth additional details regarding the steps controllers must take to ensure that consumers can effectively exercise their rights, including details relating to the universal opt-out mechanism.
Only in specific circumstances. The CPA requires controllers to get affirmative consent from consumers prior to (1) collecting and processing sensitive data, (2) processing personal data for reasons other than those specified when the data was collected, or (3) selling or processing personal data for targeted advertising after a consumer has opted out of such uses. Such consent must be affirmative, freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Acceptance of broad terms of service, hovering over, pausing, or otherwise interacting with content generally, and agreement obtained through deceptive webpage design is not considered consent under the CPA.
Personal data is any non-public information that reasonably can be linked to an individual. Sensitive data is a subset of personal data and includes:
Any personal data regarding a child under the age of 13;
Any data that reveals the race, ethnic origin, or religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual activity, preferences or orientation, or citizenship status or citizenship of an individual; and
Biometric data that is used for identifying an individual.
The Colorado Privacy Act requires that consumer disclosures are understandable and accessible. Data controllers shall use plain, straightforward language and provide communications in languages generally used by the business. Communications must be “provided in a readable format on all devices through which consumer normally or regularly interact with the controller, including on smaller screens and through mobile applications, if applicable.” 4 CCR 904-3, Rule 3.01(5). In considering whether disclosures must be provided in a readable format on a specific device, controllers should consider whether the consumer receives other communications, disclosures and notifications from the controller on that device in the normal course of business.
Notifications and disclosures must also be reasonably accessible to consumers with disabilities by following standard web accessibility guidelines and by providing information on how customers with disabilities may access the communication or request it in an alternative format.
Data controllers must respond to consumer requests within 45 days of receiving the request. If reasonably necessary, a controller may extend this period by an additional 45 days, though the controller must inform the consumer of the extension within the original 45-day period and provide reasons for delay.
Under the CPA, consumers have the right to access their personal data collected and maintained by the controller. Consumers also have a right to obtain this data in a portable and readily usable format. Controllers must provide information to consumers free of charge for the first request within a twelve-month period. Controllers may charge for second or subsequent requests within a twelve-month period, at a rate of 25 cents per page or no more than the actual cost of the record requested.
Controllers must comply with access requests by providing all the specific pieces of personal data collected about the consumer, with few exceptions for passwords, identification numbers, or financial data. Responses to access requests must be concise, transparent, and intelligible, and in a commonly used format. For full details, see 4 CCR 904-3, Rule 4.04.
If a consumer requests this data in a portable format, the controller must transfer the personal data securely in a common electronic format which is readily usable by another entity. However, a controller is not required to provide data in a manner which would disclose trade secrets. For full details, see 4 CCR 904-3, Rule 4.07.
The Colorado Privacy Act gives Colorado Consumers specific rights, including the Right of access. In describing the right of access, the CPA states that "[a] Consumer has the right to confirm whether a Controller is Processing Personal Data Concerning the Consumer and to access the Consumer's Personal Data.” C.R.S. § 6-1-1306(1)(b).
"Consumer" under the CPA means "(a) an individual who is a Colorado resident acting only in an individual or household context; and (b) does not include an individual acting in a commercial or employment context, as a job applicant, or as a beneficiary of someone acting in an employment context. C.R.S. § 6-1-1303(6).
Therefore, the right of access enables a Colorado resident acting in an individual context to access their own Personal Data and does not give a third party (e.g. an employer or landlord) the right to request a Consumer's Personal Data.
Methods for consumers to opt-out or make requests to the controller should consider the ways that consumers normally interact with the controller. Exclusively online companies that interact directly with consumers need only provide an email address for submitting requests. Controllers with a website or mobile app that also interact with consumers offline should have one method such as a webform on that website or app, and another method as well. Controllers with an in-person presence should consider offline methods like printed forms, in-store tablets, or telephone options. Whichever methods a controller chooses, the process must be available at any time, must be easy to execute, and must require a minimal number of steps.
A "Bona Fide Loyalty Programs", as referred to in the CPA, "is defined as a loyalty, rewards, premium feature, discount, or club card program established for the genuine purpose of providing Bona Fide Loyalty Program Benefits to Consumers that voluntarily participate in that program such that the primary purpose of Processing Personal Data through the program is solely to provide Bona Fide Loyalty Program Benefits to participating Consumers." 4 CCR 904-3, Rule 2.02.
A "Bona Fide Loyalty Program Benefit" is "an offer of superior price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services provided to a Consumer through a Bona Fide Loyalty Program." 4 CCR 904-3, Rule 2.02.
The Sale of Personal Data or use of Personal Data for Targeted Advertising is not a Bona Fide Loyalty Program Benefit and therefore not the primary purpose of a Bona Fide Loyalty Program. Instead, it is a secondary use. Under the CPA, a Controller must obtain Consent from a Consumer before Processing the Consumer's Personal Data for a secondary use. Accordingly, a Controller must obtain Consent to use Personal Data obtained through a Bona Fide Loyalty Program for Targeted Advertising.
How Businesses, Nonprofits, and other entities will be impacted
The law applies to entities, including nonprofits, that conduct business in Colorado or deliver commercial products or services targeted to residents of Colorado;
AND
either:
Process the personal data of more than 100,000 individuals in any calendar year; or
Derive revenue or receive discounts on goods or services in exchange for the sale of personal data of 25,000 or more individuals.
The law also applies to service providers, contractors, and vendors that manage, maintain, or provide services relating to the data on behalf of these companies.
The CPA excludes some types of entities from complying with its requirements. These entities include:
Financial institutions and affiliates subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;
Air carriers subject to Federal Aviation Administration regulation; and
National securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act.
The CPA also does not apply to certain types of personal data maintained in compliance with specific federal privacy laws, such the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or for certain governmental purposes. For a complete list see §6-1-1304 of the CPA.
Under the law, controllers
MUST
:
Be transparent
about how they collect, store, use, share and sell personal data, and clearly identify the purpose for which they do so;
Minimize
the amount of data they collect and store, meaning they should only collect and store information they need;
Avoid secondary uses
of the data, meaning they can’t use personal data for reasons individuals were not originally aware of;
Use reasonable security practices
to secure the data;
Respond to requests by individuals
asserting the rights granted to them under the law; and
Conduct Data Protection Assessments
before selling personal data, processing “sensitive data,” or processing personal data that could result in:
unfair, deceptive or disparate treatment of individuals;
financial or physical injury to individuals;
a physical or other intrusion on an individual’s privacy that would be offensive to reasonable people; or
some other substantial injury.
Under the law, controllers
MAY NOT
:
Collect, store, use, share or sell “sensitive data”
without
an individual’s
consent
.
Use personal data in any way that would result in unlawful discrimination.
The obligations of controllers under the CPA are the same whether the personal data is collected offline, such as in-store or over the phone, or online, such as on a website.
Two key obligations for controllers are the duty of transparency via clear and accessible privacy notices and the duty to respond to consumers who wish to exercise their rights under the CPA. Other obligations include: a duty to minimize unnecessary data collection and avoid secondary use, a duty of care in processing data, a duty to avoid unlawful discrimination, and a duty to obtain consent before processing sensitive data. For more information on specific requirements for data controllers, please see 4 CCR 904-3, Part 6.
Both controllers and processors have responsibilities under the CPA. A controller is a person or entity who determines the purposes for and means of processing personal data. Controller responsibilities are outlined throughout the CPA, and include those duties listed in C.R.S. § 6-1-1308, as well as the obligation to provide consumers with a clear and conspicuous opt-out method and to respond to consumers’ request to exercise their rights under the C.R.S. § 6-1-1306(2).
A processor is a person or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller. Processors must adhere to instructions of the controller and assist the controller to meet its obligations under the CPA. Processors must also ensure the confidentiality of anyone processing personal data and take measures to allow for the fulfillment of consumer data requests. Full processor responsibilities are outlined in C.R.S. § 6-1-1305(2)-(6).
It is possible that a covered entity could be both a controller and processor. In those cases, any personal data collected by the entity for which they determine and control the processing purposes would be subject to controller obligations. Any personal data they receive from a third-party and only handle as a processor would be subject to processor obligations.
Both controllers and processors are responsible for entering into a contract governing the processing relationship and for implementing appropriate measures to ensure an appropriate level of security with established allocations of responsibilities.
How the CPA will be enforced
The Attorney General’s Office and District Attorneys have sole enforcement power under the CPA. The Attorney General’s Office also has rulemaking authority under the law.
No. Private citizens are not entitled to file lawsuits or enforce legal rights under the CPA. Only the Attorney General and District Attorneys can enforce the CPA.
If the Attorney General or District Attorney determines that a violation can be remedied, the Attorney General or District Attorney must first send a letter giving the violator 60 days to cure the violation. If either office determines that no fix is possible for the violation, no such letter is required. The process of providing notice of a violation and allowing 60 days for a cure will be in effect until Jan. 1, 2025.
Yes. The Attorney General will create rules both for the purpose of carrying out the CPA and to detail the technical specifications of one or more universal opt-out options. The Attorney General plans on adopting those rules before July 1, 2023.
The Attorney General’s Office will engage with Colorado consumers, businesses, and other stakeholders related to the CPA and potential rulemaking considerations. In early 2022, the Attorney General’s Office will post a series of topics for informal input on its website and solicit responses in writing and at scheduled events. This will help the office engage in a more focused dialogue, consider diverse perspectives, and address issues. By the fall of 2022, the Attorney General’s Office plans to post a formal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which will include a proposed set of model rules. This will kick off a process of collecting verbal and written comments about the proposed rules and how they would operate from a range of stakeholders and other interested persons across Colorado.

The Colorado Privacy Act applies to data controllers that conduct business in Colorado or whose products or services are targeted at Colorado residents, and that either process the personal data of at least 100,000 Colorado consumers in one calendar year, or that derive revenue or receive a discount on the price of goods or services from the sale of personal data and process or control the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers. The Act applies regardless of the controller's location and enforcement will not vary based on a controller’s location.
2024 Rulemaking
On September 13, 2024 the Department of Law filed a set of proposed draft amendments to the CPA rules to create a process of issuing opinion letters and interpretive guidance, and to modify current language to be consistent with the CPA as amended by recent legislation.
The Department sought public comment and held a public hearing on the proposed draft amendments. After revising the proposed draft amendments based on stakeholder comments, the Department has now adopted those rules and requested a formal Attorney General opinion.

The Connecticut Data Privacy Act
On May 10, 2022, Governor Ned Lamont signed Senate Bill 6: An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (also known as The Connecticut Data Privacy Act or “CTDPA”), making Connecticut one of the first states to pass a comprehensive consumer privacy law. The CTDPA gives important data rights to Connecticut residents and solidifies privacy obligations for businesses. As of January 1, 2025, businesses covered under the CTDPA must honor universal opt out preference signals sent by Connecticut residents.
CTDPA Universal Opt Out Resources
CTDPA FAQs
The following are answers to Frequently Asked Questions regarding consumers’ rights and businesses’ obligations under the CTDPA. Please note that this does not constitute legal advice or an opinion from the Attorney General.
When Does the Act take Effect?
The CTDPA takes effect on July 1, 2023.
What Does the Act Do?
The CTDPA gives Connecticut residents certain rights over their personal data and establishes responsibilities and privacy protection standards for data controllers that process personal data. It protects a Connecticut resident acting in an individual or household context, such as browsing the Internet or making a purchase at a store. It does not protect an individual acting in an employment context, such as applying for a job.
What Does the Act Apply to?
The CTDPA applies to people who conduct business in Connecticut or who produce products or services targeted to Connecticut residents and that, during the prior calendar year, controlled or processed the personal data of:
at least 100,000 consumers; or
25,000 or more consumers and derived over 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.
However, the CTDPA applies to all Consumer Health Data Controllers who do business in Connecticut, regardless of their size or the nature of their data processing activities (see below section regarding Consumer Health Data Controllers).
The CTDPA also applies to service providers (called “processors”) that maintain or provide services involving personal data on behalf of covered businesses.
What is a Controller?
A controller is defined as an individual or legal entity that, independently or jointly with others, collects and processes personal data and is responsible for responding to consumer requests about the collection and processing of personal data.
What is the Difference Between a Controller and a Processor?
The key distinction between a controller and a processor is their decision-making authority over personal data. Under the CTDPA, a processor may only process data at the request and under the direction of a controller. The processor is contractually bound by the controller’s instructions as to what the processor must and may do with personal data.
If a processor were to begin exercising decision-making authority with respect to the purposes and means of personal data processing, it would become a controller with respect to that processing and subject to the obligations imposed on controllers under the CTDPA.
What is a Consumer Health Data Controller?
A Consumer Health Data Controller is a controller that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing Consumer Health Data.
What Consumer Health Data Controllers are covered by the CTDPA?
The CTDPA applies to all Consumer Health Data Controllers who conduct business in CT or who produce products or services targeted to Connecticut residents. Unlike other types of controllers, there are no revenue or processing thresholds that a Consumer Health Data Controller must meet for the law to apply.
If a Consumer Health Data Controller is a nonprofit is it exempt from complying with the CTDPA
No. The non-profit exemption does not apply to Consumer Health Data Controllers.
What are some examples of conduct that Consumer Health Data Controllers are prohibited from engaging in under the CTDPA?
Providing employees or contractors with access to Consumer Health Data unless they are required to keep the data confidential;
Providing any processor with Consumer Health Data without having a written contract in place that requires the processor to comply with the CTDPA, including keeping the data confidential;
Using a geofence to establish a virtual boundary around a mental health, reproductive, or sexual health facility for the purpose of processing Consumer Health Data; and
Selling, or offering to sell, Consumer Health Data without first obtaining the consumer’s consent.
What is Personal Data?
Personal data is any information that can be linked to an identifiable individual, excluding publicly available information. Some examples of personal data include: a home address, a driver’s license or state identification number, passport information, a financial account number, login credentials, and payment card information.
What is the Difference Between Personal Data and Sensitive Data?
Sensitive data is a subset of personal data that includes:
Any data revealing racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexual activity or orientation, citizenship, or immigration status;
Consumer Health Data – which means data used to identify a consumer’s physical or mental health condition or diagnosis, and includes, but is not limited to, gender-affirming health data and reproductive health data;
Genetic or biometric data used to uniquely identify an individual;
Personal data of a child under the age of 13; and
Information that identifies an individual’s specific location with a defined degree of precision and accuracy (called “precise geolocation data”).
Under the CTDPA, a controller needs a consumer’s consent to process sensitive data.
What Does it Mean to "Process" Data?
Processing refers to any action a business may take with respect to personal data, including collecting, using, storing, selling, sharing, analyzing, or modifying the data.
Who is Exempt from Complying with the Act?
The following entities are exempt from the CTDPA:
State and local governments
Nonprofit organizations (although nonprofit organizations are not exempt from the CTDPA provisions relating to Consumer Health Data)
Financial institutions subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”)
National securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Entities subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”)
Higher education institutions
The CTDPA also does not apply to certain types of personal data maintained in compliance with other laws, such as the GLBA, HIPAA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as well as personal data processed for certain specified purposes. For a complete list, see Section 3(b) of the CTDPA.
What Rights can Connecticut Residents Exercise under the CTDPA?
The CTDPA provides Connecticut residents the following enumerated rights:
The right to access
personal data that a controller has collected about them.
The right to correct
inaccuracies in their personal data.
The right to delete
their personal data, including personal data that a controller collected through third parties.
The right to obtain
a copy of their personal data in a portable and readily usable format that allows them to transfer the data to another controller with ease.
The right to opt-out
of:
the sale of their personal data;
the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; and
profiling that may have a legal or other significant impact.
How Does a Consumer Know Whether a Controller Processes the Consumer's Data?
A consumer may directly contact the controller—through the channel(s) described in the controller’s required privacy notice—and request that it confirm whether it processes the consumer’s personal data.
How Does a Consumer Exercise Rights Under the CTDPA?
A controller’s privacy notice must clearly describe how consumers may exercise their rights under the CTDPA. Among other methods, a controller must provide an easily accessible link on its website through which consumers can opt-out of targeted advertising or the sale of their personal data.
Also, as of January 1, 2025, consumers may send an opt out preference signal like the
Global Privacy Control
through a
privacy protective browser or browser extension
.
What is an opt out preference signal?
An opt out preference signal is a simple way to tell websites that you don’t want your personal information to be sold or used for targeted advertising, typically through a
privacy protective browser or browser extension
.
I am a Consumer; can I send an Opt Out Preference Signal?
Yes. As of January 1, 2025, Connecticut consumers can send an opt out preference signal, through a variety of platforms, to automatically tell all controllers that they intent to opt out of targeted advertising and the sale of their personal data. Your “signal” can be sent by using, for example, the
Global Privacy Control
through a
privacy protective browser or browser extension
.
Do all Controllers need to Honor Opt Out Preference Signals?
Yes. Starting January 1, 2025, all controllers subject to the CTDPA must honor opt out preference signals that are sent by consumers. This signal must be sent from a platform or mechanism that enables a controller to accurately determine whether the consumer is a Connecticut resident.
If a consumers opt out preference signal conflicts with their previously given privacy choice or their voluntary participation in that controller’s loyalty rewards or discount program, the controller must still comply with the opt out preference signal. The controller may notify the consumer of the conflicting signals and ask the consumer to confirm their choice with the understanding that it would affect their previously given privacy choice or participation in that controller’s loyalty rewards or discount program.
Can a Consumer Opt-Out of the sale of Personal Data to Third Parties?
Yes, a consumer can opt-out of the sale of personal data to third parties. A consumer can also designate a third party to opt-out on his or her behalf.
Does the CTDPA Protect the Personal Data of Children and Teens?
Yes. If a child’s personal data is being processed by a controller, the child’s parent or legal guardian may exercise rights on the child’s behalf. Controllers must follow all regulations concerning children’s online privacy established pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), including parental consent requirements. In addition, the CTDPA requires controllers to obtain opt-in consent before selling a consumer’s personal data, or processing personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, when the consumer is under 16 years old.
The CTDPA also offers additional protections to minors under 18 years old when interacting with a controller that offers an online service, product, or feature to minors.
Can a Controller Deny a Consumer Rights Request?
Yes, for certain specified reasons under the CTDPA. For example, a controller may deny a consumer’s request if fulfilling the request would restrict the controller’s ability to:
Provide a product or service specifically requested by the consumer.
Perform certain internal operations that reasonably align with consumer expectations.
Issue a product recall or repair technical errors.
Respond to and prevent security incidents, identity theft, and fraud.
Comply with federal, state, or local law.
For more exceptions, see Section 10 of the CTDPA.
Does a Consumer have a Right to Appeal a Denial?
Yes. The CTDPA grants consumers the right to appeal a controller’s decision denying a consumer rights request. A controller has 60 days after receipt of an appeal to write back to the consumer, explaining any actions it has taken and reasons for refusing a consumer request. If the appeal is denied, the controller must give the consumer information to contact the Attorney General should the consumer wish to file a complaint.
How Often Can a Consumer Request Information About their Personal Data from a Controller? Is there a Cost?
A consumer can request information from a controller free once every 12 months. Under certain circumstances beyond the annual request, the controller may charge an administrative fee.
What Must Controllers do to Comply with the CTDPA?
Among other obligations, controllers must:
Provide notice
regarding the types of personal data the controller processes, the purpose(s) for processing, whether and why the controller shares personal data with third parties, and information about how consumers can exercise their various rights (e.g. access, deletion) over their personal data.
Limit collection
of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for the specific purpose(s) for which the data is processed (also known as “data minimization”).
Obtain consent
before processing a consumer’s sensitive data.
Respond to requests
to exercise consumer rights granted under the CTDPA.
Honor consumers’ choice
to opt out of any processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt out preference signal (see section titled Do all Controllers need to Honor Opt Out Preference Signals?).
Conduct assessments
before processing personal data in a manner that presents a heightened risk of harm to consumers (called “Data Protection Assessments”). This includes processing personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, sale, or profiling, and processing sensitive data.
Use reasonable safeguards
to secure personal data.
Not discriminate
against consumers who exercise their rights under CTDPA or process personal data in a manner that would otherwise result in unlawful discrimination.
How Long does a Controller have to Respond to a Consumer's Request?
A controller must respond to a consumer’s requests no later than 45 days after receipt of the request. Under certain conditions, the controller may extend the response period by 45 days.
What is the Attorney General's role in enforcing the CTDPA?
The Attorney General has exclusive authority to enforce violations of the Act.
Is there a Private Right of Action for Individuals?
No, the CTDPA does not include a private cause of action.
Is there a Cure Period?
Yes. If the Attorney General determines that a controller could remedy a violation of the CTDPA, the Attorney General must give the controller notice of the violation before initiating a lawsuit. The controller then has 60 days to remedy the violation (called “the right to cure”). If, however, the Attorney General determines that it would not be possible for the controller to remedy the violation, no such notice or remedial opportunity is required. The right to cure sunsets on December 31, 2024.
What are the Penalties for Failing to Comply with the CTDPA?
Entities or individuals that violate the CTDPA may face civil penalties up to $5,000 per violation, pursuant to the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. In addition to civil penalties, the Attorney General can also seek injunctive relief, restitution, and/or disgorgement.
What are some additional protections the CTDPA affords to minors (under age 18) when interacting with a controller that offers an online service, product, or feature?
Some additional protections include requiring:
That a controller shall use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to minors;
A controller shall not process a minor’s data for purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) sale, or (iii) profiling without obtaining proper consent;
A controller shall not use any design feature to significantly increase, sustain or extend any minor’s use of an online service, product or feature without consent;
A controller shall not collect a minor’s precise geolocation data unless such collection is necessary, and the controller provides the minor a signal indicating that the controller is collecting such data that is available for the entire duration of the collection;
A controller shall provide consent mechanisms that do not subvert or undermine user autonomy, decision-making, or choice;
A controller shall not offer any direct messaging apparatus for use by minors without providing readily accessible and easy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of adults to send unsolicited communications to minors with whom they are not connected;
A controller must conduct data protection assessments for any online product, service, or feature offered to minors.

§ 12D-104. Consumer personal data rights.
(a) A consumer has the right to do all of the following:
(1) Confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer’s personal data and access such personal data, unless such confirmation or access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret.
(2) Correct inaccuracies in the consumer’s personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer’s personal data.
(3) Delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer.
(4) Obtain a copy of the consumer’s personal data processed by the controller, in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means, provided such controller shall not be required to reveal any trade secret.
(5) Obtain a list of the categories of third parties to which the controller has disclosed the consumer’s personal data.
(6) Opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of any of the following:
a. Targeted advertising.
b. The sale of personal data, except as provided in subsection (b) of § 12D-106 of this chapter.
c. Profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
(b) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means established by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller’s privacy notice. A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with § 12D-105 of this chapter to exercise the rights of such consumer to opt out of the processing of such consumer’s personal data for purposes of paragraph (a)(5) of this section on behalf of the consumer. In the case of processing personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on the child’s behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such rights on the consumer’s behalf.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to said sections as follows:
(1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer’s requests, provided the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period and of the reason for the extension.
(2) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer’s request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision.
(3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller, free of charge, once per consumer during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.
(4) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded under paragraphs (1) through (5), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise such right or rights until such consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate such consumer and such consumer’s request to exercise such right or rights. A controller shall not be required to authenticate an opt-out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and documented belief that such request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes such request is fraudulent, the controller shall send a notice to the person who made such request disclosing that such controller believes such request is fraudulent, why such controller believes such request is fraudulent, and that such controller shall not comply with such request.
(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer’s request to delete such data pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section if the controller retains a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer’s personal data remains deleted from the controller’s records and does not use such retained data for any other purpose.
(d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller’s refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer’s receipt of the decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Department of Justice to submit a complaint.
§ 12D-105. Designation of agent to exercise rights of consumer, including through universal opt-out mechanisms.
(a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent to act on the consumer’s behalf to opt out of the processing of such consumer’s personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (a)(5) of § 12D-104 of this chapter. The consumer may designate such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a platform, technology, or mechanism, including an Internet link or a browser setting, browser extension, or global device setting, indicating such consumer’s intent to opt out of such processing. For the purposes of such designation, the platform, technology, or mechanism may function as the agent for purposes of conveying the consumer’s decision to opt-out.
(b) A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent’s authority to act on such consumer’s behalf. The Department of Justice may publish or reference on its website a list of agents who presumptively shall have such authority unless the controller has established a reasonable basis to conclude that the agent lacks such authority.
§ 12D-106. Duties of controllers.
(a) A controller shall do all of the following:
(1) Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer.
(2) Except as otherwise permitted by this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer’s consent.
(3) Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.
(4) Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer’s consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without first obtaining consent from the child’s parent or lawful guardian and otherwise complying with § 1204C of Chapter 12C of this title.
(5) Not process personal data in violation of the laws of this State and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination.
(6) Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer’s consent under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer’s consent and, upon revocation of such consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after the receipt of such request.
(7) Not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer’s personal data without the consumer’s consent, under circumstances where a controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards that the consumer is at least thirteen years of age but younger than 18 years of age.
(8) Not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.
(b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer’s voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.
(c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes all of the following:
(1) The categories of personal data processed by the controller.
(2) The purpose for processing personal data.
(3) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller’s decision with regard to the consumer’s request.
(4) The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any.
(5) The categories of third parties with which the controller shares personal data, if any.
(6) An active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller.
(d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.
(e)(1) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in the privacy notice required by subsection (c) of this section, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer or the consumer’s authorized agent to use an existing account. Any such means shall include all of the following:
a.1. Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller’s Internet web site to an Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising or the sale of the consumer’s personal data.
2. Not later than [one year following the effective date of this Act], allowing a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent, with such consumer’s consent, by a platform, technology, or mechanism to the controller indicating such consumer’s intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. Such platform, technology, or mechanism shall do all of the following:
A. Not unfairly disadvantage another controller.
B. Not make use of a default setting, but, rather, require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt out of any processing of such consumer’s personal data pursuant to this chapter.
C. Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer.
D. Be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform, technology, or mechanism required by any federal or state law or regulation.
E. Enable the controller to reasonably determine whether the consumer is a resident of the State and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such consumer’s personal data or targeted advertising.
b. If a consumer’s decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1)a. of this subsection conflicts with the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller shall comply with such consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such consumer the choice to confirm such controller-specific privacy setting or participation in such program.
(2) If a controller responds to consumer opt‐out requests received pursuant to paragraph (1)a. of this subsection by informing the consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to paragraph (1)b. of this subsection for the retention, use, sale, or sharing of the consumer’s personal data.
§ 12D-107. Duties of processors.
(a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations under this chapter. Such assistance must include all of the following:
(1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s obligation to respond to consumer rights requests.
(2) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security, as defined in § 12B-101(1) of Chapter 12B of this title, of the system of the processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations.
(3) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.
(b) A contract between a controller and a processor must govern the processor’s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract must be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must also require that the processor to do all of the following:
(1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data.
(2) At the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law.
(3) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor’s compliance with the obligations in this chapter.
(4) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.
(5) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller’s designated assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor’s policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.
(c) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of such controller’s or processor’s role in the processing relationship, as described in this chapter.
(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person’s processing of personal data pursuant to a controller’s instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller’s instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under this chapter.
§ 12D-108. Data protection assessments.
(a) A controller that controls or processes the data of not less than 100,000 consumers, excluding data controlled or processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, shall conduct and document, on a regular basis, a data protection assessment for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes any of the following:
(1) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising.
(2) The sale of personal data.
(3) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of any of the following:
a. Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers.
b. Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers.
c. A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person.
d. Other substantial injury to consumers.
(4) The processing of sensitive data.
(b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any such data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
(c) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter. Data protection assessments must be treated as confidential and are not public records within the meaning of § 10002(o) of Chapter 100 of Title 29. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a controller’s data protection assessment may be used in an action to enforce this chapter. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes and conspicuously identifies information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure by itself does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.
(d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.
(e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this section if such data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
(f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated on or after [six months following the effective date of this chapter] and are not retroactive.
§ 12D-109. De-identified data.
(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data, or to maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.
(b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if all of the following apply:
(1) The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data.
(2) The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.
(3) The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.
(c) The rights afforded under paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, of subsection (a) of § 12D-104 of this chapter do not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such information.
(d) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments. The determination of the reasonableness of such oversight and the appropriateness of contractual enforcement must take into account whether the disclosed data includes data that would be sensitive data if it were re-identified.
§ 12D-110. Exclusions.
(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller’s or processor’s ability to do any of the following:
(1) Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.
(2) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental authorities.
(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.
(4) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims.
(5) Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer.
(6) Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty.
(7) Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract.
(8) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or another individual, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis.
(9) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or security of systems, or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such activity.
(10) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board that determines whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller, the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks, and whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification.
(11) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the activities under this subsection.
(b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter, other than those imposed by § 12D-109 of this chapter, do not restrict a controller’s or processor’s ability to collect consumer data, or use or retain such data, for internal use only, to do any of the following:
(1) Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or technology.
(2) Effectuate a product recall.
(3) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality.
(4) Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer’s existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
(c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with said sections would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State as part of a privileged communication.
(d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in compliance with this chapter shall not be deemed to have violated said sections if the processor or third-party controller that receives and processes such personal data violates said sections, provided that (i) at the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed such personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller had violated or would violate said sections and (ii) the disclosing controller or processor was, and remained, in compliance with its obligations as the discloser of such data hereunder. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation of said sections for the independent misconduct of the controller or processor from which such third-party controller or processor receives such personal data.
(e) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to do any of the following:
(1) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights of any person to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or § 5 of Article I of the Delaware Constitution of 1897.
(2) Apply to any person’s processing of personal data in the course of such person’s purely personal or household activities.
(f) Personal data processed pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section, and is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use, or retention of personal data.
(g) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in subsection (f) of this section.
(h) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to such processing.
§ 12D-111. Enforcement.
(a) The Department of Justice has enforcement authority over this chapter and may investigate and prosecute violations of this chapter in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter II of Chapter 25 of Title 29.
(b) During the period beginning on [the effective date of this act], and ending on December 31, 2025, the Department of Justice shall, prior to initiating any action for a violation of any provision of this chapter, issue a notice of violation to the controller if the Department of Justice determines that a cure is possible. If the controller fails to cure such violation within 60 days of receipt of the notice of violation, the Department of Justice may bring an enforcement proceeding pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
(c) Beginning on January 1, 2026, the Department of Justice may, in determining whether to grant a controller or processor the opportunity to cure an alleged violation of any provision of this chapter, the Department of Justice may consider all of the following:
(1) The number of violations.
(2) The size and complexity of the controller or processor.
(3) The nature and extent of the controller’s or processor’s processing activities.
(4) The substantial likelihood of injury to the public.
(5) The safety of persons or property.
(6) Whether such alleged violation was likely caused by human or technical error.
(7) The extent to which the controller or processor has violated this or similar laws in the past.
(d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as providing the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for violations of said sections or any other law.
(e) A violation of this chapter shall be deemed an unlawful practice under § 2513 of Chapter 25 of this title and a violation of Subchapter II of Chapter 25 of this title, and shall be enforced solely by the Department of Justice.
Section 2. Beginning at least 6 months prior to the effective date of this Act, the Department of Justice shall engage in public outreach to educate consumers and the business community about the Act.
Section 3. If this Act is enacted before or on January 1, 2024, this Act takes effect on January 1, 2025. If this Act is enacted after January 1, 2024, this Act takes effect on January 1, 2026.
Section 4. If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect any other provision or application of the Act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application; and, to that end, the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.

Texas Data Privacy And Security Act
Texas Data Pri­va­cy And Secu­ri­ty Act
Texas Data Privacy And Security Act
(“Act”) (
effective July 1, 2024
)
[1]
The Act grants Texas residents several key rights over their personal data. It also establishes privacy protection safeguards which apply to companies that “conduct business in [Texas] or produce a product or service consumed by residents of [Texas]” and that collect, use, store, sell, share, analyze, or process consumers’ personal data. “Personal data” generally means any information, including sensitive data, that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual.
Small businesses (as defined by the federal Small Business Administration) are generally exempt from the Act, except that if a small business sells the sensitive data of a consumer, it must first obtain the consumer’s consent.  “Sensitive data” includes precise geolocation data and also the personal data of a child under the age of 13.

Overview Of The Texas Data Privacy And Security Act
This overview is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice. Please consult your attorney if you have specific legal questions.
Texas law prohibits the Office of the Attorney General from providing legal advice, opinions, or representation to private individuals.
Consumer Rights Under The Act Include:
Right to know whether a company is processing the consumer’s personal data and to obtain the personal data in a readable format;
Right to correct inaccuracies in the consumer’s personal data, taking into account the nature of the data and the purposes for processing the data;
Right to delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;
Right to opt out of the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, or profiling in furtherance of a decision made by the company concerning the consumer that results in the provision or denial by the company of the following:
financial and lending services;
housing, insurance, or health care services;
education enrollment;
employment opportunities;
criminal justice; or
access to basic necessities, such as food and water.
Right to not face retaliation or discrimination for exercising these rights.
CONTROLLERS (AS DEFINED BY THE ACT) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESPONDING TO CONSUMER REQUESTS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS AND MUST COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS OF THE ACT.  THESE INCLUDE:
Providing consumers with a reasonably accessible and clear Privacy Notice with all required disclosures including:
the categories of personal data processed by the controller (including any sensitive data) and the purpose of processing such data;
the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties (if any);
the categories of third parties with whom the controller shares personal data (if any);
how consumers may exercise their rights under the Act including a description of the methods through which consumers can submit requests to exercise their rights under the Act and how to appeal a controller’s decisions; and
If the company sells Sensitive Personal Data or Biometric Data, the Privacy Notice must include specific disclosures mandated by the Act:
NOTICE:  We may sell your sensitive personal data.
NOTICE:  We may sell your biometric data.
Companies that sell personal data to third parties or process such data for targeted advertising must also clearly and conspicuously disclose that, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise their right to opt out of that process.
Limiting their collection of personal data to “what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to” the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed, as was disclosed to the consumer.
Establishing two or more secure and reliable methods to enable consumers to submit requests to exercise their rights under the Act.
Companies that operate exclusively online and have a direct relationship with a consumer are required only to provide an email address for the submission of requests.
Responding to an authenticated consumer’s request to exercise any right without undue delay but no later than 45 days after receiving the request.
The time period to substantively respond to a request may be extended by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary – provided the company responds within the initial 45 days and provides a reason for the extension.
A company’s response to a consumer request must be free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer – unless the request is unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, in which case the consumer may be charged a reasonable administrative cost.
A company that declines a consumer’s request must provide the consumer with notice of that decision, including a justification for the declination and instructions on how to appeal the decision.
Establishing a process for consumers to appeal the company’s decisions. If the company denies an appeal, the company must provide the consumer with information regarding how to submit a complaint regarding the matter to the Texas Attorney General.
Establishing, implementing, and maintaining reasonable data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data.
Implementing reasonable measures to ensure deidentified data cannot be associated with an individual; publicly committing to maintain and use the data without attempting to reidentify the data; and contractually obligating recipients of the data to comply with the Act.
Entering into data processing contracts with data processors which include all elements required by the Act, including requiring the processor to impose on its sub-processors the rights and obligations of the controller’s data processing contract.
Conducting data protection assessments for certain processing activities, including processing for purposes of targeted advertising; the sale of personal data; processing for purposes of profiling when profiling presents certain “reasonably foreseeable risk[s]”; processing of sensitive data; and any processing that “present[s] a heightened risk of harm to consumers.”
Data protection assessments must be made available to the Texas Attorney General and are exempt from disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act.  Disclosure of an assessment to the Texas Attorney General does not constitute a waiver of the attorney client or work product privilege.
Prohibitions
Requiring a consumer to create a new account in order to submit requests to exercise  rights;
Discriminating against a consumer for exercising rights under the Act, including by charging different prices, denying goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods or services;
Processing sensitive data without first obtaining a consumer’s consent;
Processing the data of a known child without first obtaining parental consent;
Processing data in violation of state and federal laws which prohibit unlawful discrimination; or
Processing personal data for a purpose that is neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purpose for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, without first obtaining the consumer’s consent.
PROCESSORS (PERSONS THAT PROCESS DATA ON BEHALF OF AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A CONTROLLER) MUST COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS OF THE ACT INCLUDING:
Adhering to a controller’s instructions; and
Assisting the controller in complying with the controller’s duties under the Act – including by assisting the controller in responding to consumer rights requests, assisting with the requirement relating to the security of processing personal data, and providing the controller with information necessary to conduct Data Protection Assessments.
Enforcement
The Texas Attorney General has exclusive authority to enforce the Act, and may issue civil investigative demands, and file enforcement actions to obtain civil penalties, injunctive relief, attorney’s fees, and costs.
Prior to filing an enforcement action, the Texas Attorney General must provide a written notice of violation and allow a company 30 days in which to cure the noticed violations. The company must provide a written statement and supporting documentation evidencing that the violations were cured. The written documentation must include whether changes to internal policies were necessary to ensure that no future violations occur.
A company that violates the Act following the cure period or that breaches a written statement provided to the Attorney General is liable for a civil penalty of up to $ 7,500 per violation.
The Act does not provide a private right of action.
File a consumer complaint regarding the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act with the Texas Attorney General

Exemptions
The Act
exempts six types of entities: state agencies and political subdivisions of the state, financial institutions governed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), entities governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education.
The Act also exempts certain types of information, including information governed by GLB, HIPAA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, Farm Credit Act, and certain other types of personal data and employment-related information. The Act also does not apply to the processing of personal data by an individual for personal or household activities.
Key Definitions Include:
“PERSONAL DATA”
means any information, including sensitive data, that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual. This term includes pseudonymous data when the data is used in conjunction with additional information that reasonably links the data to an identified or identifiable individual. Publicly available information and deidentified data are not “personal data.”
“SENSITIVE DATA”
is a subset of personal data that includes:
Any data revealing racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions or diagnoses, sexuality, citizenship, or immigration status;
Genetic or biometric data processed to uniquely identify an individual;
Personal data of a child under the age of 13; and
Precise geolocation data (information that identifies an individual’s specific location with a defined degree of precision and accuracy).
“BIOMETRIC DATA”
means data generated by automatic measurements of an individual's biological characteristics. It does not include a physical or digital photograph, a video or audio recording or data generated from such a recording, or information collected, used, or stored for health care treatment, payment, or operations under HIPAA.
“DEIDENTIFIED DATA”
means data that cannot reasonably be linked to an identified or identifiable individual, or a device linked to that individual.
“CHILD”
means an individual younger than 13 years of age and "known child" means a child under circumstances where a controller has actual knowledge of, or willfully disregards, the child's age.
“CONSENT”
- A consumer’s consent must be freely given, informed, and unambiguous, and does not include agreements obtained through the use of dark patterns or by acceptance of broad, general terms or hovering over, pausing, or closing a given piece of content.
“SALE”
of data means sharing, disclosing, or transferring data for monetary or other valuable consideration. Certain types of disclosures or transfers which are not deemed a sale include: disclosing the data to a third party in order to provide a product or service requested by the consumer; the disclosure of information that the consumer intentionally made available through a mass media channel and did not restrict to a specific audience; and disclosure to a third party as an asset that is part of a merger or acquisition.

[RSA 507-H:4 effective January 1, 2025.]
RSA 507-H effective January 1, 2025.
507-H:4 Consumer Expectation of Privacy. –
I. A consumer shall have the right to:
(a) Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and access such personal data, unless such confirmation or access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret;
(b) Correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;
(c) Delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer;
(d) Obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data processed by the controller, in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means, provided such controller shall not be required to reveal any trade secret; and
(e) Opt-out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, except as provided in RSA 507-H:6, or profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
II. A consumer may exercise rights under this section by any secure and reliable means described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice. A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with RSA 507-H:5 to exercise the rights of such consumer to opt-out of the processing of such consumer's personal data for purposes of RSA 507-H:4, III(e) on behalf of the consumer. In the case of processing personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on the child's behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such rights on the consumer's behalf.
III. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this chapter as follows:
(a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period and of the reason for the extension.
(b) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision.
(c) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller, free of charge, once per consumer during any twelve-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request.
(d) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded under RSA 507-H:4, I(a)-(d) using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise such right or rights until such consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate such consumer and such consumer's request to exercise such right or rights. A controller shall not be required to authenticate an opt-out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable and documented belief that such request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes such request is fraudulent, the controller shall send a notice to the person who made such request disclosing that such controller believes such request is fraudulent, why such controller believes such request is fraudulent and that such controller shall not comply with such request.
(e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such data pursuant to RSA 507-H:4, I(c) by retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to this chapter, or opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant this chapter.
IV. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.

507-H:5 Consumer Agents. –
A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, and act on such consumer's behalf, to opt-out of the processing of such consumer's personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in RSA 507-H:4, I(e). The consumer may designate such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a browser setting, browser extension or global device setting, indicating such consumer's intent to opt-out of such processing. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on such consumer's behalf.

507-H:6 Controller Responsibilities. –
I. A controller shall:
(a) Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;
(c) Establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;
(d) Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with COPPA;
(e) Not process personal data in violation of the laws of this state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers;
(f) Provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of such consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after the receipt of such request; and
(g) Not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent, under circumstances where a controller has actual knowledge, and wilfully disregards, that the consumer is at least 13 years of age but younger than 16 years of age. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.
II. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program.
III. A controller shall provide consumers with a clear and meaningful privacy notice in a reasonably accessible format. The controller may make the notice available online, on accompanying mobile applications, or on a device through which consumers regularly interact with the controller, if applicable. Said notice shall also be reasonably accessible to consumers with disabilities, including through the use of digital accessibility tools. The notice must include the following:
(a) The categories of personal data processed by the controller;
(b) The purpose for processing personal data;
(c) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;
(d) The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any;
(e) The categories of third-parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data;
(f) An active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller; and
(g) The date the privacy notice was last updated.
IV. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt-out of such processing.
V. (a) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in the privacy notice required by paragraph III, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. Any such means shall include:
(1)(A) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's Internet website to an Internet webpage that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt-out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer's personal data; and
(B) Not later than January 1, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt-out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent, with such consumer's consent, by a platform, technology, or mechanism to the controller indicating such consumer's intent to opt-out of any such processing or sale. Such platform, technology, or mechanism shall:
(i) Not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
(ii) Not make use of a default setting, but, rather, require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt-out of any processing of such consumer's personal data pursuant to this chapter;
(iii) Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
(iv) Be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform, technology or mechanism required by any federal or state law or regulation; and
(v) Enable the controller to accurately determine whether the consumer is a resident of this state and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt-out of any sale of such consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.
(2) If a consumer's decision to opt-out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with RSA 507-H:6, V(a)(1)(A) conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with such consumer's opt-out preference signal, but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such consumer the choice to confirm such controller-specific privacy setting or participation in such program.
(b) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received pursuant to RSA 507-H:6, V(a)(1) by informing the consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to 507-H:6, II for the retention, use, sale or sharing of the consumer's personal data.

[RSA 507-H:7 effective January 1, 2025.]
RSA 507-H effective January 1, 2025.
507-H:7 Processor Responsibilities. –
I. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under this chapter. Such assistance shall include:
(a) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
(b) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security or of the system of the processor, in order to meet the controller's obligations; and
(c) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.
II. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also require that the processor:
(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
(b) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;
(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
(d) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data; and
(e) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.
III. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of such controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship, as described in this chapter.
IV. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under RSA 507-H:11.

(a) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
(b) The sale of personal data;
(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers, financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers, a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person, or other substantial injury to consumers; and
(d) The processing of sensitive data.
II. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to RSA 507-H:8, I shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any such data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
III. The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.
IV. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.
V. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this section if such data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
VI. Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated after July 1, 2024, and are not retroactive.

507-H:9 De-Identifed Data. –
I. Any controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
(a) Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an individual;
(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to reidentify the data; and
(c) Contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply with all provisions of this chapter.
II. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:
(a) Require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or
(b) Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.
III. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
(a) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;
(b) Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and
(c) Does not sell the personal data to any third-party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.
IV. The rights afforded under RSA 507-H:4, I(a)-(d) shall not apply to pseudonymized data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such information.
V. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or deidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

507-H:10 Controller Responsibilities and Obligations. –
I. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
(a) Comply with federal, state or municipal ordinances or regulations;
(b) Comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or summons by federal, state, municipal or other governmental authorities;
(c) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state or municipal ordinances or regulations;
(d) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;
(e) Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;

(j) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored and governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar independent oversight entities that determine;
(1) Whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
(2) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
(3) Whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
(k) Assist another controller, processor, or third-party with any of the obligations under this chapter; or
(l) Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health, or population health, but solely to the extent that such processing is:
(1) Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and
(2) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law.
II. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for internal use to:

(b) Effectuate a product recall;
(c) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or

III. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with said sections would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged communication.
IV. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in accordance with this chapter shall not be deemed to have violated said sections if the processor or third-party controller that receives and processes such personal data violates said sections, provided, at the time the disclosing controller or processor disclosed such personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate said sections. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation of said sections for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which such third-party controller or processor receives such personal data.
V. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:
(a) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; or
(b) Apply to any person's processing of personal data in the course of such person's purely personal or household activities.
VI. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is:

(b) Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used, or retained under RSA 507-H:10, I(b), where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use or retention of personal data.
VII. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in RSA 507-H:10, VI.
VIII. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to such processing.

507-H:12 Compliance with Other Law. –
An individual or entity covered by this chapter and other law regarding third party providers of information and services is required to comply with both chapters, provided, however, that to the extent there is a direct conflict between the 2 chapters which precludes compliance with both statutes, the individual or entity shall comply with the statute that provides the greater measure of privacy protection to individuals. For purposes of this section, an "opt in" procedure for an individual to grant consent for the disclosure of personal information shall be deemed to provide a greater measure of protection of privacy than the "opt out" procedure established under this chapter.

Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
(Utah Code § 13-61-101)
As a Utah consumer, you have the right to protect your personal data under the UCPA, a law that became effective on December 31, 2023. Understanding your rights under the new law and how you can exercise them is essential. Likewise, businesses operating in Utah must understand their responsibilities under this new law.
What are your consumer rights under the UCPA?
The UCPA provides Utah consumers with several essential rights concerning their personal data. You have the right to confirm whether a business is processing your personal data. If a business is processing your data, you have the right to access that data and request it be deleted. You can also obtain a copy of the data you previously provided to the business.
Another critical right that Utah consumers have is the right to opt out from companies selling their data, and from the use of their personal data for targeted advertising.
Which businesses does the UCPA apply to?
The UCPA specifically applies to controllers and processors who either conduct business in the State of Utah or produce a product or service targeted to consumers who are residents of the State of Utah. These controllers and processors must:
Have an annual revenue of $25,000,000 or more and either
Control or process personal data of 100,000 or more consumers during a calendar year, OR
Derive over 50% of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data and control or process personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.
What are the responsibilities of businesses under the UCPA?
Under the UCPA, persons who control how personal data is processed (“controllers”) or persons who actually process personal data on behalf of a business (“processors”) must establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices designed to:
Protect the confidentiality and integrity of a consumer’s personal data, and
Reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the processing of their personal data.
A
covered
business operating in Utah
to
provide consumers
with a reasonably accessible and clear privacy notice. This notice must describe the categories of personal data, the business processes, the purposes for which the data are processed, and how consumers can exercise their rights under the new law. The notice must also specify the categories of personal data that the business shares with third parties, if any, and the categories of third parties with whom the data is shared.
If a business sells personal data or uses it for targeted advertising, it must inform consumers and provide them with a way to opt-out. The UCPA also applies to sensitive data, such as health or financial information.
How can you request access to your personal data?
If you wish to exercise any of these rights mentioned in the UCPA, you can submit a request to a business specifying which right you intend to exercise. The business must respond to your request within 45 days.
What if you have any complaints or need more information?
If you have any complaints or need more information about the UCPA, you can file a complaint with the Division at the provided link or
read the UCPA here.
The UCPA is a significant step towards protecting your personal data as a Utah consumer. Ensure you understand your rights under the new law and exercise them if necessary. At the same time, businesses operating in Utah must comply with the law and fulfill their responsibilities.
