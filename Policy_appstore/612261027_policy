State laws and individual companies may give you additional right to limit sharing. See below for more on your rights under state law.

Wise Facial Scan Privacy Notice
Last updated: 7 July 2021
This Wise Facial Scan Privacy Notice describes how Wise, or its ID verification service provider on Wise’s behalf, handles facial scan data of its Customers. The terms of this Wise Facial Scan Privacy Notice shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency with other terms or notices provided to you.
As part of our identity verification process, biometric data, namely face scan information extracted from photos, or videos, is processed to compare with each other pictures of you on identity documents and on a selfie, or a facial image captured from a video, that you provide for the exclusive purpose of verifying your identity.
We carry out this processing with your consent. If you do not consent, we offer alternative methods to verify your identity which do not involve the collection, processing or storage of biometric data. However, this alternative method may take longer than the automated process. You may revoke this consent at any time in the settings under the Privacy tab of your Wise Account.
The collection, processing and storage of biometric information is carried out either:
directly by Wise, in which case your biometric data remains solely within our internal server or cloud; or
by an ID verification service provider, such as Onfido, on Wise behalf. In this latter case, when consenting to the biometric check, you confirm you have read, understood and accepted the
Onfido Facial Scan Policy and Release
,
Onfido Privacy Policy
,
and
Onfido Terms of Service
.
Wise and our ID verification service providers (including Onfido and their own service providers) do not share, disseminate or otherwise disclose your biometric data to any other third party, unless required by applicable laws or pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena.
Your biometric data will be permanently destroyed when we know longer need it. It will be retained for a maximum period of 1 year, however in most cases it will be deleted much earlier, unless Wise is required by law or legal process to retain the data for a longer period.
Wise and our ID verification service providers will never sell, lease, trade or otherwise profit from the biometric data.
Should you have any questions, comments or requests regarding this Notice, you can always reach out to our privacy team at privacy@wise.com.

Make a privacy complaint
We're keen to work with New Zealanders to get their privacy queries and complaints sorted quickly and fairly. Before you complain to us, you need to
complain directly to the business or organisation that you feel has breached your privacy.
If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with them,
then you can complain to us
. We aim to ensure that you're treated fairly, whatever your background or circumstances. We work in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1993.

We review all the complaints we receive. If we can resolve them quickly, we will. If your case requires a complicated or comprehensive investigation, then owing to high volumes, the wait time for an investigator is up to six months.
Privacy Amendment Bill: what you need to know
The Privacy Amendment Bill is making its way through Parliament, and we know organisations are starting to think about how this will impact them. We’ve put together key information on the Bill, which we’ll update as it progresses.

Agencies: report a data breach
If you're an organisation and have a privacy breach that is likely to cause anyone serious harm, you are legally required to notify us and any affected persons as soon as you can.
As a guide, our expectation is that a breach notification should be made to our Office no later than 72 hours after agencies are aware of a notifiable privacy breach.
