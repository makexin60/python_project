[Data Collection, Sharing, and Handling Procedures of the App]
Collection and Use of Location Information
The Company collects location information to enhance services and provide customized services to users, which is solely used for service improvement within the app. Location information is collected only with the explicit consent of the user and is used for the following purposes:
To find nearby users and connect them with each other.
To provide approximate location information to the other party during certain features (e.g., showing distance or region).
To provide personalized services based on the user's location when specific functions are executed.
Location information is processed in a form that does not allow personal identification and is not disclosed under any circumstances.
Users can withdraw their consent at any time, and upon withdrawal of consent, collected location information is immediately destroyed and no longer used or provided. The purpose and scope of the collection, use, and provision of location information are in accordance with this privacy policy.
Shared Data
Data logs of app crashes are shared for improving the app’s information and performance. We use
Firebase Crashlytics
for collecting these logs. This crash data may include device information and app usage data, but does not include personally identifiable information.
Collected Data
Phone numbers (for Korean users), in-app messages, media files (photos, videos, audio), and device IDs unique to this app are collected for the app's functionality. These data are stored securely and only retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the service features.
Security Practices
Data in transit is encrypted. Users can request data deletion using the app's withdrawal feature.
Media Collection and Use
The application includes features for users to upload images, videos, and audio messages for use as profile pictures or to share with other users.
Image Collection: When uploading images for use as profile pictures or for sharing in chats, those images are collected and stored.
Image Use: Uploaded images are used only as intended by the user. Images uploaded as profile pictures are displayed on the user's profile, and images shared in chats are shown to the message recipients.
Video and Audio Message Collection: Video and audio messages sent for communication between users are collected and stored.
Automatic Media Deletion: Profile images, shared images, videos, and audio messages are automatically deleted from servers within 2-3 days for privacy protection. Profile images are also automatically deleted upon user deletion or withdrawal.
[In-App Purchase and Subscription Details]
This app may provide subscription services (auto-renewable or recurring) through in-app purchases on both Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The Company does not collect or store any direct payment information (e.g., credit card numbers). All payment and subscription details are handled by Apple or Google, depending on the platform used. The Company only verifies whether the payment has been successfully completed.
If we collect any user identifiers (e.g., user ID or device token) to verify the subscription status, they are stored and used solely for confirming and providing subscription features (e.g., unlocking premium content). We do not use them for any other purpose.
[Provision and Sharing of Personal Information]
As a principle, the Company does not disclose members' personal information to unrelated companies or institutions outside of the service-related apps (random chat apps of the same company). However, personal information may be provided without consent in the following exceptional cases:
If it is deemed necessary to disclose personal information for legal actions against individuals who violate the Company's terms of service or use the Company's services to cause harm to others or to public morals and order.
When required by law or for investigative purposes, in accordance with the procedures and methods outlined in the law upon request from investigative authorities.
[Access, Correction, and Withdrawal of Personal Information]
Members can access, correct, or delete their personal information entered at the time of membership registration by selecting the "Withdrawal" menu. Furthermore, personal information collected for service provision (device identifier values) is immediately destroyed once the purpose of use has been achieved.
[Management of Personal IDs and Passwords]
The ID used by members, represented by the device identifier value, is intended for use by the member only. The Company is not responsible for any problems arising from the theft or use of the member's device identifier by others, in the absence of the Company's intent or negligence. Special care should be taken during log-on sessions to prevent the disclosure of personal information to others.
