# 2: Who can you contact regarding the processing of personal data?
As part of the implementation of a data protection system in our organisation, we have decided not to appoint a Data Protection Officer due to the fact that it is not mandatory in our situation.
In matters relating to data protection and privacy more broadly, you can contact
contact@showyourscore.com, by
email. In terms of social media, you can additionally contact directly the administrators of the social networks on which we maintain our profiles.
# 3: For what purposes do we process personal data?
There are more than one of these objectives. Below is a list of them, together with a more detailed discussion. We have also assigned the respective legal bases for processing to the various purposes:
Purpose of processing
Discussion of the purpose of processing
Legal basis
User account handling
When you create a user account, you must provide the data necessary to set up your account as specified in the registration form.
The provision of data is a prerequisite for creating an account.
As part of editing your account details, you can enter your further details in accordance with the options available within your account.
If you create an account through integration with a social media account, we will gain access to certain data stored within the social media account (name, email address, profile picture) on the basis of your prior authorisation.
In addition, our system used for user accounts records your IP number, which you used when registering your user account.
The data is processed for the purpose of providing the user account service to you. After deletion of your user account, the data is archived for the possible establishment, investigation or defence of claims related to the user account service.
Article 6(1)(b) RODO
Order processing and contract handling
When you place an order, you must provide the data necessary to process the order as specified on the order form.
Provision of data is a prerequisite for placing an order.
In addition, the system used to process your order saves the IP number you used to place the order.
Each order is saved in a database, which means that your personal data assigned to the order is also accompanied by order-related information such as the date and time of the order, order ID, transaction ID, subject of the order, price, method and date of payment, date and time of download (in the case of digital content).
In connection with the conclusion of the contract, it may also process your other personal data in order to perform the services provided for in the contract that has been concluded. The extent of this data depends on which personal data are needed to perform the contract.
Where we receive your data in the performance of a contract, e.g. from an entity that employs you, we base such processing on a legitimate interest, which in this case is to ensure the efficient and effective handling of the contract concluded. In this case, we may process your identifying and contact data.
The data are processed for the purpose of concluding and performing the contract. Once the contract has been performed,
the data goes into the archives for the purpose of possibly establishing, asserting or defending claims related to the contract. Data also goes into the accounting records for the purpose of complying with tax obligations.
Article 6(1)(b) RODO, Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Actions taken to complete orders by customers
As some customers start placing an order but do not complete it (do not validate the order and do not enter into a contract with us), we may take steps to ensure that our customers complete the purchase process.
To this end, we can, for example, send emails containing information about an unfinished order and an incentive to complete the transaction.
For the purposes of the activities described above, we may process personal data such as the information provided during the ordering process, in particular your name and e-mail address, as well as information about the contents of your shopping cart, the date on which the transaction was initiated and other data left in connection with the purchase process.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is Article 6(1)(b) of the RODO, as these activities are aimed at the conclusion of a contract. Furthermore, we see the basis for the processing as our legitimate interest, which in this case is to increase sales.
Article 6(1)(b) RODO, Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Handling complaints or withdrawals
If you make a complaint or withdraw from the contract, you provide the personal data contained in the content of the complaint or withdrawal statement.
The provision of data is a condition for the submission of a declaration of withdrawal or complaint.
The data are processed for the purpose of handling the withdrawal or complaint process. Once such a process has been carried out, the data goes into an archive for the purpose of possibly establishing, asserting or defending claims related to the handling of the withdrawal or complaints process. The data also goes into accounting records for the purpose of complying with tax obligations.
Article 6(1)(c) of the RODO in connection with the relevant provisions on the right of withdrawal and liability for compliance with the contract, Article 6(1)(b) of the RODO
Handling the newsletter
When subscribing to the newsletter, you must provide the necessary data to receive the newsletter as specified in the subscription form.
Provision of data is a condition of receiving the newsletter.
In addition, the mailing system records your IP number, which you used when signing up for the newsletter, determines your approximate location, the mail client you use for email, and tracks your actions taken in relation to the messages sent to you. Accordingly, we also have information about which messages you have opened, within which messages you have clicked on links, etc.
In the mailing system, we may also define, on the basis of various criteria related to your activities, interests or other preferences, specific groups or segments of newsletter recipients that influence what kind of messages you receive in the newsletter.
The data you provide in connection with subscribing to the newsletter is used for the purpose of sending you the newsletter, and the legal basis for its processing is the performance of the electronic service contract, as well as our legitimate interest, which in this case is the fulfilment of marketing purposes.
With regard to the processing of information that does not come from you, but is collected automatically by the mailing system, we rely in this respect on our legitimate interest to analyse the behaviour of newsletter subscribers in order to optimise mailing activities.
You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on the dedicated link included in each message sent as part of the newsletter, or simply by contacting us.
Opting out of the newsletter does not lead to the deletion of your data from the mailing system. The data
is archived for the possible establishment, assertion or defence of claims relating to the newsletter, as well as to ensure that it can be demonstrated that the newsletter activities were carried out in accordance with the law.
Article 6(1)(b) RODO, Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Handling comments/feedback
When you add a comment/feedback, you must provide the data necessary to publish the comment/feedback you receive as set out in the comment/feedback form.
The provision of data is a prerequisite for the publication of the comment / opinion.
In addition, the comment/feedback system records your IP number, which you used when submitting your comment/feedback.
The comment/feedback system may be operated by an external provider. If this is the case, your use of the system is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the external provider. For details of the third-party provider's tools, please see the section on the tools we use.
The data is processed for the purpose of publishing a comment / opinion, which is our legitimate interest.
The comment or opinion you have added, together with your data made public within the settings, will be visible on the website. You can modify or delete your comment or opinion at any time. A deleted comment / opinion together with your data will be archived for the purpose of establishing, investigating or defending claims related to the comment / opinion.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Contact and correspondence handling
When you contact us via the available means of communication, e.g. email, social messaging, chat rooms, etc., you naturally provide your personal data contained in the content of your correspondence.
The provision of data is a condition of contact.
In addition, the communication system records your IP number, which you used when sending the message.
A communication system (e.g. chat, instant messaging) may be operated by an external provider. In such a situation, the use of the system is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the external provider. For details on the tools of external providers, please see the section on the tools we use.
The data is processed for the purpose of carrying out the communication, which is our legitimate interest. Once the communication has ended,
the data
is archived for the possible establishment, investigation or defence of claims related to the communication.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Fulfilment of tax and accounting obligations
In connection with the performance of the contract, we also fulfil various tax and accounting obligations, in particular the issuing of an invoice, the inclusion of the invoice in our accounting records, the retention of records, etc.
In order to issue an invoice, we process data such as name, company, business address, TIN, among others.
The provision of data required by tax law is necessary to fulfil the obligations indicated.
Article 6(1)(c) of the RODO in connection with the relevant provisions of tax law
Creation of an archive
We may create archives for the purposes of our business: both in traditional and digital form. The archives include personal data that we have processed in connection with you, and may vary depending on what data has come to us and the extent of the data justified in terms of archiving. In this case, we rely on our legitimate interest in organising and structuring the personal data carriers.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Defence, establishment or enforcement of claims
The use of our website, as well as the conclusion of a contract with us, may give rise to certain claims on our side or yours in the future. Accordingly, we are entitled to process personal data for the purpose of defending, establishing or asserting claims. As part of this purpose, we may process any personal data that is related to the claim in question, so the extent of the processing may vary depending on what the claim is about. In this case, we rely on our legitimate interest to protect our interests in this regard.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Creation of ad groups
Your e-mail address stored in our database may be sent to a specific advertising system (e.g. Facebook Ads, LinkedIN Ads) in order to create an audience for advertisements using this e-mail address.
When using this function, the email address is hashed before being sent to the relevant system to create a recipient group.
The e-mail address will be used in the matching process conducted by the advertising system concerned.
The advertising system does not share the e-mail address with third parties or other advertisers and deletes the e-mail address immediately after the matching process is completed.
The advertising system implements processes and procedures to ensure the confidentiality and security of the e-mail address sent to it and the set of user identifiers forming the group of recipients created using the e-mail address by, among other things, applying technical and physical safeguards.
The creation of an audience for advertisements using your e-mail address constitutes our legitimate interest, which in this case is the fulfilment of our marketing objectives.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Social media handling
If you follow our social media profiles or interact with content that we publish on social media, we naturally see your data that is publicly available in your social media profile. We process this data only within the respective social network and only for the purpose of operating the respective social network, which is our legitimate interest.
If you contact us by private message, you naturally provide us with your personal data contained in the content of the correspondence, in particular your image and your name. Your data is processed in this case for the purpose of contacting you, and the basis of the processing is our legitimate interest.
It may be the case that we are the party initiating contact with you via social media in order to offer cooperation, in which case your data will be processed for the purpose of seeking potential contractors, offering and establishing cooperation, which is our legitimate interest.
Messages sent to us via social media are automatically archived via the tools available within the individual social media sites and are available to us until you delete them. You have access to all messages exchanged with us in the private messages tab.
Your use of social media sites is subject to the rules and privacy policies of the administrators of those sites, and those administrators provide electronic services to you, fully independently and autonomously of us.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Analysis and statistics using only Anonymous Information
We carry out analytical and statistical activities using tools provided by external providers. As part of the analytical tools, we only have access to Anonymous Information. We base the processing of Anonymous Information on our legitimate interest in creating, viewing and analysing statistics related to user activity on the website in order to draw conclusions for the subsequent optimisation of our activities.
From within the tools, we only have access to a set of statistics and information not assigned to specific individuals.
For details on third-party supplier tools, please see the section on the tools we use.
Article 6(1)(f) RODO

Provision of additional functions using only Anonymous Information
On our pages, we may embed video or audio players, social widgets, a comment module, chat, newsletter forms or other tools provided by third parties. All of these tools process Anonymous Information. We base the processing of Anonymous Information on our legitimate interest, which in this case is to provide you with the opportunity to use additional functions on the website.

Article 6(1)(f) RODO
Implementation of data protection obligations
As a data controller, we are obliged to comply with data protection obligations. Accordingly, we may process your personal data insofar as this is necessary to comply with these obligations (e.g. when processing your request for your personal data).

# 4: What information do we have about you?
We have described the scope of the processing for each purpose of processing. Information in this regard can be found above, in section 3 of the Privacy Policy. Among the data are information such as:
name,
e-mail address,
IP address,
address for service,
invoice details,
details of the order placed,
data collected in the mailing system,
data related to the comment / opinion added,
information visible on social media profiles,
information contained in correspondence,
Anonymous Information.
# 5: What is "Anonymous Information"?
We use tools that collect a range of information about you related to your use of our website and mobile application. This includes, in particular, the following information:
information about the operating system and web browser,
subpages viewed,
time spent on the site,
transitions between individual sub-pages,
clicks on individual links,
mouse movements,
page scrolling,
the source from which you go to the site,
the age range you are in,
Your gender,
Your approximate location limited to the village.
Your interests or other preferences as determined by your online activity,
video recordings of your sessions on our websites,
heat maps illustrating your behaviour on our websites.
This information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Anonymous Information".
Anonymous Information in itself does not, in our view, have the character of personal data, as it does not allow us to identify you and we do not collate it with the typical personal data we collect about you. Nevertheless, given the strict jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the divided opinions among lawyers, as a precaution, in case Anonymous Information is attributed the character of personal data, we have also included detailed explanations in the Privacy Policy regarding the processing of this information.
We are unable to provide you with access to Anonymous Information about you, as we are unable to attribute any of the Anonymous Information to any specific user. From the Anonymous Information collection tools, we only have access to a set of statistics and information that is not attributed to specific individuals.
The processing of Anonymous Information allows us to
provide
you with the functionality available on the website. In addition, Anonymous Information is used for analytical and statistical purposes as well as for marketing purposes, such as setting and targeting advertisements.
Anonymous information is also processed by tool providers under the terms of their terms of service and privacy policies. It may be used by these providers to provide, improve and manage services, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise the content and advertisements displayed on individual services, websites and applications. Please see the section on the tools we use for more detailed information related to this.
# 6: Where do we get your personal data from?
In most cases, you provide them to us yourself. For example, this is the case when you register a user account, place an order, send a complaint or withdraw from a contract, contact us via email or chat, or use the functionalities available on our Site or on external services (e.g. social networks).
In addition, some information about you may be automatically collected by tools we use. Please see the section on the tools we use for details on the tools of third party providers.
In exceptional cases, we may also obtain your personal data from other sources, e.g. when the entity that employs you indicates your data to us as contact persons for contractual matters, or when you represent an entity that enters into a contract with us.
# 7: Is the data safe?
We care about the security of your personal data. We have analysed the risks involved in the various processes of processing your data and then implement appropriate security and personal data protection measures. We monitor the state of the technical infrastructure on an ongoing basis, train staff, look at the
relevant
procedures, and implement the necessary improvements.
# 8: How long will we keep personal data?
We process your personal data for as long as it is justified within the framework of a given purpose for processing your personal data, and therefore processing periods vary depending on the purpose. Please note that the termination of the processing of your data for one purpose does not necessarily lead to the complete erasure or destruction of your personal data, as the same set of data may be processed for another purpose, for the period of time indicated for that purpose. Complete erasure or destruction of data occurs when we have completed all purposes and in other cases indicated in the RODO.

We do not make decisions to you based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that would produce legal effects on you or similarly
affect
you materially. Yes, we do use tools that may take certain actions depending on the information collected through tracking mechanisms, but we consider that these actions do not materially affect you as they do not differentiate your situation as a customer, do not affect the terms of the contract you may enter into with us, etc.
Using certain tools, we can, for example, target you with personalised advertising based on your previous activities on the Site or suggest products that may be of interest to you. This is known as behavioural advertising. We encourage you to learn more about behavioural advertising, particularly with regard to privacy issues. You will find detailed information, including the possibility of managing your settings with regard to behavioural advertising,

The RODO grants you the following potential rights in relation to the processing of your personal data:
The right to access your data and to receive a copy of it;
The right to rectification (amendment) of your data;
The right to erasure (if in your opinion there are no grounds for us to process your data, you can request that we erase it);
The right to restrict processing (you can request that we restrict processing to only storing your data or carrying out activities agreed with you if, in your opinion, we have inaccurate data or are processing it unduly);
The right to object to processing (you have the right to object to processing on the basis of a legitimate interest; you should indicate the particular situation which you think justifies us stopping the processing covered by the objection; we will stop processing your data for these purposes unless we can demonstrate that the grounds for our processing override your rights or that your data is necessary for us to establish, assert or defend our claims);
The right to data portability (you have the right to receive from us in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format the personal data you have provided to us on the basis of a contract or your consent; you can have this data sent directly to another entity);

The rules related to the exercise of the rights indicated above are described in detail in Articles 16-21 of the DPA. We encourage you to familiarise yourself with these provisions. For our part, we consider it necessary to explain to you that the rights indicated above are not absolute and you will not be entitled to them in relation to all processing activities of your personal data.
We emphasise that one of the rights indicated above is always available to you: if you consider that we have violated data protection regulations in the processing of your personal data, you have the possibility to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection).

Facebook Connect
Our website uses plug-ins, buttons and other social media tools, collectively referred to as "plug-ins", associated with social media services managed by the US company Meta Platform Inc.
This gives you the opportunity to use selected social features on our pages, e.g. like button, share, etc.
The plugins collect information about your activity on our site. We do not have access to this information. It is only important to us that the plugins work properly.
The information collected by the plugins may be used by Meta Platform Inc. for its own purposes, such as, for example, improving its own products, creating user profiles, analysing and optimising its own activities, targeting advertisements, over which, however, we have no real influence.

We use remarketing functions available within the Google advertising system provided by the US company Google LLC. When you visit our website, a remarketing cookie from Google is automatically left on your device, which collects information about your activity on our website.
With the information collected in this way, we are able to display advertisements to you within the Google network depending on your behaviour on our website.
For example, if you display a product, this information will be noted by a remarketing cookie, so that we can target you with advertising about that product or any other we deem appropriate.
This advertising will be displayed to you within the Google network when you use the Internet, browse other websites, etc. We emphasise that when using Google Ads, we only use Anonymous Information.
Using Google Ads, we are only able to define the audience groups we would like our ads to reach. On this basis, Google decides when and how it will present our ad to you.
