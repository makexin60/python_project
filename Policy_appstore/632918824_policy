Take control of your privacy.
Online privacy should be accessible to everyone. It starts with a simpler way to exercise your rights.

Turn On
GPC
Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.
Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.
”

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Privacy
Badger
is a
free and open-source
browser extension
for
Google Chrome
,
Mozilla Firefox
,
Edge
,
Brave
,
Opera
, and
Firefox for Android
created by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF).  Its purpose is to promote a balanced approach to
Internet privacy
between consumers and content providers by blocking
advertisements
and
tracking cookies
that do not respect the
Do Not Track
setting in a user's web browser.
[

]
A second purpose, served by free distribution, has been to encourage membership in and donation to the EFF.
[

Description
[
edit
]
The EFF states: "If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared."
[
6
]
Privacy Badger works by detecting the presence of content loaded from third-party domains when you visit a website, then blocking those domains which are determined to be tracking you.
[
7
]
: B4
Controls on the software allow selective blocking of the third-party domains based on user preference.
[
7
]
: B4
Unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger only blocks those ads which come with embedded trackers.
[
4
]
Privacy Badger has been noted as one recommended tool in a set of tools to protect online privacy.
[
8
]
In October 2020, following security disclosures by the Google Security Team, Privacy Badger changed its default behavior. While it would previously learn to block new trackers heuristically after installed, it now defaults to blocking only trackers it already knows from automated testing before release. While it can still be configured to learn heuristically, it is no longer the default option because it can be exploited by third-parties to fingerprint the user based on trackers it blocks.

History
[

]
The
alpha version
was released on 1 May 2014,
[

]
followed by a
beta
on 21 July 2014.
[
10
]
In April 2017, the EFF announced that Privacy Badger had surpassed one million users.
[
11
]
Reception
[
edit
]
Several publications reported on Privacy Badger in May 2014, following its alpha release.
Ian Paul, for
PC World
, mentions that Privacy Badger "only blocks third-party tracking, not first party", and mentions that prevention of
browser fingerprinting
is planned for a future release.
[
12
]
Ars Technica
notes that if an advertiser makes a commitment to respect Do Not Track requests, their cookies will be unblocked from Privacy Badger.
[
13
]
Nathan Willis, writing for
LWN.net
, describes the green, yellow, and red sliders of the Privacy Badger menu as being a "nice visualization aid", making it easy for the user to toggle the trackers on and off, if desired – describing it as much easier to browse through than
ad blocking
add-on interfaces.
[
14
]
Kif Leswing writing for
Gigaom
writes, "Privacy Badger’s
blacklist
is generated through heuristic blocking, which means it gets better the longer it is used", and wrote in May 2014 that Privacy Badger "breaks a lot of websites", but considers it important as it is created by a
nonprofit organization
, and sums it up as "more than good enough".

rewardStyle, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “rewardStyle”, “we”, “our” or “us”) are
a “Data Controller”. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use Personal Information
about you. This Candidate Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process Personal Information about our recruits and job applicants.
This Candidate Privacy Notice is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. This Candidate Privacy Notice also is not intended to replace other notices or disclosures we may provide to you in connection with your application for a job or eventual role in our organization, which will supersede any conflicting disclosures contained in this Candidate Privacy Notice.
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Candidate Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you within the context of you acting as a job applicant. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or reasonably linked to you.
DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
We will follow data protection law and principles, which means that your data will be:
Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.
Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.
Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.
Accurate and kept up to date.
Kept only as long as necessary, per our data retention policy as mentioned in this document, for the purposes we have told you about.
Kept securely.
THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE HOLD ABOUT YOU
In connection with your application for work with us, we will collect, store, and use the following categories of Personal Information
about you:
The information you have provided to us in your resume, curriculum vitae, and cover letter.
The information you have provided on our intake form, including name, title, address, telephone number, personal email address, gender, employment history, qualifications, and work interests.
Any information you may provide to us during the interview and pre-hire processes.
We may also collect, store and use the following “Special Categories” of more sensitive P
ersonal Information:
Information about civil and criminal convictions and offenses.
HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED?
We collect Personal Information about candidates from the following sources:
You, the candidate.
From a variety of recruitment agencies depending on the position.
Third-party applicant tracking systems
Credit reference agency(ies)
(for finance-handling roles)
, from which we collect the following categories of data:
name, email address, date of birth, national insurance number, contact information, address history, and credit report.
Background check provider(s) (for applicable roles), from which we collect the following categories of data: name, email address, date of birth, national insurance number, driver’s license number, address history, and background check report.
Your named referees, from whom we collect the following categories of data: name, dates of employment, employment relationship, and work characteristics.
From third party publicly accessible sources, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and other social media networks where we may collect the following categories of data: name, dates of employment, job titles, employment history, work characteristics, data included on posts that you have posted or shared.
HOW WE WILL USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU  AND LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
We will use the
Personal Information
we collect about you to:
Assess your skills, qualifications, and suitability for the role.
Carry out background and reference checks, where applicable.
Communicate with you about the recruitment process.
Keep records related to our hiring processes.
Comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
It is in our legitimate interest to decide whether to appoint you to the role since it would be beneficial to our business to appoint someone to that role.
We also need to process your personal information to decide whether to enter into a contract of employment with you.
Having received your intake form, resume/CV, and cover letter, we will then process that information to decide whether you meet the basic requirements to be shortlisted for the role. If you do, we will ask you to a phone screen and potentially a behavioral profile to assess whether your application is strong enough to invite you for an interview. If we decide to call you for an interview, we will use the information you provide to us at the interview to decide whether to offer you the position. We will then check your references. If we decide to offer you the position, we will carry out a background check before confirming the role.
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE P
ERSONAL INFORMATION
If you fail to provide information when requested, which is necessary for us to consider your application (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we will not be able to process your application successfully. For example, if we require a background check or references for this role and you fail to provide us with relevant details, we will not be able to take your application further.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND CHECK
Once the offer has been accepted, we will begin our pre-hire process where we will conduct a background check to collect information about criminal convictions if applicable to your role. For finance-handling roles, will conduct a credit history check. We are entitled to carry out the steps in the pre-hire process for certain roles in order to satisfy ourselves that there is nothing in your criminal convictions, civil or credit history which makes you unsuitable for the position offered. For example, if the position requires a high degree of trust and integrity as a result of it involving or relating to customer accounts and customer or company funds, then we would request a basic disclosure of your criminal and credit record information.
We have in place an appropriate policy document and safeguards which we may be
required by law to maintain when processing such data.
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making.
DATA SHARING
We will only share your
Personal Information
with third parties for the purposes of processing your application
.
All our third-party service providers and other entities in the group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your
Personal Information
in line with our policies, if required by applicable law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your
Personal Information
for their own purposes, if required by applicable law. We only permit them to process your
Personal Information
for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions, if required by applicable law.
DATA SECURITY
We have put in place commercially reasonable
security
measures to prevent your
Personal Information
from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
Personal Information
to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need-to-know. They will only process your
Personal Information
on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
DATA RETENTION
We will retain your information for a fixed period, typically on an annual basis for those requisitions closed or filled prior to January 1st of the preceding year. We retain your
Personal Information
for that period so that we can show, in the event of a legal claim, that we have not discriminated against candidates on prohibited grounds and that we have conducted the recruitment exercise in a fair and transparent way. We also retain your
Personal Information
to alert you of future job opportunities that may arise that you may want to consider. After this period, we will securely destroy your
Personal Information
in accordance with our data retention policy.
We have the right to delete personal information and materials you provided to us as part of your application process. We reserve the right to anonymize your personal information so it can no longer be associated with you, and to use such anonymous or de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you.
If you are offered and accept employment, the Personal Information we collected during the application and recruitment process will become part of your employment record, and we may use it in connection with your employment consistent with our Staff Privacy Notice.
RIGHTS OF
ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION  (FOR JOB APPLICANTS LOCATED IN THE UK AND EU ONLY)
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your
Personal Information
(commonly known as a “Data Subject Access Request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
Personal Information
