Additional Information for California Residents
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and share your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the categories of personal information we collect from and about you. The CCPA also requires us to provide the information in the chart below.
Opt Out of Sale/Sharing of Personal Information.
The CCPA puts certain obligations on businesses that “sell” personal information or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Because of how the CCPA defines “sale” and “sharing”, they may include allowing third parties to receive certain information for advertising purposes and related analytics purposes and disclosing personal information to entities that have entered into joint marketing partnerships or joint ventures with us.
You can submit requests to opt-out of processing of personal information for targeted
advertising purposes here: Your Privacy Choices and by emailing us at
hello@sweetgreen.com.  If you transmit a legally recognized browser-based opt out
preference signal from your browser, we recognize such preference as a request to opt-out of processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law.
We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Additional California Privacy Rights.
California residents may make certain requests about
their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in “Your Rights and Choices” section above. In the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information as defined in the CCPA (e.g., log-in information and precise geolocation), we only use or disclose it for disclosed and permitted business purposes. Under the CCPA, there is not a right to limit these uses and disclosures.
Shine the Light
. California Law allows customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We disclose personal information to our joint marketing partners and entities that have entered into joint ventures with us for their own marketing purposes. The categories of personal information we disclose in this way are set forth in the chart above. For more information about these disclosures, you may email us at hello@sweetgreen.com. In your request, you must include the statement “Shine the Light Request" and provide your first and last name and mailing address and certify that you are a California resident. We reserve the right to require additional information to confirm your identity and California residency.

Additional Information for California Residents
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and share your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the categories of personal information we collect from and about you. The CCPA also requires us to provide the information in the chart below.
Opt Out of Sale/Sharing of Personal Information.
The CCPA puts certain obligations on businesses that “sell” personal information or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Because of how the CCPA defines “sale” and “sharing”, they may include allowing third parties to receive certain information for advertising purposes and related analytics purposes and disclosing personal information to entities that have entered into joint marketing partnerships or joint ventures with us.
You can submit requests to opt-out of processing of personal information for targeted
advertising purposes here: Your Privacy Choices and by emailing us at
hello@sweetgreen.com.  If you transmit a legally recognized browser-based opt out
preference signal from your browser, we recognize such preference as a request to opt-out of processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law.
We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
Additional California Privacy Rights.
California residents may make certain requests about
their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in “Your Rights and Choices” section above. In the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information as defined in the CCPA (e.g., log-in information and precise geolocation), we only use or disclose it for disclosed and permitted business purposes. Under the CCPA, there is not a right to limit these uses and disclosures.
Shine the Light
. California Law allows customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We disclose personal information to our joint marketing partners and entities that have entered into joint ventures with us for their own marketing purposes. The categories of personal information we disclose in this way are set forth in the chart above. For more information about these disclosures, you may email us at hello@sweetgreen.com. In your request, you must include the statement “Shine the Light Request" and provide your first and last name and mailing address and certify that you are a California resident. We reserve the right to require additional information to confirm your identity and California residency. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, mail, or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
. Stripe offers a service called "Link," which allows you to create an account and store information for future interactions with Stripe’s Services and Business Users. You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.
Learn More
.
You can also share and save bank account details to your Link account using Stripe’s
Financial Connections
product. When you use Financial Connections, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (such as bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions, and, in some cases, log-in credentials). You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.
Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.
Paying Stripe
. When you purchase goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive your Transaction Data. For instance, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we collect information about the transaction, as well as your contact and payment method details.
Identity/Verification Services
. We offer an identity verification service that automates the comparison of your identity document (such as a driver’s license) with your image (such as a selfie). You can separately consent to us using your biometric data to enhance our verification technology, with the option to revoke your consent at any time.
Learn More
.
More
. For further information about other types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and your engagement with our End User Services, please see the
More ways we collect, use, and share Personal Data
section below.
b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users
Services
. We use and share your Personal Data to provide the End User Services to you, which includes support, personalization (such as language preferences and setting choices), and communication about our End User Services (such as communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, Stripe may use cookies and similar technologies or the data you provide to our Business Users (such as when you input your email address on a Business User’s website) to recognize you and help you use Link when visiting our Business User’s website. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies in Stripe’s
Cookie Policy
.
Our Business Users.
When you use Link to make payments with our Business Users, we share your Personal Data, including name, contact information, payment method details, and Transaction Data with those Business Users.
Learn More
. You can also direct Stripe to share your saved bank account information and identity documents with Business Users you do business with. Once we share your Personal Data with Business Users, we may process that Personal Data as a Data Processor for those Business Users, as detailed in Section 1.2 of this Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of the Business Users’ you do business with for information on how they use the information shared with them.
Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users. When acting as a service provider—also referred to as a Data Processor—for a Business User, we process End Customer Personal Data in accordance with our agreement with the Business User and the Business User's lawful instructions. This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services. If you're an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy of the Business User you're doing business with for its privacy practices, choices, and controls.
We provide more comprehensive information about our collection, use, and sharing of End Customer Personal Data in our
Privacy Center
, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing your Personal Data.

Transaction Data

. Additionally, we may collect information entered into a checkout form even if you opt not to complete the form or transaction with the Business User.

To protect against fraud and determine if somebody is trying to impersonate you, we may cross-verify this data with information about you that we've collected from Business Users, Financial Partners, business affiliates, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources.
