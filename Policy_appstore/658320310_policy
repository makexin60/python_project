10.4.    Severability
You and Tapps agree that if any portion of the Tapps Terms is found
illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective

without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or
jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the terms, which
shall continue to be in full force and effect.
10.5.    Waiver and Modification of the Terms

right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other
instance.
A waiver of any provision of the Tapps Terms will only be valid if
provided in writing and will only be applicable to the specific incident and
occurrence so waived.
