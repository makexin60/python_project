Privacy centre
Our entities
The Howden brand consists of a number of different companies, established across multiple jurisdictions, which need to collect and process personal data about individuals in order to deliver their services. This page contains links to the privacy notices of our UK companies whose products and services are outlined on this website. Some of our UK companies maintain their own websites from where their privacy notices can be accessed, so we have provided details of those websites towards the bottom of this page. We have also explained how the privacy notices of our non-UK companies can be accessed.
Clients
If you are a prospective, current or former client of one of our UK companies, you can select from one of our privacy notices below to understand what types of personal data that company collects, how and why it collects that personal data, which third parties it might share that personal data with, and what your rights are in the event that the company is processing your personal data.
These privacy notices also explain how you can check which names they trade under, as you may be more familiar with these names. The relevant company to you will be that which is named in any questionnaire or proposal form that you complete for us, or that which is named within any client agreement, policy documentation or email that you may receive from us:
