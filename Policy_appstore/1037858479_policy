CHANGE OF PRIVACY POLICY
Saphe reserves the right to change the above privacy policy at any time in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
TRANSFER TO THIRD COUNTRIES
In connection with the processing of your personal data, we transfer data to recipients in the USA, but only to companies that are part of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
We will not transfer your personal data to recipients in the USA or other third countries characterized by the EU Commission as insecure third countries in connection with the processing of personal data.
Should it become relevant to transfer data to insecure third countries at a later date, this will only occur if the company in the respective third country has provided the necessary guarantees that the recipient's level of personal data protection is in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable EU legislation.
The transfers will therefore take place based on one of the following transfer bases:
The recipient is certified to comply with the principles of personal data protection under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
We have entered into standard data protection clauses with the recipient, which, according to the EU Commission, offer sufficient guarantees for the protection of privacy, fundamental rights, and freedoms, as well as for the exercise of associated rights.
YOUR RIGHTS
If you wish to exercise the rights below, you must contact us through the contact information listed at the top of the privacy policy.
We will process and respond to your inquiry as quickly as possible and no later than one month after we have received your inquiry, unless the complexity and scope of the request mean that we cannot respond within one month. In such cases, the response time may be extended to a total of 3 months, according to Article 12 of the GDPR.
A) Right of access
You have the right to access the personal data Saphe A/S processes about you, according to Article 15 of the GDPR. However, access may be limited by considerations of business secrets and/or intellectual property rights.

If we agree with you that the information we process is incorrect or contains errors, we will delete or correct this information as soon as possible.
However, deletion or correction of personal information will not occur if Saphe A/S is legally obligated to retain all or part of your personal data, or if it is necessary to retain this personal data to establish or defend a legal claim. In such cases, Saphe A/S will only retain the information that Saphe A/S is legally obligated or entitled to, and will delete other personal data about you.

You have the right to withdraw your consent to Saphe A/S processing of your personal data in whole or in part at any time, according to Article 7 of the GDPR.

In such cases, Saphe A/S will only retain the information that Saphe A/S is legally obligated to, and will delete other personal data about you. Your withdrawal of consent does not affect the legality of the processing Saphe A/S has carried out until your withdrawal of consent.
If you withdraw your consent to the processing of the data necessary for the use of Saphe, we may be forced to delete all your data, as your profile will not function without the necessary data.

Saphe A/S processing is incorrect, but you do not want your information deleted, only the use of your personal data restricted.
F) Data portability
As our processing of your personal data is based on consent or a contract and our processing is carried out automatically, you have the right to data portability. The right to data portability means that you have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, which you then have the right to transfer to another service provider, according to Article 20 of the GDPR.
