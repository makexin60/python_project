Respecting privacy is a core principle of healthcare research
At IQVIA, we value, protect and defend privacy and the responsible use of information. We believe that better information lies at the heart of a better world, especially in healthcare. It can help increase access to care, improve outcomes and lower costs. We continually work to inform decision-making in medicine, healthcare, science, academia and public policy and expand access to the information and insights that advance global health. As part of this mission, we champion the laws, practices and principles that help our industry handle information about people responsibly with trust and integrity.
Privacy is integral to our operations all over the world
IQVIA operates in more than 100 countries around the world, many of which have data protection and privacy laws and regulations based on similar core principles (e.g., openness, accountability, data quality, security safeguards, etc.). We adhere to those principles globally and augment our practices to abide by local laws and obligations. We employ a wide range of methods, safeguards, controls, governance, and privacy-enhancing technologies in our efforts to meet or exceed what’s required and do what is right.
