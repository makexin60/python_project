LPRA Studio Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
Updated: May 29, 2018
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application LPRA Studio (â€œApplicationâ€) for mobile devices that was created by LPRA Studio. In this policy, â€œLPRA Studioâ€ may also be referred as â€œWeâ€ or â€œUsâ€.
We think that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you use our applications.
By downloading and/or playing our games, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including consenting to LPRA Studio and our advertising partners and services use of your data for interest-based advertising purposes as described in the following sections of this Privacy Policy. Those sections also explain how you can withhold or withdraw your consent to the use of your data for interest-based advertising purposes, purchases, push notifications and local notifications. If you have any other concerns about providing information to us or it being used as described in this Privacy Policy you should not use our applications.
IMPORTANT: We are in the process to change every application to be compliant with the new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulation. We have good hope to have all our applications in the coming days in accordance with the GDPR. If you are using an old app version that doesnâ€™t use our new GDPR regulation interfaces for EU users, and/or are worried about using this app, you should uninstall this app immediately.
What Type of information do we collect?
When you access or use our applications, we may collect information automatically from your device and/or about you by using the following information such as persistent Identifier (IP address, device identifiers, ad identifiers, bundle ID, language ID, operating system version, device model, country and Mac Address) and your year of birth under applicable data protection laws.
To comply with local laws, we may need to collect your IP address to help us determine your country of residence. In that case, your IP address may be sent to a server that we control, for evaluation purposes, but will not be stored or further processed. We also use your device settings to determine the country where you are located as a way to respect privacy laws specific to your location. We do not collect your precise location, at a level more granular than your city, without your explicit consent.
How the information are collected and how are they used?
When you access or use our applications, we use all kinds of information made available by your device (passively), yourself (actively) or by services which are used for :
1. Age Verification
Applicable when you are from the United States or a European Citizen to identify if you are a child or an adult for data protection and to determine the legal requirements for the processing of your data. We use â€œLocal Storageâ€ which will allow us to enable automatic activation of certain features related to the application. Your year of birth, last access time and Interest-based ads setting are only stored on your device and not on our server.
2. We Collect Your Consent For
European Union Citizens Only:
LPRA Studio works with advertising partners that may collect information from you as part of their process of serving advertisements in our products. If you are a resident of an EU country and give your consent in accordance of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), we will share mobile identifiers (Advertising id and App Name) to personalize content and ads through a third party (Google Admob) on our app. We will also share your Advertising ID with our partner Pubmetric. You can see how and why in our section below.
- To get your mobile ad identifier.
- To remember your settings inside the application.
- It helps us to give you a better experience by finding bugs and crashes in our apps.
When we ask for your consent to personalize your ads and content, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal. To change your consent status, please visit the content setting banner on the cover of the game. You will be able to change your consent by disabling personalized ads.
If you are a resident of an EU country and indicate that you are below the age of 16, you will be served non-personalized ads and the advertising companies will not collect personal information from you.
3. Advertisement
When applicable, we show interest-based ads or contextual ads. Advertising services use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to collect data and show you interest-based ads. They are based on previously collected or historical data to determine or influence ad selection. If you disable that option, ads will not use mobile ad identifier for ad targeting, they will still however use mobile ad identifier for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse. Advertising Identifiers are non-permanent and can be limited or reset (see how to limit or opt-out from our Advertising Partners and What are my opt-out rights sections below).
4. Purchases
When you download our applications, they may be offered for free and content may be purchased for real money inside our applications through Apple App Store and Google Play Store. When you purchase In-app, you generally provide (a) your name, email address, age, user name, password and other registration information; (b) transaction-related information, such as when you make purchases, respond to any offers, or download or use applications from us; (c) information you provide us when you contact us for help; (d) credit card information for purchase and use of the application, and; (e) information you enter through our providers (Apple and Play Store) when using the application, such as contact information and project management information.

Push Notifications & Local Notifications

Children Privacy
Our applications are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect, and do not wish to collect, information about children. As per our Privacy Policy, we will never require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in our application. In order to comply with the legislations (GDPR, COPPA or any others), you may see an age verification screen, when launching an application and a parental verification screen. When this age verification screen will be presented, it is important that you state the correct age. As mentioned above, our applications store the year of birth on your device only, this way we know if you have identified yourself.
Based on your age information and your device settings, LPRA Studio does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisements and remarketing advertisements. If you believe that we might have and/or process any information from or about a child under the age prescribed by the legislation in your country, you always have the possibility to contact us to myapps36@yahoo.com. We will take all reasonable steps to contact our partners and delete the information as soon as possible.
Transfer Data to third countries
We may transfer, in certain circumstances, your personal data collected about you in the United States or any other countries in which LPRA Studio, its business partners, or third party agents operate. By using our products, you consent that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.
We only transfer personal data to entities in third countries that have provided appropriate safeguards to ensure that their level of data protection is in agreement with this privacy policy and applicable law.
Therefore, the transfers will only take place based on the following safeguards:
â€¢ If the entity is certified to comply with the principles for data protection under the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework ("Privacy Shield") (you can view the entities certified under Privacy Shield at www.privacyshield.gov), or
â€¢ If we have entered into standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission with the entity, which is deemed to offer sufficient safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our applications. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for the information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
Your rights
To exercise your data related rights, contact us at myapps36@yahoo.com.
The procedure consists of processing and answering without undue delay and in any event within one month unless a longer period is required due to the complexity of your request, in that case we are allowed to extend it for two additional months.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
