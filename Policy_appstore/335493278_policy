Stratospherix Privacy Policy
Thank you for using our apps. Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our apps and services.
When you use our applications
None of your app configuration or files or data are sent to any server owned by or controlled by Stratospherix Limited.
If you have opted to send diagnostics information about the app to Apple by enabling the Settings/Privacy/Diagnostics & Usage "Automatically Send" option, anonymous aggregated usage counters and diagnostic information is available to us. No personal information is included.
If you use our apps to create connections to cloud storage providers (for example Google GDrive) you will need to grant the app full access to your GDrive files. The app can be used to read, write and delete GDrive content. Local copies of files can be made if you wish. None of this data is shared with Stratospherix.
