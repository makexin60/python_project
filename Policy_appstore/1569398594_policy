1. WHO ARE WE AND WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA ?

The company Automata France operates under the commercial name "VANCELIAN".
Its main activity is the development and management of all systems, software, technical solutions, websites, platforms, and applications, as well as the acquisition, subscription, holding, management, and transfer, in any form, of all shares and securities in all companies or legal entities. In this context, it also operates as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) and is registered with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) under the registration number E2023-087.
The company operates the website accessible to the public at the following URL (hereinafter referred to as the "Site"):
https://www.vancelian.com
. This Site aims to:
Provide users with information to discover the company's activities and services offered, as well as its news (events, publications, etc.);
Offer features and/or information that allow users to contact the company and present the services offered by the company, the projects completed by it and those upcoming, or the team working on these projects;
Provide users with an online account and various associated services as detailed within our general terms and conditions :
https://www.vancelian.com/terms-conditions-vancelian-platform/
The company also administers pages that showcase its activities and allow it to publish content on social networks and interact with internet users (notably on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn).
During your navigation and interactions on the Site, on the pages managed by the company on social networks, or, more generally, during your interactions or exchanges with the company, it may collect and process Personal Data concerning you, for the management of the activities it carries out and on its own behalf, in its capacity as Data Controller, whether you are a customer, prospect, contact, internet user, candidate, supplier, service provider, or partner, potential or current (also referred to as "you" or "the concerned Person(s)" or "user(s)" in this policy).
In this context, the company applies the principles defined by legal and regulatory provisions in the field of Personal Data protection, particularly in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data (General Data Protection Regulation, "GDPR"), as well as the law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files, and Civil Liberties (known as the "Information Technology and Liberties Law") and its implementing decrees.
2. WHAT ARE THE METHODS FOR COLLECTING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ?
2.1     Your Personal Data is collected either directly from you or indirectly from third parties.
2.1.1     Indeed, your Personal Data is particularly collected or processed in whole or in part during your navigation on the Site, your interactions with the Site, and when you enter information into data collection forms that may be present there, but also more generally within the framework of requests that you may send to the company by any means at your convenience, your relationship and your exchanges with the company, and when you share content from the Site using "share buttons" on social networks that may be offered on our Site, or during your navigation on one of the company's pages on social networks.
Generally, your Personal Data is thus directly collected from you in the aforementioned cases.
2.1.2     However, your Personal Data may also be collected through third parties (i.e. indirect collection from third parties).
Indeed, the Personal Data that we collect and process about you may possibly be gathered or enriched by us, particularly for the purpose of conducting commercial operations, communication, solicitation, prospecting, or marketing, using other sources of information (social networks, so-called "public" information, websites, file rentals, etc.).
Similarly, your Personal Data may be transmitted to us by other staff members/contacts within your company or through third parties in certain situations.
Moreover, specifically concerning Personal Data processed in the context of our recruitment operations (for employment or an internship), we use the information you provide us (e.g., form completed for this purpose or generally information mentioned in your CV) that we integrate into our candidate database (CV library). However, we may also approach third parties (for example, recruitment agencies, previous employers, internship supervisors, or clients with whom you have worked on previous missions) or use other sources of information (in particular professional social networks, recruitment firms, or specialized recruitment websites) to collect information about you for the evaluation of your application or your professional profile. Furthermore, even without a candidacy from you, we may, particularly in the context of our monitoring and active search for professional profiles that may match our job vacancies, collect Personal Data from third parties (for example, recruitment agencies or "headhunters") or use other sources of information (in particular professional social networks or specialized recruitment websites) to collect information about you with the aim of proposing that you apply for one of our job offers.
2.2     Furthermore, in general, you are informed that as a principle:
if the Processing of your Personal Data is necessary for compliance with our legal or regulatory obligations, the collection of said Data is mandatory;
if the Processing of your Personal Data is subject to your consent, the communication of said Data to us is entirely optional (it being specified that the lack of communication could, however, prevent us from implementing the concerned Processing at least in certain cases);
if the Processing of your Personal Data is necessary for the execution of a contract or pre-contractual measures taken at your request, the communication of said Data is necessary for pursuing this purpose, and the company could, in the absence of communication of these Data, be prevented from performing its contractual obligations or the aforementioned pre-contractual measures;
if the Processing of your Personal Data is based on the pursuit of our legitimate interests, the communication of said Data is necessary for pursuing this purpose, and the lack of communication of your Data could prevent us from implementing the concerned Processing or hinder it. For example, without the provision of information that would be necessary to respond to a request from you (request for information, etc.), your request related to this collection of Personal Data might not be able to be processed or its processing delayed.
Special case: if data collection forms for Personal Data (for example, forms integrated on the Site or within our pages on social networks, or any data collection form in whatever format that we might make available to you to collect information about you) involve the entry of mandatory Personal Data for the implementation of the associated Processing, you will be informed on the form and it will be specified the possible consequences of a failure to communicate these details. Otherwise, the requested information is optional. In the absence of a specific form, the mandatory data for the pursued purposes will be indicated to you, it being specified that data not indicated as mandatory is, of course, optional.
2.3     Apart from specific legal obligations, or contrary details in this policy, we do not collect "special" Personal Data, that is, data that would reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, nor genetic data, nor data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
2.4     Personal Data of minors or protected adults: we only offer our services to adults with legal capacity. Therefore, in general, the use of the Site and the company's dedicated pages on social networks is reserved for adults with legal capacity, the company cannot in any case be
held liable for the use of the Site or its pages on social networks by minors or those who lack legal capacity, and therefore for any consequences that may result from this, particularly in terms of the Processing of their Personal Data.
3. WHAT DATA IS COLLECTED, FOR WHAT PROCESSING PURPOSES, AND FOR WHAT DURATIONS ?
3.1     Management, processing, and monitoring of information requests and exchanges with our users, via or through the Site or the company's social media pages, or by any other means, and more generally the company's relations with its contacts in a broad sense
We may collect, use, store, and transfer different types of Personal Data about you as follows:
Identity Data.

For your information, we also collect, use, and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.

For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of the application. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

In order to comply with the various legal or regulatory obligations that may be incumbent upon us (including accounting, tax, administrative obligations, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (KYC and/or KYT), etc.) resulting from the execution of contracts for which we are a party and more generally from our activity, we process the Personal Data of our contacts (including but not limited to our clients, investors, partners, etc.) for the pursuit of this purpose, but also for the monitoring of our accounting and financial and budgetary situation (including particularly general and analytical accounting, representation and monitoring of asset fluctuations, or the determination of our financial and budgetary position, etc.).

Use of Your Personal Data
When the processing of personal data is carried out on behalf of the Company, we enter into a separate contract with the processor regarding this processing. This contract constitutes a commitment to GDPR compliance and provides adequate contractual guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, which ensure the protection of your rights.
Regarding the transfer of personal data to recipients outside our corporate group, we only transmit data to third parties when required by law, necessary for the performance of the contract, or when you have consented to the transfer. Under these conditions, the third-party recipients of personal data may include:
Public authorities and institutions (for example, Organismo Agenti e Mediatori, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, European Central Bank, Financial Authorities, or Law Enforcement Agencies). More information is available on institutional websites.
Other credit and financial services institutions or similar entities, to whom we transmit personal data necessary for the performance and processing of business relations.
Other companies within our group for risk control due to legal or official obligations.
Service providers processing personal data on behalf of our company. These may be service providers who offer services on our behalf, such as identity verification services, web hosting, data analysis, marketing services, information technology and related infrastructure services, customer service, email delivery, and audit services. These service providers may need access to personal data to perform their services.
We authorize these service providers to use or disclose personal data only to provide services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. We contractually require these service providers to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data they process on our behalf. Our service providers acting as processors are primarily based within the EU..
7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA), so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
When we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing the following safeguard: when we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For more details, see European Commission: Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
8. DATA SECURITY
We recognize the importance of protecting and managing your personal data. All personal data that we process is treated with the utmost care and security. This section outlines some of the security measures we have put in place.
We use a range of physical and technical measures to ensure the security of your personal data and to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure:
Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems with control over information access by physical and electronic means,
Our staff receives training on data protection and information security,
We have detailed our policy on data security and protection which staff is required to follow when processing your personal data.
Although we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is protected against unauthorized access, we cannot guarantee that it will be secure during transmission by you to our application, our website, or other services. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all your personal data is protected against unauthorized access and is aligned with our privacy policy.
As no system can be considered 100% secure, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal data you provide to us.
All payment transactions made by us or by the third-party payment processing service provider we have chosen will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. When we have given you (or when you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website or App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share your personal data or password with anyone.
9. DATA RETENTION
The law requires us to retain basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial, and Transaction data) for ten years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In certain conditions, you can ask us to erase your data: see Your rights below for further information.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
10. YOUR RIGHTS
In certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:
Right to withdraw consent,
Right of access,
Right to rectification,
Right to erasure,
Right to restrict processing,
Right to object, and
Right to data portability.
Please note: the exercise of these rights is nevertheless limited with respect to Personal Data that would be necessary for the operation of said blockchains (cf. notably the Data retained/stored within the blockchains used in the management, monitoring, and processing of digital asset operations). Indeed, these Data necessary for the operation of the blockchains are neither modifiable nor erasable for the life of the concerned blockchain. Moreover, the retention/storage of these Data in said blockchains is not the responsibility of Automata France which neither manages nor controls said blockchains, and therefore has no power of determination nor control over the Processing of Personal Data that may be implemented within said blockchains, nor to reflect the exercise by the concerned Persons of their rights with respect to said blockchains.
For any other request, you can contact us:
by mail: 240 rue Evariste Galois, 06410, Biot, Sophia Antipolis
by Email:
mydata@vancelian.com
In any case, in the event of reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person submitting such a request to exercise their rights, the company may always request that additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the Concerned Person be provided and may request, where the situation requires it, a photocopy of an identity document bearing the holder's signature. In such a case, the aforementioned response times will be suspended pending receipt of the necessary additional information to identify the Concerned Person.
In the event of receiving such a request, it will be answered as soon as possible and in any event within a maximum period of one month from receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests received, in which case the requester will be informed.
The request may be submitted by the Data Subject or by a person specially authorized for this purpose by the Data Subject, provided that the authorized person justifies their own identity and that of the principal, the authorization itself, as well as its specific duration and purpose. The authorization must also specify whether the authorized agent can receive the response.
Furthermore, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (in France, this is the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty known as "CNIL": 3 Place de Fontenoy - TSA 80715 – 75334 Paris cedex 07; tel.: 01 53 73 22 22) if you believe that the processing of your Personal Data is not carried out in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions concerning the protection of Personal Data.
To understand your rights, you may also refer to the explanations provided by the CNIL here: https://www.cnil.fr/fr/les-droits-pour-maitriser-vos-donnees-personnelles.

2. WHAT ARE THE METHODS FOR COLLECTING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ?
2.1     Your Personal Data is collected either directly from you or indirectly from third parties.

Generally, your Personal Data is thus directly collected from you in the aforementioned cases.
2.1.2     However, your Personal Data may also be collected through third parties (i.e. indirect collection from third parties).
Indeed, the Personal Data that we collect and process about you may possibly be gathered or enriched by us, particularly for the purpose of conducting commercial operations, communication, solicitation, prospecting, or marketing, using other sources of information (social networks, so-called "public" information, websites, file rentals, etc.).
Similarly, your Personal Data may be transmitted to us by other staff members/contacts within your company or through third parties in certain situations.
Moreover, specifically concerning Personal Data processed in the context of our recruitment operations (for employment or an internship), we use the information you provide us (e.g., form completed for this purpose or generally information mentioned in your CV) that we integrate into our candidate database (CV library). However, we may also approach third parties (for example, recruitment agencies, previous employers, internship supervisors, or clients with whom you have worked on previous missions) or use other sources of information (in particular professional social networks, recruitment firms, or specialized recruitment websites) to collect information about you for the evaluation of your application or your professional profile. Furthermore, even without a candidacy from you, we may, particularly in the context of our monitoring and active search for professional profiles that may match our job vacancies, collect Personal Data from third parties (for example, recruitment agencies or "headhunters") or use other sources of information (in particular professional social networks or specialized recruitment websites) to collect information about you with the aim of proposing that you apply for one of our job offers.
2.2     Furthermore, in general, you are informed that as a principle:
if the Processing of your Personal Data is necessary for compliance with our legal or regulatory obligations, the collection of said Data is mandatory;
if the Processing of your Personal Data is subject to your consent, the communication of said Data to us is entirely optional (it being specified that the lack of communication could, however, prevent us from implementing the concerned Processing at least in certain cases);
if the Processing of your Personal Data is necessary for the execution of a contract or pre-contractual measures taken at your request, the communication of said Data is necessary for pursuing this purpose, and the company could, in the absence of communication of these Data, be prevented from performing its contractual obligations or the aforementioned pre-contractual measures;
if the Processing of your Personal Data is based on the pursuit of our legitimate interests, the communication of said Data is necessary for pursuing this purpose, and the lack of communication of your Data could prevent us from implementing the concerned Processing or hinder it. For example, without the provision of information that would be necessary to respond to a request from you (request for information, etc.), your request related to this collection of Personal Data might not be able to be processed or its processing delayed.
Special case: if data collection forms for Personal Data (for example, forms integrated on the Site or within our pages on social networks, or any data collection form in whatever format that we might make available to you to collect information about you) involve the entry of mandatory Personal Data for the implementation of the associated Processing, you will be informed on the form and it will be specified the possible consequences of a failure to communicate these details. Otherwise, the requested information is optional. In the absence of a specific form, the mandatory data for the pursued purposes will be indicated to you, it being specified that data not indicated as mandatory is, of course, optional.
2.3     Apart from specific legal obligations, or contrary details in this policy, we do not collect "special" Personal Data, that is, data that would reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, nor genetic data, nor data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
2.4     Personal Data of minors or protected adults: we only offer our services to adults with legal capacity. Therefore, in general, the use of the Site and the company's dedicated pages on social networks is reserved for adults with legal capacity, the company cannot in any case be
held liable for the use of the Site or its pages on social networks by minors or those who lack legal capacity, and therefore for any consequences that may result from this, particularly in terms of the Processing of their Personal Data.

Use of Your Personal Data
When the processing of personal data is carried out on behalf of the Company, we enter into a separate contract with the processor regarding this processing. This contract constitutes a commitment to GDPR compliance and provides adequate contractual guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, which ensure the protection of your rights.
Regarding the transfer of personal data to recipients outside our corporate group, we only transmit data to third parties when required by law, necessary for the performance of the contract, or when you have consented to the transfer. Under these conditions, the third-party recipients of personal data may include:
Public authorities and institutions (for example, Organismo Agenti e Mediatori, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, European Central Bank, Financial Authorities, or Law Enforcement Agencies). More information is available on institutional websites.
Other credit and financial services institutions or similar entities, to whom we transmit personal data necessary for the performance and processing of business relations.
Other companies within our group for risk control due to legal or official obligations.
Service providers processing personal data on behalf of our company. These may be service providers who offer services on our behalf, such as identity verification services, web hosting, data analysis, marketing services, information technology and related infrastructure services, customer service, email delivery, and audit services. These service providers may need access to personal data to perform their services.
We authorize these service providers to use or disclose personal data only to provide services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. We contractually require these service providers to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data they process on our behalf. Our service providers acting as processors are primarily based within the EU..
7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA), so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
When we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing the following safeguard: when we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For more details, see European Commission: Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
8. DATA SECURITY
We recognize the importance of protecting and managing your personal data. All personal data that we process is treated with the utmost care and security. This section outlines some of the security measures we have put in place.
We use a range of physical and technical measures to ensure the security of your personal data and to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure:
Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems with control over information access by physical and electronic means,
Our staff receives training on data protection and information security,
We have detailed our policy on data security and protection which staff is required to follow when processing your personal data.
Although we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is protected against unauthorized access, we cannot guarantee that it will be secure during transmission by you to our application, our website, or other services. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all your personal data is protected against unauthorized access and is aligned with our privacy policy.
As no system can be considered 100% secure, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal data you provide to us.
All payment transactions made by us or by the third-party payment processing service provider we have chosen will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. When we have given you (or when you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website or App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share your personal data or password with anyone.
9. DATA RETENTION
The law requires us to retain basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial, and Transaction data) for ten years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In certain conditions, you can ask us to erase your data: see Your rights below for further information.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
10. YOUR RIGHTS
In certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:
Right to withdraw consent,
Right of access,
Right to rectification,
Right to erasure,
Right to restrict processing,
Right to object, and
Right to data portability.
Please note: the exercise of these rights is nevertheless limited with respect to Personal Data that would be necessary for the operation of said blockchains (cf. notably the Data retained/stored within the blockchains used in the management, monitoring, and processing of digital asset operations). Indeed, these Data necessary for the operation of the blockchains are neither modifiable nor erasable for the life of the concerned blockchain. Moreover, the retention/storage of these Data in said blockchains is not the responsibility of Automata France which neither manages nor controls said blockchains, and therefore has no power of determination nor control over the Processing of Personal Data that may be implemented within said blockchains, nor to reflect the exercise by the concerned Persons of their rights with respect to said blockchains.

In any case, in the event of reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person submitting such a request to exercise their rights, the company may always request that additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the Concerned Person be provided and may request, where the situation requires it, a photocopy of an identity document bearing the holder's signature. In such a case, the aforementioned response times will be suspended pending receipt of the necessary additional information to identify the Concerned Person.
In the event of receiving such a request, it will be answered as soon as possible and in any event within a maximum period of one month from receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests received, in which case the requester will be informed.
The request may be submitted by the Data Subject or by a person specially authorized for this purpose by the Data Subject, provided that the authorized person justifies their own identity and that of the principal, the authorization itself, as well as its specific duration and purpose. The authorization must also specify whether the authorized agent can receive the response.
Furthermore, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (in France, this is the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty known as "CNIL": 3 Place de Fontenoy - TSA 80715 – 75334 Paris cedex 07; tel.: 01 53 73 22 22) if you believe that the processing of your Personal Data is not carried out in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions concerning the protection of Personal Data.
To understand your rights, you may also refer to the explanations provided by the CNIL here: https://www.cnil.fr/fr/les-droits-pour-maitriser-vos-donnees-personnelles.
