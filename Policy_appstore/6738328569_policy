Privacy Policy - aikiss.app
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help
			you understand how aikiss.app deals with the personal identifiable information ('PII') you may occasionally provide
			to us via Internet (the 'Google Play' Platform).
Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download our Android
			applications. To be specific, we do not require the consumers to get registered before downloading the
			application, nor do we keep track of the consumers' visits of our application, we even don't have a Server to
			store such PII.
The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you personally decide to email
			us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation are strictly
			limited to your name, email address and your survey response only.
In above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used for contacting you and
			improving our services. We will never use such information (e.g. your name and email address) for any other
			purposes, such as to further market our products, or to disclose your personal information to a third party for
			commercial gains.
It should be noted that whether or not to send us your feedback or bug report is a
			completely voluntary initiative upon your own decision. If you have concern about your PII being misused, or if
			you want further information about our privacy policy and what it means, please feel free to email us at
			info@aikiss.app, we will endeavor to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner.
Face Data Collection and Usage
Our app includes features that utilize face data for video processing purposes. We want to be fully transparent about how we handle this sensitive information:
Data Retention:
We explicitly confirm that we do not retain face data beyond the immediate video processing needs. All face data is automatically and permanently deleted immediately after the video processing is completed.
Purpose of Collection:
We collect face data solely for the purpose of providing our video processing features. This data is used temporarily to create the video effects you request through our app.
Storage Duration:
Face data is stored only for the duration of the video processing operation, which typically takes a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the complexity of the effect. This temporary storage is necessary to complete the video processing task you've requested.
Third-Party Sharing:
We share face data only with our video processing provider, Luma API. This sharing is necessary to process your video and create the effects you've requested.
Reason for Third-Party Sharing:
Luma API provides essential video processing capabilities that enable our app's core features. Sharing face data with them is necessary to create the video effects you request.
Third-Party Data Practices:
Luma API's privacy practices align with our commitment to user privacy. They process face data only for the duration of the video processing task and do not store face data beyond the immediate processing needs. Their temporary storage of face data is limited to the processing time required to complete your video effect request, typically a matter of minutes. This brief storage period is necessary to ensure proper video processing and effect application.
