Thanks for choosing Moises!

So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.
That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.
2. About this Policy
This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Moises Systems Inc. The Policy applies to all Moises services and any associated services (referred to as the 'Moises Service’). The terms governing your use of the Moises Service are defined in our

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any material change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information or additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.
The aim of this Policy is to:
Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the Moises Service; and
Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.
We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For further clarification of the terms used in this Policy please visit our help center. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please go to help.moises.ai. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the Moises Service.
3. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control
The General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we are happy to offer transparency and access controls to help users take advantage of those rights.

Right to erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
Right to restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
Right to object -
the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
Right to data portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
Right not to be subject to automated decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.

Categories of Recipients
Reason for sharing
Service providers
We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us. These companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Moises Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Moises’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Moises is involved.
Payment processors
We will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, disputes, and for anti-fraud purposes.
Advertising partners
We work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Moises Service. These partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest-based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Moises Service. We and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Moises understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.
Other Moises group companies
We will share your personal data with other Moises group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Moises Service to you.
Law enforcement and data protection authorities
We share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law or respond to valid legal processes, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena. We also share your personal data where we in good faith belief that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, a criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.
Purchasers of our business
We will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer. In this situation, Moises will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
7. Data retention and deletion
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Moises Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Moises Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes. We keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Moises Service. For example, we keep your media and processed files and account information.
If you request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:
If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;
Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law; and/or,
Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.

this link
to open a request; select the option "Account & Login," and on 'Request Type' select "I want to delete my account."
8. Transfer to other countries
Moises shares your personal data globally with Moises group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy. Moises may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country. Your personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.
Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland. In such instances, Moises shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organizational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.
9. Links
We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Moises Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.
10. Keeping your personal data safe
We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.
Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Moises account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Moises Service.
11. Children
Moises Service is not directed to humans under the age of 13 years. The Moises Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from humans under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”). If you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Moises Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.
If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Moises, please contact us using the form at help.moises.ai.
If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a human under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Moises account for that person.
12. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Moises Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification. We may notify you in advance.
Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.
