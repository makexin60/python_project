Cookie Policy
Introduction
Your privacy is extremely important to us.
With this objective always present in everything we do, we have prepared
    this Cookie Policy so that you can find out what cookies we use on the
    Parfois' digital platforms, for how long, for what purpose and how you can
    manage them.
This Cookies Policy is part of our privacy policy, which
    you can
read here
This Cookies Policy aims to inform you, as a user of our digital platforms,
    that we use cookies in order to offer you an optimal browsing experience
    that is smooth and tailored to your needs.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device by
    your internet browser during a visit to a digital platform for the purposes
    of storing, retrieving or updating data.
Cookies allow the digital platform to record the user's browsing habits in
    order to offer you optimised and personalised browsing according to your
    preferences.
Cookies may collect the following data from users: IP address, browser type,
    device type, location, language, operating system, user ID and browsing
    history.
What kind of cookies do we use on the Parfois website?
The Parfois website uses several types of cookies. As for duration, we use
    cookies of two types:
Session cookies: are temporary cookies that remain stored in the
        browser until the user leaves the website, so that no record is left on
        the user's hard drive. The information collected by these cookies is
        used to analyse website traffic patterns, which allows us to improve the
        content and navigability of the website.
Permanent cookies: these cookies are stored in your browser
        and are used when you return to our website.
Functions of the cookies used by Parfois:
Cookies required: These cookies are necessary for the proper
        operation of the website, allowing correct navigation and the
        functioning of the applications that form the website.
Functional cookies: functional cookies allow websites to
        remember the preferences and choices a user makes on the website,
        including username, region and language, in order to personalise the
        website and improve the browsing experience.
Analytical cookies: These allow us to perform a statistical analysis of
        how users use the website. We examine browsing on our website in order
        to improve the services we make available to you.
Advertising cookies: They target advertising according to the
        interests of each user, so as to tailor advertising and marketing
        campaigns to users' interests, helping to measure the effectiveness of
        advertising and the success of the website.
Access to Cookies
Parfois uses its own cookies, i.e., cookies installed by us, as well as,
    third-party cookies that are installed and managed by third parties, so
    these third parties may have access to the data collected by such cookies.
