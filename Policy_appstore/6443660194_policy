Email Contact. On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child through our apps, GoKids! may receive or need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. GoKids! will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.
Photos, Videos, and Audio. Our Apps may request access to the device’s photo album, or microphone in order to provide in-game functionality. For example, a child may say anything microphone in order to imitate call with the animals or save their drawing to their local device. GoKids! does not store or share any photos, images or audio files that contain children’s images or voices through our Apps. All photos, and audio files are stored locally on the device only.
Persistent Identifiers. GoKids! collects, uses and shares persistent identifiers, such as device identifiers or IP addresses, through our Apps solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Apps or as otherwise permitted by COPPA. This information may be collected by GoKids! or a third party providing a service to GoKids!.
In-App Advertising. Some of our Apps incorporate advertising serving technology offered by our third party service providers, which enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while the user plays. The data collected for this purpose may include persistent identifiers solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Child Directed App as permitted by COPPA, such as allowing our third party service providers to calculate the number of views, cap the frequency of ads and serve ads in a format that fits the device. Please note that while our Apps may contain advertisements about GoKids! or third party products and services, we prohibit behavioral advertising to children in our Apps or through data collected from our Apps.

We may also seek verifiable parental consent as necessary to comply with COPPA. In either case, we will not collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to participate in our Apps.
Security

We retain children’s personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.
Children’s Privacy

This information is for internal operations only and can’t be shared. It’s just for us to help us improve our services for you.
When you use our Apps we may display contextual advertisements to you. In order to enable advertising we allow our advertising partners to collect online identifiers (such as Advertising ID on Android and IDFA on iOS) that might be considered as personal information under some legislations, but they should use it solely for the purposes of contextual advertising. For any other purposes they should use the information solely on anonymized and aggregated basis.

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 4 main services:
Ad Network
– A platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
Mediation Platform
– A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, “third party” ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Analytics Platform –
A platform that allows app developers to receive insights on their apps.
Ad Quality Platform
–
A platform that allows app developers to monitor advertising content displayed within their apps.
In addition, as of November 2022, Unity Technologies has been added as a corporate affiliate of ironSource Mobile Ltd. To view Unity’s privacy policy, please click

We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly
– through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly
– through other third party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version,  the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information).

How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization and frequency capping: We use Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.

Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.
Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.

Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Analytics Platform in order to allow them to better understand the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Analytics Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Quality for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.

We will only process a User’s data for the purposes for which we originally intended, unless we reasonably consider that we need to process it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
For an explanation of how the processing of your data for a new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
User consent
We may process a User’s data without their knowledge or consent, in compliance with the rules in
Our right to process Users’ data
, where this is required or permitted by law.
4. What do we do with End Users’ data?
An
End User
is a person, typically a child, who uses a website or mobile application on which an Ad is delivered using AwesomeAds Marketplace.
How do we safeguard children’s privacy?
AwesomeAds Marketplace enables publishers to receive Ads secure in the knowledge that their users – including children – are protected from the risks associated with online profiling and interest-based targeting, and that they (the publishers) are serving Ads in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K.
AwesomeAds Marketplace does this by deploying a proprietary process specifically designed to minimise our interaction with End User data, and to prevent such interaction by third parties involved in delivering Ads. This process entails the use of de-identified data when delivering Ads and monitoring their performance. For more information, see
How do we process End Users’ data?
All Ads delivered by AwesomeAds Marketplace carry the SuperAwesome ‘SAFE AD’ watermark:
The watermark signifies that delivery of the Ad involves no cookie-based targeting or behavioural tracking – in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K – and each Ad creative has been reviewed for compliance with SuperAwesome’s advertising policies.
COPPA-compliant contextual targeting technology
AwesomeAds Marketplace’s proprietary contextual targeting technology is certified under the following COPPA Safe Harbor Programs approved by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC):
the kidSAFE Seal Program:
the ESRB Privacy Certified Program:
the CARU COPPA Safe Harbor Program:
The COPPA Safe Harbor Programs do not certify individual ads or ad campaigns.
The COPPA Safe Harbor Programs monitor and audit the AwesomeAds Marketplace contextual targeting technology for compliance with COPPA.
What End User data do we process?
The data we process from End Users is limited to specific technical data relating to the device on which the End User is viewing and engaging with an Ad served by AwesomeAds Marketplace. We refer to this data as
Device Data
.
Device Data
is defined as follows:
If an End User sees the Ad on a
mobile app
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the app’s BundleID (e.g. “com.acme.bestgamever”) from the End User’s mobile device
If an End User sees the Ad on a
web browser
, their Device Data consists of the device’s user agent string, IP address and the site’s web domain address (e.g. “www.website.com”) where the Ad is shown
If an End User interacts with an Ad that includes augmented reality features, Device Data will include device type (e.g. phone or tablet) and browser information. We will ask for permission to access the device camera to enable a filter or overlay, but do not collect or share any images captured by the End User’s device.
How do we process End Users’ data?
The only End Users’ data we process is Device Data. In all cases we are strong advocates of data minimisation with regard to Device Data – even if some of that data is not personal data.
We process End Users’ Device Data as follows:
We generate a de-identified Marker
We observe the Device Data momentarily, and only in order to immediately transform it into a temporary custom identifier called a
Marker
. A Marker is a temporary, unique, one-way hashed value that cannot be reverse engineered to identify a particular individual.
Our Marker was designed specifically to enable AwesomeAds Marketplace to deliver Ads without SuperAwesome or any third party storing the personal data of End Users, which could be used to build online profiles for behavioural advertising, or other purposes that are not in compliance with data privacy laws regarding children.
By using a Marker, we do not need to retain or process Device Data in its original form.
To create the Marker:
We obfuscate the Device Data by injecting randomised characters into it and then run the resultant string through an algorithm which creates the Marker
The Device Data is not stored by SuperAwesome and is used only within the SDK
We discard the Marker when each Ad campaign has ended, or at month end, whichever occurs first
Third party Ad measurement
We may provide limited third-party access to Device Data for Ad measurement purposes, as explained in
How do we share Users’ data?
What is our legal basis for processing End Users’ data?
The following tables outline the purposes for which we may process End Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.

language
device type
web domain
These elements cannot be used to identify an individual.
There is no permanent retention of End Users’ personal data within AwesomeAds Marketplace (or by SuperAwesome). An End Users’ Device Data is observed by us only momentarily, as further explained in
How do we process End Users’ data
? above.
5. What do we do with Authorised Users’ data?
An
Authorised User
is an individual who uses the Dashboard to manage advertising campaigns on behalf of our Customers.
What Authorised User data do we process?
To enable an Authorised User to access the Dashboard, we process their first name, last name, corporate email address, and Dashboard password.
When an Authorised User interacts with the Dashboard, we process technical data about their equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns on the Dashboard. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies.
We process aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data of Authorised Users to monitor and improve the performance and features of the AwesomeAds Marketplace.
What is our legal basis for processing Authorised Users’ data?
This table outlines the purposes for which we may process certain types of Authorised Users’ data, the legal bases we rely on to do so, and what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.
When we process Authorised Users’ data

Necessary for our legitimate interests to operate, maintain and improve AwesomeAds Marketplace
How long do we retain Authorised Users’ data?
SuperAwesome retains personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements or protecting our rights.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Authorised Users’ data, we consider:
the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data
the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the data
the purposes for which we process the data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means
applicable legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements
We only retain the data of Authorised Users for the life of the Customer relationship with SuperAwesome or until deletion is requested either by the Customer or the Authorised User, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
We may retain an Authorised User’s data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with the Customer or the Authorised User.
Marketing
We do not normally send marketing materials to Authorised Users unless they have opted in to receive marketing from SuperAwesome through other channels. From time to time, Authorised Users receive service information updates via the Dashboard.
Cookies
We use Google Analytics on the Dashboard. Google Analytics places a cookie on Authorised Users’ devices. As an Authorised User, you can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.
If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Dashboard may become inaccessible or not function properly.
6. What do we do with general enquiry and subscribers’ data?
When someone enquires about our products or services, subscribes to our service or publications, or gives us feedback, we process the personal data which they have provided (e.g. name and email address) to respond to them.
7. How do we share Users’ data?
Sharing Users’ data with third-party providers
SuperAwesome uses a small number of third-party service providers to help us provide the AwesomeAds Marketplace to Users. Some of these providers may process Users’ data on our behalf.
For example:
We use a third party to host AwesomeAds Marketplace
We use third party tools to help us better understand how Customers and Authorised Users navigate across the Dashboard
We use service providers to support our internal operations, and who may process Device Data to measure the effectiveness of an Ad. For example, to support fraud detection (by determining invalid traffic such as bots), verification of impressions, and measuring how much of an Ad was ‘viewable’
We enter into contractual arrangements with our service providers to ensure that they are only processing your data in a lawful manner and strictly for the foregoing purposes. It may not be used or shared for any other purposes, including for behavioural advertising or to amass a profile on a User.
We maintain a current list of providers
here.
To learn more about how our third-party data processors use Users’ data, please refer to their privacy policies.
Sharing Users’ data within SuperAwesome
We may share a User’s data within the SuperAwesome group of companies and other third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, the new owners may process a User’s data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.
Sharing Users’ data for other reasons
We may disclose a User’s data for any of the following reasons:
in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law
if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process
to permit us to pursue available remedies, including commencing or responding to any claims
to enforce the terms and conditions of AwesomeAds Marketplace
to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SuperAwesome or the public
to prevent other illegal activity
for risk management purposes
8. How do we transfer Users’ data internationally?
We may transfer Users’ data in the following ways:
We share Users’ data within the SuperAwesome group of companies. This involves transferring Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Some of our third-party data processors are based outside the UK and EEA so their processing of Users’ data may involve a transfer of Users’ data outside the UK and EEA.
Whenever we authorise a transfer of Users’ data outside of the UK and EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using specific contracting frameworks approved by the UK Government and European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK and EEA. If you require further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring Users’ data outside of the UK or EEA, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
9. How do we secure Users’ data?
SuperAwesome values your trust and strives to maintain adequate security measures for all areas of our business and our services. Because AwesomeAds Marketplace is a service that operates digitally, SuperAwesome is continuously reviewing and improving its security measures to prevent data breaches and security incidents.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent Users’ data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We limit access to Users’ data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties strictly on a “need to know” basis. They only process Users’ data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Third party websites, services and apps
Some of the correspondence Authorised Users receive from us may contain links to third party websites, online services or mobile applications that are not affiliated with or operated by us, including those of the Customers who use AwesomeAds Marketplace. While SuperAwesome tries to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible and accept no liability for the content, security or privacy practices of those other websites.
To find out how your personal data may be used by third party websites, refer to the privacy and cookie policies displayed on those websites.
10. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your
personal data
. For example, you may have rights to:
Review/access/delete/restrict the collection
of your child’s personal data. Under COPPA, a parent has certain rights over how we handle the personal data of an End User who is their child. This includes the right for a parent to review, access, or delete the personal data that has been collected by us from that End User, and to refuse at any time to permit the collection from that End User of such personal data.
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances, such as where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You may also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons of which you will be notified, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You may also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent as the legal basis upon which to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
privacy@superawesome.com
.
If you are a California resident, please refer to the California residents section below for more information on your legal rights.
No fee usually required
You do not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Do Not Track disclosure
Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (
DNT
) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, AwesomeAds Marketplace does not support and does not act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.
11. Location-specific privacy rules
Depending on where you are resident, specific privacy rules apply:
UK and EEA
If you are concerned that we have not complied with your legal rights or applicable privacy laws, you may contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (www.ico.gov.uk) which is the regulator responsible for data protection in the United Kingdom, where SuperAwesome Trading Limited is registered (Registration number Z8630714). If you are located in the EEA, you may contact your local data protection authority. You can find contact details

the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected
the purposes for which the information was collected or sold

To submit a request, you or an authorized agent may email us at
privacy@superawesome.com
. We will confirm your request, and may ask for additional information as needed to verify your identity or authority.

Verification
Requests for access to or deletion of Personal Information are subject to our ability to reasonably verify your identity considering the information requested and pursuant to relevant CCPA requirements, limitations, and regulations. If we need additional information to verify your identity, we will contact you to request that information.
Right to be free from discrimination
We will not discriminate against you because you have chosen to exercise your rights, including, for example, by denying you access to our online services or charging you different rates or prices for the same online services, unless that difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your data.
Exercising your rights
To submit a request or to otherwise contact us for more information about how to exercise your rights, please follow the instructions above. If you would like to designate an authorised agent to make a request on your behalf, please be sure the agent is able to:
demonstrate you have provided written permission for the agent to submit the request on your behalf
provide proof of their own identity
If the agent does not satisfy both these requirements, we will deny the request.
California residents’ “Shine the Light” law
We do not share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.

If the change is material, we will place a notice on the Privacy Hub by revising the link to read substantially as “Updated Privacy Policy” for a reasonable period of time.

PARENT KIDOZ ACCOUNT
In order to use certain features of the KID Mode App, you as parent will be requested to create a designated Parent KIDOZ Account (“Account”). By creating an Account, you provide your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your child’s Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, and as needed per Product. If at any time you do not want you or your child to be bound by these terms, you must deactivate your Account by emailing your request to:
support@kidoz.net
or uninstalling the App from your mobile device. You represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account details and password, and for any and all activity made under the Account. You represent and warrant that you will not provide inaccurate, misleading or false information to KIDOZ, and that you will provide only your own or your child’s information. Following the creation of your Account, you will be able to access your designated dashboard, activate parental controls to your preference and view certain child usage information (some features will require payment).
During Registration, and subject to applicable legal requirements, the parent will be requested to provide consent to the processing of the child’s Personal Information related to the child’s use of the App (as detailed herein). Following which, a verification email will be sent to the email address provided through registration. The parent will be required to follow the instructions detailed in the verification email and activate the Account within the period defined therein (“Pending Period”). In the event the parent does not activate the Account within the Pending Period, the Account will be blocked until the parent either requests to resend the verification email and subsequently activates the account, or chooses to proceed solely as a guest (meaning, some features will not be available). In this latter case, the parent account and all child profiles under the parent account will be removed from the KIDOZ database and all user activity information previously collected will be deleted and no additional data will be collected for that user.
In either event, following the Pending Period, KIDOZ will cease to collect any information related to the specific user’s use of the App. In addition, in the event the parent does not activate the Account within the given time period even after having requested a new verification email and parent does not choose to proceed as a Guest, in other words, there is no user activity at all for this account, KIDOZ will delete the Personal Information related to the child’s use of the App. The Account will remain Active until either User chooses to use KIDOZ as a Guest or Parent requests to close Account.

Safeguarding Children's Digital Privacy
At Kidoz, we recognize the paramount importance of protecting children’s privacy in the digital world. This white paper outlines our commitment and comprehensive approach to ensuring full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly its provisions for children (GDPR-K). Through our technology, stringent policies, and transparent practices, Kidoz not only meets but exceeds the requirements set forth to safeguard children’s personal data.
Background
The digital landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly when it comes to advertising to children. Compliance with GDPR-K and COPPA is not just a regulatory requirement but a cornerstone of trust between families, brands, and content publishers. Kidoz has risen to this challenge, creating a contextual mobile advertising network that respects privacy while enabling sustainable revenue for app developers.
About Kidoz
Kidoz is a leading provider of child-safe digital advertising solutions. Recognizing the vulnerability of children in the digital ecosystem, we have embedded privacy and safety into the DNA of our services, ensuring a secure and positive online experience for our young users.
Key Provisions and Kidz's Alignment
GDPR-K emphasizes several critical areas: the age of digital consent, data minimization, privacy by design, clear communication, and strict limits on data sharing and marketing. Kidoz adheres to these principles, implementing robust measures to comply with each requirement.
Kidoz's Approach to GDPR-K Compliance
Data Privacy and Protection Policies
Kidoz has developed comprehensive data protection policies that govern every aspect of our operations. From data collection to processing and sharing, we ensure the highest standards of privacy and security. Our policies are regularly reviewed and audited by an official certifier, PRIVO.

Consent Verification
In addressing the essential considerations surrounding the age of digital consent under GDPR-K, Kidoz adopts a universally cautious approach, operating on the principle that
ALL users
within our network are treated as if they are below the age of digital consent.
This policy underscores our steadfast commitment to privacy and safety, ensuring that no personal data is ever shared with third parties.
When responding to advertising requests, Kidoz meticulously removes any personally identifiable information (PII) from the transaction. This rigorous process ensures that every ad served through our network is entirely devoid of personal data, upholding our promise to safeguard user privacy at every turn. By default, we operate with the highest standards of data protection, effectively ensuring that our user base is shielded from any form of data sharing that could compromise their privacy.
Privacy by Design
From the initial stages of product development to each subsequent update, Kidoz integrates privacy by design principles. This approach means that every new feature, service, or product we develop undergoes rigorous privacy impact assessments to identify and mitigate risks to children's data privacy. Our engineering teams are trained to prioritize privacy, ensuring that the default settings for all our services are always set to the highest level of data protection.
Kidoz's Commitment to Clearly Labeled Advertising
Kidoz takes a transparent approach to advertising by distinctly labeling our ads, ensuring they are easily recognized as advertisements and not mistaken for content. This practice is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of our user experience, fostering trust among children, parents, and content publishers alike. By incorporating a clear, consistent watermark across all our advertisements, Kidoz guarantees that users can effortlessly distinguish between entertainment or educational content and promotional material
Ad Platform Innovation
In our pursuit of setting industry benchmarks for responsible and child-friendly digital advertising, Kidoz not only rigorously ensured its advertising platform met stricter GDPR-K compliance standards but also implemented an exhaustive manual review process.
Every campaign and ad creative submitted to our network is meticulously examined by our dedicated in-house team
. This hands-on approach ensures that all advertisements are not only relevant and appropriate for our young audience but also fully compliant with the strictest privacy standards.
Following this manual filtration our system is intricately designed to automatically
filter out any campaign or ad creative that could potentially collect personal information
, such as names, birth dates, email addresses, or locations. This comprehensive review process ensures all advertisements are relevant, appropriate for our young audience, and strictly adhere to privacy regulations. By integrating this dual-layered approach—combining automated safeguards with human oversight—Kidoz underscores its unwavering commitment to creating a secure and nurturing digital environment, completely free of privacy concerns.
