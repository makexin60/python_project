AIPix
Privacy policy
Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our app.
1. Information We Collect
AiPix requires users to upload a face image for processing. The uploaded image is sent to our AI-powered server, where it is transformed into a caricature and applied to the chosen template.
2. How We Use Your Data
The uploaded face image is solely used for the AI transformation process.
The processed image is then displayed in the app for user download or sharing.
3. Data Storage and Retention
Face images are temporarily stored on our servers for processing.
Images are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers within a few minutes after processing is completed.
We do not retain or store user face images beyond the processing duration.
4. Data Sharing
We never share your face images or any other personal data with third parties.
Your images remain private and are not used for any other purposes beyond the AI processing.
5. Security Measures
We take appropriate security measures to protect your data, including encryption and secure server storage. However, while we strive to safeguard your data, no transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure.
6. Your Rights and Choices
Since we do not retain face images beyond the processing time, there is no stored data to access or delete. However, if you have any concerns, feel free to contact us.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app, and your continued use of AiPix will constitute your acceptance of the updated policy.
