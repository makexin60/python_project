When you submit a request to exercise your rights, we need to confirm your identity to ensure that you are not somebody else than who you claim to be.

Below we describe the rights that you have in relation to your personal data. For further information on your rights, please see the website of your supervisory authority. In Sweden, the supervisory authority is the
Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection
(IMY).
Right to access (Article 15 of the GDPR)
You have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether we handle your personal data and, in such case, receive a copy of your personal data together with additional information on our use of your personal data. Please note that the right to a copy of your personal data may not adversely affect the rights of others.
Right to rectification (Article 16 of the GDPR)
You have the right to request that we rectify or supplement your personal data, if you consider that your personal data is incorrect, incomplete, or misleading.
Right to withdraw your consent (Article 7 of the GDPR)
For certain use of your personal data, we rely on your consent. When we use your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to at any time withdraw your consent. When you have withdrawn your consent, we will not continue to use your personal data based on the consent previously provided.
Right to erasure (Article 17 of the GDPR)
You have in certain situations the right to request erasure of your personal data (“
the right to be forgotten
“). Accordingly, the right to erasure is subject to certain conditions. For example, the right to erasure applies if we keep your personal data but no longer for the purposes for which it was collected, if you withdraw your consent which we rely on for our use of your personal data, or if you object to our use of the data and we cannot show a compelling reason to further use it notwithstanding your objection.
There are also several exemptions from the right to erasure, including if we are obligated under law to keep your personal data or if the personal data is needed to exercise, manage, and defend legal claims.
Right to object to our use of personal data (Article 21 of the GDPR)
In certain situations, you have the right to object to our use of your personal data. Where we rely on our or another’s legitimate interest for the use of your personal data, you have the right to object to the use for reasons which relate to your particular situation. If we cannot show a compelling reason to continue to use your personal data, we will stop using your personal data for the relevant purpose.
Right to request restriction of your personal data (Article 18 of the GDPR)
In certain situations, you have the right to request restriction of your personal data which means that you can, at least for a certain period, stop us from using your personal data. The right to request restriction of your personal data applies if you consider that the personal data about you is incorrect and during the period that we verify this, if the use of your personal data is unlawful and if you wish that we continue to store your personal data instead of deleting the personal data, and if we no longer need your personal data for the purposes for which we collected the personal data, but you need the personal data to manage, defend, or exercise legal claims and rights.
You also have the right to request restriction of your personal data if you have objected to our use of your personal data and during the period we verify whether we have a compelling reason to continue to use your personal data.
If the use of your personal data has been restricted, we are normally only allowed to store your personal data and not use it for any other purpose than to manage, defend or exercise legal claims and rights. We can also use your personal data for other purposes, if you have given your consent to such use.
Right to data portability (Article 20 of the GDPR)
The right to data portability means that you have a right to receive a copy of the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured commonly used format. Moreover, where it is technically feasible, you also have the right to request that the copy of your personal data is transferred directly to an external recipient.
The right to data portability only applies, however, to personal data that we handle based on your consent (Article 6.1 (b) of the GDPR) or for the performance of an agreement with you (Article 6.1 (a) of the GDPR).
Right to lodge a complaint
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority. In Sweden, the supervisory authority is the
Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection
(IMY).

The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.
First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache.
