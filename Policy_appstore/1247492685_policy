2. Information on flight arrivals, departures, timetables and destinations
How is personal data used to ensure that passenger hold baggage is in the correct place?
When you check-in baggage (whether via bag drop or check in desk) Gatwick Airport will allocate an identifier to your bag, and link your bag to your boarding card with that identifier. We do so to (a) ensure that your bag is loaded onto the correct aircraft; and (b) the aircraft does not take off with your bag on-board where you have not boarded the flight.
What personal data is used, and where is it obtained from?
We obtain your name, title and flight details from the barcode included on your boarding card (issued by the airline you are flying with).
We will create a record of your bag(s) and link it/them to you capturing the journey of the bag such as the scanning points, the unique baggage number, the final location it was delivered to. A scan of your baggage is also taken when you journey through security. Whilst no personal is attached to the scan, it can be indirectly identiafiable via the matching barcode attached to your boarding pass when you check your baggage in.

What is Gatwick Airport’s legal basis?
In the unlikely event that Gatwick Airport does collect personal data, it does so on the basis of its legitimate interest in understanding the flow of people around the airport and in detecting potential incidents as soon as possible (which may be indicated by irregularities in the movement of people, for instance congregation or people moving away from an area).

2. Gatwick monitors the flow of passengers through security and shares this information with (a) the police and (b) airlines and their contractors to identify if a passenger has passed through security and is likely to be able board their flight.
What personal data is used, and where is it obtained from?
Every passenger scans their boarding pass when they go through the security gates at Gatwick Airport. Gatwick collects the boarding pass data (flight number, seat number and sequence number) and also the time the passenger went through security and provides it to the airlines and their contractors.
What is Gatwick Airport’s legal basis?
It is in Gatwick’s legitimate interests to provide this information to airlines to maintain operational efficiency. The process allows an airline to assess if their passengers have passed through security in time for them to make their way to the boarding gate.
This processing activity benefits passengers as it facilitates the decision making process behind keeping a boarding gate open to allow a passenger to board (if a passenger does have time to get from security to the boarding gate) or to close the boarding gate and prevent additional delays for the boarded passengers (if the missing passenger is too far away or has not passed through security).
This information may also be shared with the police where it is necessary for them to perform a task that is in the public interest.
Is personal data shared with anyone to achieve this purpose?
Gatwick shares 1) flight number 2) sequence number, 3) seat number and 4) the time the passenger went through security with airlines and their contractors and occasionally the police. The flight number and seat number is data that the airlines and their contractors already hold for flight booking and boarding purposes. They match the data Gatwick has provided with their own data and use this information to identify which passengers have or have not yet boarded the plane.
How long does Gatwick Airport keep personal data for this purpose?
We will retain this personal data for up to one month.
3. Security and CCTV - in and around the terminal building and car parks
How is CCTV used around the airport?
At Gatwick, we have a large number of CCTV cameras operating around the airport campus, covering staff, public and passenger areas. Including our car parks, some of which are operated by our partners Empark (known also as National Car Parks limited).
CCTV footage captures personal data in the form of moving or still images of staff, passengers, members of the public and customers. Gatwick uses CCTV and the personal data captured as part of this processing for the following purposes:
To maintain the safety and security of the airport for our passengers, colleagues and stakeholders, including but not limited to Control Authorities, national security, detection and prevention of crime and aviation security.
To monitor flows and demand throughout the airport to optimise resourcing and passenger experience.
To support the effective management of the airport operation and any incidents for investigative purposes or as evidence to support any formal follow-up to airport incidents.
To provide evidence of regulatory compliance to Department for Transport (DfT) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) or the Airlines Operating Committee.
In response to a data subject access request.
To protect and monitor the Flight Restriction Zone from unmanned aerial systems.
To provide services and meet airport initiatives.
As part of our Passenger Drop of Scheme we use Automatic Number Plate Recognition to identify vehicles that enter the zone. For more information, see the 'Passenger Drop Off Scheme' tab on this page.
What personal data is used, and where is it obtained from?
We may collect CCTV images from all the cameras around the airport. These may include static or moving images of persons as well as vehicle registration plate data (ANPR).
Occasionally these will be linked to specific individuals by name, for instance where CCTV images are downloaded in relation to a security or health and safety incident, or where we need to facilitate a data subject access access request.
Where you make an access request in relation to CCTV either as part of a Data Subject Access Request or as part of a formal request from another organisation, we will record additional information. For example, your name, contact details, address, two forms of identification including one of them photographic to prove you are the person making the request for their personal data or that you have permission to request the data on another’s behalf. If you are requesting CCTV of your vehicle, you will be required to supply proof of ownership for example a registered keeper document (V5). This will be stored on our secure data management system. If you request to view the footage on GAL premises we will also record the CCTV images you viewed and when you viewed them.
We also use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) data from when you enter the Passenger Drop Off Scheme. You can find out more about this in the Passenger Drop Off Tab.
What is Gatwick Airport’s legal basis?
Our legal basis for general CCTV coverage is that we have a legitimate interest in using the system for the above purposes to protect the safety and security of the airport and its staff and passengers and to ensure operational effectiveness.
Our lawful basis for viewing and sharing CCTV for data subject access requests is in line with our legal obligation for individual rights under The Data Protection Act 2018. In the interests of national security, Gatwick will not provide footage from the following areas: any location within the security footprint, anywhere where a security process is taking place as well as the Immigration Halls and the UKBF Customs channels footprints.
In exceptional circumstances, Gatwick Airport reserves the right to deploy covert cameras for the purpose of detecting and preventing crime. This measure is taken to ensure the safety and security of all passengers, staff, and visitors within the airport premises.

This includes Cameras, cabling, storage and network equipment. External access is provided to a third party, TYCO for application support. Tyco then employ the software provider Qognify to do this.
A number of third parties also have access to the CCTV system. These are Law Enforcement Agencies such as Sussex Police, Border Force, National Crime Agency. A number of commercial third parties which have access are also DHL, British Airways, Empark and EasyJet.
How long does Gatwick Airport keep personal data for this purpose?
We retain CCTV images for 30 days however in airport wide central search areas the retention period is 60 days, unless they are downloaded from our CCTV system within that timeframe, for instance in connection with an incident, data subject access request or to share with relevant authorities.
CCTV images downloaded from the system in connection with an incident will be retained until the investigation and any related claims have been closed. Any footage downloaded will be stored in a secure environment and only access by persons who are authorised to do so.
Personal data captured as part of the Data Subject Access Requests will be kept for a period of 2 years.
In limited circumstances it may be necessary for CCTV to be retained for longer than the 60 days.

Staff members who are using the ‘Kiss and Fly’ route as part of their role at Gatwick will also be exempt from paying the fee. Staff will be required to provide their Full Name, Work Email Address, and Work ID number in order for their record to be updated with their fee exemption.
Gatwick will also operate a Local Commuter Scheme. This will allow a maximum of four visits to the airport a day. In order to qualify for this scheme users will have to provide evidence of their address, plus a copy of their vehicle insurance.
