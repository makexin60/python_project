In psychology, the
Stroop effect
is a demonstration of cognitive interference where a delay in the reaction time of a task occurs due to a mismatch in stimuli.
The effect has been used to create a psychological test that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.
A basic task that demonstrates this effect occurs when there is a mismatch between the name of a color
										(e.g., "
green
", or "
red
") and the color it is printed on (i.e., the word "
red
" printed in green ink instead of red ink). When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.

It is also used in conjunction with other neuropsychological assessments to examine a person's executive processing abilities, and can help in the diagnosis and characterization of different psychiatric and neurological disorders.
Researchers also use the Stroop effect during brain imaging studies to investigate regions of the brain that are involved in planning, decision-making, and managing real-world interference (e.g., texting and driving).
