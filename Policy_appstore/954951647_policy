You may refuse to give or withdraw your consent for us to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data by giving us reasonable notice as long as there are no legal or contractual restrictions preventing you from doing so. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to any or all use of your Personal Data, depending on the nature of your request, we may not be in a position to continue to provide our products or services to you or administer any contractual relationship in place, and this may also result in the termination of any agreements with us and you being in breach of your contractual obligations or undertakings, and our legal rights and remedies in such event are expressly reserved. Withdrawing of such consent may also result in the termination of providing other services such as service reminders and keeping of records of our customer-management history.
Please note that if your Personal Data has been provided to us by a third party, you should contact such party directly to make any queries, feedback, and access and correction requests to CDG on your behalf.

Ensuring Personal Data is Up-To-Date
We rely on the Personal Data we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the Personal Data we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You shall ensure that all Personal Data submitted to us is complete, accurate, true and correct. Failure on your part to do so may result in our inability to provide you with products and services you have requested. Please
update us immediately if there is any change to the Personal Data you submitted to us.
Security of Personal Data
Security of Personal Data is very important to us and we take all reasonable precautions and care to protect your Personal Data from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
Some of the ways we protect Personal Data include:

• maintaining physical security over paper records.
Retention
We will retain your Personal Data for a reasonable period for the purposes as cited herein or to the extent as may be required by law.
We will cease to retain your Personal Data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the Personal Data was collected, and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside of Singapore
We generally do not transfer Personal Data to countries outside of Singapore. However, if we do, we will do so according to the requirements under applicable law and we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided under the PDPA.
