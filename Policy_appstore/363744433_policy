Purpose for processing
The lawful basis we rely on
Recruitment and selection

Some of this processing is necessary for the compliance with legal obligations to which BigHand is subject including the requirement to make reasonable adjustments or accommodations where appropriate if you choose to disclose that you have a disability.
Some of this processing is necessary for takings steps at your request to enter into a contract with you.
Additional processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.
BigHand has a legitimate interest in fully assessing applicants to ensure that only suitable and appropriate candidates are selected, to compare candidates and make a fair decision on the most appropriate candidate for the position.
BigHand aims to recruit the best person for each vacancy through fair, systematic, effective recruitment and selection procedures. This will contribute towards BigHand continuing to meet its business objectives, maintain its reputation and attract high calibre employees.
Pre-employment verification and screening
Appropriate pre-employment screening including, where relevant and appropriate, identity check, right to work verification, reference check, credit check, financial sanction check, criminal record checks (if and to the extent permitted by applicable laws), relevant employment history, relevant regulatory status and relevant professional and educational qualifications.
Some of this processing is necessary for the compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject including establishment of the right to work in the country in which you are employed.
Screening which is not legally required is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.

Offers of employment and on-boarding
Making job offers, providing contracts of employment or engagement and preparing to commence your employment or engagement where you accept an offer from us
Some of this processing is necessary for the compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject including the requirement to issue written particulars or terms of employment and the requirement not to unlawfully discriminate in the terms of any offer to you.
Additional processing is necessary to take steps to enter into the contract between you and BigHand and to perform that contract because we will need information to make an appropriate offer to you and administer your employment contract if you join us.
The remainder of the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.
BigHand has a legitimate interest in ensuring the effective engagement of staff on appropriate terms and conditions of employment and that there is a smooth transition into employment for successful candidates and that information supplied in the recruitment process which is relevant to ongoing employment is maintained.

This processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.

It will contribute towards BigHand continuing to meet its business objectives, maintain its reputation and attract high calibre employees.

This processing is necessary for the compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject including ensuring that BigHand can demonstrate its compliance with data protection laws and anti-discrimination laws.
Beyond legal compliance processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued us.

Complaints, claims and litigation
To enforce our legal rights and obligations, and for any purposes in connection with any complaint or legal claim made by, against or otherwise involving you
This processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.
BigHand has a legitimate interest in protecting its organisation from breaches of legal obligations owed to it and defending itself against litigation. This is needed to ensure that our legal rights and interests are protected appropriately, to protect our reputation and to protect us from other damage or loss.

This processing is necessary for the compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject where there is a legal obligation to disclose information or a court or other legal order to provide information is place.
Where not legally required, processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by us.
BigHand has a legitimate interest in co-operating with relevant authorities, government bodies or regulators for the provision of information where appropriate.  We wish to maintain our reputation as a good corporate citizen and to act ethically and appropriately in all the countries in which we do business.
