11. Medallia and CCPA
11.1 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Activities
In this section, “business,” “business purpose,” “consumer,” “commercial purpose,” “personal information,” “sale” or “selling,” and “service provider” refer to the definitions in the CCPA.
Medallia has two areas of activity that are related to the CCPA:
First, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of providing Medallia products and services  to its clients. In this activity, Medallia acts strictly as a “service provider” to our clients under the CCPA, and our clients are “businesses”.
In the Medallia products and services, Medallia collects customer data based on our clients’ instructions. For example, our clients specify what consumers we should contact to provide feedback, when we should contact them (e.g., after completing a purchase at a client’s retail store), how we should contact them (e.g., email or SMS), how often we should send them reminders to provide a response, and what questions are asked. Medallia’s clients also decide how to use or respond to feedback that is collected.
Second, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of its marketing and recruiting efforts. This includes information we collect voluntarily from forms on our website and event registrations, information we collect automatically when you visit our website, apply for a position, and information we obtain from third party sources. In this activity, Medallia acts as a “business” under the CCPA.
11.2 Handling Personal Information Under CCPA
Regardless of which area of activity applies to you,
Medallia
does not sell your personal information
.
To be clear, in the previous 12 months we have not sold, rented, released, disclosed, disseminated, made available, transferred, or otherwise communicated a consumer’s personal information to another business or third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. If that changes, we will update this Privacy Policy.
Further, when we provide the Medallia products and services to our clients, we do not:
process personal information for any commercial purpose other than providing our clients the products and services they have purchased; or
retain, use or disclose personal information outside of the scope of the agreements we have with our clients.
11.3 Personal Information Collected and Disclosures for Business Purposes
The CCPA requires that we disclose the categories of personal information we collect about consumers, and the categories of personal information we disclose for a business purpose.
The chart below details where you find information about the
categories of personal information that Medallia has collected
in the previous 12 months for each activity related to the CCPA.

11.4 Consumer Rights Under the CCPA
Your rights under the CCPA include the right to request a copy of the specific personal information collected about you in the 12 months prior to the request, and a business’s data collection practices (including categories of information collected, how information is used, and who it is disclosed to). We will generally refer to these as “access requests”.
In addition, with some exceptions, you can request deletion of the personal information that is collected about you. We will generally refer to these as “deletion requests”.
You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising their CCPA rights.
With respect to personal data of consumers collected in Medallia products and services, Medallia’s clients are responsible for fulfilling access and deletion requests. Medallia supports these requests by offering our clients product features, processes and assistance in exporting personal information about individuals. These product features and processes complete the data deletion within 30 days of receiving the request from our client.

Data processed
Medallia provides a software-as-a-service platform and related online services to its customers, which are collectively called the Medallia Experience Cloud.
As a data controller, we process personal data of representatives of our clients, potential clients, vendors, service providers, professional advisors, business partners, consultants or other third parties in the EEA and Switzerland (“EEA Business Contacts”) to support our business operations, for example, in the context of sending marketing communications, making sales calls, providing support, invoicing, and collections. From our EEA Business Contacts, we typically collect name, job title, company affiliation and contact information.
As a data processor, we process personal data of EEA and Swiss individuals on behalf of the clients in the Medallia Experience Cloud (“EEA Customer Data”). Our clients use the Medallia Experience Cloud to process personal data at their discretion, including data pertaining to their own customers and employees.
The clients who use the Medallia Experience Cloud provide information on how they process their customers and employees’ data in their own, separate privacy notices. We support the clients who use the Medallia Experience Cloud as a data processor but do not control these customer’s data processing practices.
Purposes of collection and use
We collect and use personal data of EEA Business Contacts for purposes of providing information about our products and services to our clients, registering our clients for events, communicating with business partners, providing support, billing our clients, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes. With respect to marketing, you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Medallia.
We collect and use personal data on behalf of the clients of our the Medallia Experience Cloud for the purposes of providing those platforms and services to our clients. We may access the data to provide the services, to correct and address technical or service problems, to follow instructions of the Medallia customer (and their customers and employees) who submitted the data, or in response to contractual and legal requirements.
Third parties who may process personal data
Medallia uses a limited number of third party service providers and partners to assist us in providing our products and services to our clients. Medallia maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Data Privacy Frameworkobligations.
We may share the personal data of EEA Business Contacts with the providers of our business productivity software (such as email and teleconferencing platforms), consumer relationship management software, marketing and data enhancement software (including marketing communications automation platforms), marketing data analytics software, help desk ticketing software, and billing and collections software in order to enable their respective business functions. If you purchase Medallia products and services through our channel partners, such as distributors and resellers, we may provide the personal data of EEA Business Contacts to such third parties to provide you with information about Medallia’s products and services.
We may share personal data of EEA and Swiss individuals that is collected in the Medallia Experience Cloud (“EEA Customer Data”) with our subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and contractors who provide managed services and support for the platforms and services. We may also share EEA Customer Data with vendors to support our technical operations (including vendors who assist us with visitor analytics, SaaS event logging, and technical support), and provide data storage.
Depending on the technology integrations or features chosen by the clients who purchase the Medallia Experience Cloud, we may also provide EEA Customer Data to partners who provide such integrations or features (including, for example, interactive voice response, SMS, translation integrations, and screen capture features).
Where we have received your personal data under the Frameworks and subsequently transfer it to a third party agent or service provider for processing, then we remain liable if such third party agent or service provider processes your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Framework’s principles.
We may also disclose personal data of EEA Business Contacts and EEA Customer Data where we are legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise), in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or where the disclosure is permitted by law or the Data Privacy Framework principles and we have a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.
Your right to access, limit use, and limit disclosure
EU, UK and Swiss residents have rights to access, correct and delete their personal data, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. Medallia honors these rights by responding to legitimate requests to access, correct, delete, limit use, or disclosure of personal data to privacy@medallia.com. Because Medallia has limited ability to access EEA Customer Data, if you send us a request related to EEA Customer Data please provide the name of the Medallia customer who provided us with or asked us to collect your data. We will refer your request to that customer, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request.
EEA Business Contacts may choose to unsubscribe from marketing communications by following the unsubscribe link contained in each marketing email. For communications from Medallia, Inc., you can also unsubscribe by accessing the preference center by clicking

Personal data privacy

When the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user’s previous activity.
Cookies were designed to be reliable ways for websites to remember the activity that a user had taken in the past such as indicating their preferences.

We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such third-party websites, terms and conditions or policies.
11. Medallia and CCPA
11.1 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Activities
In this section, “business,” “business purpose,” “consumer,” “commercial purpose,” “personal information,” “sale” or “selling,” and “service provider” refer to the definitions in the CCPA.
Medallia has two areas of activity that are related to the CCPA:
First, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of providing Medallia products and services to its clients. In this activity, Medallia acts strictly as a “service provider” to our clients under the CCPA, and our clients are “businesses”. In the Medallia products and services, Medallia collects customer data based on our clients’ instructions. For example, our clients specify what consumers we should contact to provide feedback, when we should contact them (e.g., after completing a purchase at a client’s retail store), how we should contact them (e.g., email or SMS), how often we should send them reminders to provide a response, and what questions are asked. Medallia’s clients also decide how to use or respond to feedback that is collected.
Second, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of its marketing and recruiting efforts. This includes information we collect voluntarily from forms on our website and event registrations, information we collect automatically when you visit our website, apply for a position, and information we obtain from third party sources. In this activity, Medallia acts as a “business” under the CCPA.
11.2 Handling Personal Information Under CCPA
Regardless of which area of activity applies to you,
Medallia does not sell your personal information.
To be clear, in the previous 12 months we have not sold, rented, released, disclosed, disseminated, made available, transferred, or otherwise communicated a consumer’s personal information to another business or third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. If that changes, we will update this Privacy Policy.
Further, when we provide the Medallia products and services to our clients, we do not:
process personal information for any commercial purpose other than providing our clients the products and services they have purchased; or
retain, use or disclose personal information outside of the scope of the agreements we have with our clients.
11.3 Personal Information Collected and Disclosures for Business Purposes
The CCPA requires that we disclose the categories of personal information we collect about consumers, and the categories of personal information we disclose for a business purpose.
The chart below details where you find information about the
categories of personal information that Medallia has collected
in the previous 12 months for each activity related to the CCPA.
Activity
Where you can find information
Providing the Medallia products and services to Medallia clients as a “service provider”
The categories of personal information Medallia collects about consumers vary depending on our clients’ implementation and use of our software. For a generalized description of these categories, please see the Medallia Customer DPA located
here
.

Medallia Experience Cloud Notice
Effective Date: April 6, 2020 – Last Reviewed and Updated April 6, 2020
Introduction
This notice addresses the data Medallia collects to provide our SaaS platform and services to our clients. Clients use this platform to collect customer feedback through different channels, including surveys and integrations with other platforms. Medallia also provides reporting applications that allow our clients to view and analyze the collected feedback.
In our privacy notice, we use the following terms:
“Medallia Experience Cloud” refers to the SaaS platforms and related online services (such as CSM tools), as well as the accompanying professional services we provide to our clients.
“CSM Tools” refers to the customer success analytics platforms, such as Strikedeck, that we offer via a SaaS model.
“client” refers to a business to which Medallia provides the Medallia Experience Cloud, such as those listed at
https://www.medallia.com/customers/;
“customer” refers to an individual who has had an interaction with a Medallia client and whose feedback is collected through the Medallia Experience Cloud. Customer interactions can span a wide variety, and include purchasing goods or services, contacting customer support, checking in to a hotel or property, and visiting a client’s web page or using its mobile app.
“respondent” refers to an individual who is prompted to provide feedback to one of Medallia’s clients through the Medallia Experience Cloud.
What Data We Collect and How We Collect It
Medallia’s and our Clients’ Roles in Data Collection.
In providing the Medallia Experience Cloud to our clients, Medallia collects data only according to our clients’ instructions. Our clients specify what customers we should contact to provide feedback, when we should contact them (for example, after completing a purchase at a client’s retail store), how we should contact them (for example, email or SMS), how often we should send them reminders to provide feedback, and what questions are asked. Medallia’s clients also decide whether to use inbound or outbound data integrations, and how to use or respond to feedback that is collected.
Medallia enters into agreements with our clients that legally obligate Medallia to protect data we receive or are directed to collect, and use it only to provide the products and services specified by the client. Under many data protection laws, including those in Europe, Medallia is considered a “data processor” to our clients, and our clients are considered “data controllers.” As data controllers, Medallia clients are responsible for complying with laws that may require notice, disclosure or consent related to the transfer of data to Medallia or its use in the Medallia Experience Cloud.
For more information on the types of data collected by a particular Medallia client, refer to the privacy notice or communications of the Medallia client. Our clients’ privacy notices are commonly located in the Medallia survey invitation (for web-based surveys) or on the client’s web site or mobile application (for digital surveys).
Legal Basis for Processing.
Medallia clients provide instructions with regard to the upload, collection, transfer, and access of personal data in the Medallia Experience Cloud. As such, Medallia clients determine the legal basis they have for data processing. Medallia clients can use legitimate interest or consent as a legal basis for processing personal data in the Medallia Experience Cloud, although others may apply. For more information, refer to the privacy notice or communications of the Medallia client.
Identity of the Data Controller.
As data controllers, Medallia clients are responsible for identifying themselves, where appropriate, in communications sent by the Medallia Experience Cloud. For example, Medallia survey invitations sent by email or SMS should identify the name of the Medallia client who directs us to conduct the survey. If you are having trouble identifying the data controller associated with a particular Medallia survey, please contact Medallia survey support
here
.
Web-based Surveys and Chat Communications.
In web-based surveys offered by the Medallia Experience Cloud, customers or employees receive a survey invitation and respond to the survey in a web interface. In addition, with the Medallia Experience Cloud’s chat communication products, clients can communicate with their customers through SMS or popular messaging applications. To send survey invitations or chat communications Medallia clients can, for example, provide the Medallia Experience Cloud with customer names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, social messaging handle, and information about the customers’ interactions with their business (e.g., the name of the client’s store where the customer shopped or the hotel at which they are staying). In addition, Medallia clients can provide the Medallia Experience Cloud with information that segments customers into groups, such as the type of account the customer holds, the type of product or service purchased, or whether the customer is enrolled in a loyalty program.
When a respondent navigates to a Medallia web-based survey or a chat communication, Medallia collects the respondent’s IP address, the date and time the respondent accessed the survey, survey or chat responses (typically numerical scores and narrative text responses), how far the user has navigated in the survey, and the type of device and web browser the customer used to access the survey. In some surveys, clients also direct Medallia to collect the geographical location of the customer’s device that is used to access the survey.
Digital Surveys.
Clients can use the Medallia Experience Cloud’s digital feedback capture tools to prompt their customers to respond to a survey within the client’s digital channels, such as a web page or mobile application. Clients can configure these surveys to:
prompt customers for information such as name, email, a survey score, and a narrative text response to a prompt;
collect analytics information (such as the customer’s IP address and type of web browser or mobile device);
collect customer ID (such as the login name or email the customer uses to access the client’s web site or mobile application); and
allow customers to take a screenshot that captures portions of the client’s web page or mobile application.
Integrations.
Clients can integrate other tools, processes or platforms as inbound sources of data for the Medallia Experience Cloud, such as CRM platforms or marketing tools. For CSM Tools, Clients can integrate other tools, processes, or platforms via pre-built or custom-built data connectors. For example, data may be pulled into CSM Tools from analytics platforms, app monitoring platforms, client databases, or data warehouses. Medallia clients control what data is stored in the Medallia Experience Cloud from these integrations. For more information, refer to the privacy notice or the communications of the Medallia client.
Clients can also configure the Medallia Experience Cloud as an outbound source of data for other tools, processes, or platforms, such as collaboration tools. Clients and any third parties associated with those tools, processes, or platforms are responsible for managing personal data outside the Medallia Experience Cloud. For example, clients can configure surveys to prompt customers to write reviews on third-party websites. If a customer chooses to submit a review for publication on that third-party site, any information the customer provides on that site is governed by the privacy notice or communications of that site.
Medallia Reporting Applications.
Medallia provides clients web-based and mobile applications that are used by employees of Medallia clients to review and analyze customer feedback and other data collected in the Medallia Experience Cloud (referred to as “reporting applications” in this notice). To provide their employees access to these applications, clients may send Medallia employee names, identifiers (e.g., an employee ID), job title or function, and the store or business location they are associated with.
When an employee accesses a Medallia reporting application, Medallia collects the employee’s user name, IP address of the device used to access the reporting application, geographic area associated with the IP address, type of web browser and mobile device, time and date that the reporting application was accessed, and areas of the reporting application that were visited.
Social Media Features and Widgets.
Clients can configure surveys to include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “share this” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy notice or privacy-specific communications of the company providing them.
CSM Tools.
Our CSM Tools, such as the Strikedeck platform, can be used by employees of Medallia clients to review and analyze customer feedback data as well as customer success data to track customer interactions, satisfaction levels, and product usage. Clients may also send surveys, alerts or other email communications directly from the CSM Tools. Medallia clients may also use data connectors to directly pull in information about their customers’ interactions with their business. In addition, clients can provide the CSM Tools with information that segments customers into groups, such as the type of account the customer holds or usage behavior, or on an individual level, such as by contact type.
Information Medallia Does Not Collect.
Unless configured by a client to do so, the Medallia Experience Cloud does not collect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or government identification numbers, nor does it collect information defined as “sensitive personal data” under EU law, such as race, sexual orientation, or union membership.
How Personal Data is Used
By Medallia and Partners.
Medallia uses personal data gathered in the Medallia Experience Cloud to provide the SaaS platform and services for which the client has engaged Medallia.
These uses can include contacting a client’s customers to provide feedback for web-based and digital surveys, providing gathered feedback and assisting the customer in managing data in the Medallia Experience Cloud, and analyzing the data gathered to improve the client’s business.
Medallia Clients.
Medallia clients can use personal data collected in the Medallia Experience Cloud to improve their customers’ experiences with their business. Clients can use Medallia’s reporting applications to provide customer feedback to their front line employees, as well as managers and executives. Clients can also perform analysis in customer feedback to prioritize and make operational changes to their business, and use personal data gathered in the Medallia Experience Cloud to send follow-up communications to customers.
Who Accesses Personal Data
Medallia Professional Services and Support.
When a Medallia client engages Medallia’s professional services teams, Medallia professional services employees in Medallia’s Group Companies can access personal data of that client to perform work associated with tasks described above. If there is a support request, troubleshooting issue, or technical error (e.g., bug or product malfunction) that requires access to personal data, Medallia support and engineering staff in the Group Companies who are needed to address the issue will access that data.
Access to personal data stored in the Medallia Experience Cloud is provided using systems, procedures and controls approved by Medallia’s security team. Access is provided only as long as needed to perform the necessary work.
Third Party Professional Services, Servicing and Support.

California Consumer Privacy Act Notice
Effective Date January 1, 2020 – Last Reviewed and Updated December 9, 2019
Introduction
This notice addresses Medallia’s responsibilities to our clients and required disclosures to California consumers under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA. This notice supplements our Medallia Experience Cloud Notice and our Website Notice.
In this notice, we use the following terms:
“client” refers to a business to which Medallia provides its services and SaaS platform, such as those listed at
https://www.medallia.com/customers
;
“business,” “business purpose,” “consumer,” “commercial purpose,” “personal information,” “sale” or “selling,” and “service provider” refer to the definitions in the CCPA;
“Marketing Data” is defined in the Website Notice, which can be accessed from the navigation pane of www.medallia.com/privacy-policy;
“Medallia Experience Cloud” refers to the SaaS platform and provision of professional services we provide to our clients; and
“respondent” refers to an individual who is prompted to provide a response to one of Medallia’s clients through the Medallia Experience Cloud.
Medallia’s activity related to the CCPA
For the purposes of this notice, Medallia has two areas of activity that are related to the CCPA.
First, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of providing a software platform called the Medallia Experience Cloud to its clients. In this activity, Medallia acts strictly as a “service provider” to our clients under the CCPA, and our clients are “businesses”.
In the Medallia Experience Cloud, Medallia collects customer data based on our clients’ instructions. For example, our clients specify what consumers we should contact to provide feedback, when we should contact them (e.g., after completing a purchase at a client’s retail store), how we should contact them (e.g., email or SMS), how often we should send them reminders to provide a response, and what questions are asked. Medallia’s clients also decide how to use or respond to feedback that is collected.
Second, Medallia collects data from consumers in the course of its marketing efforts. This includes information we collect voluntarily from forms on our website and event registrations, information we collect automatically when you visit our website, and information we obtain from third party sources. In this activity, Medallia acts as a “business” under the CCPA.
Medallia’s handling of personal information under the CCPA
Regardless of which area of activity applies to you, Medallia
does not sell your personal information
.
To be clear, in the previous 12 months we have not sold, rented, released, disclosed, disseminated, made available, transferred, or otherwise communicated a consumer’s personal information to another business or third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. If that changes, we will update this notice.
Further, when we provide the Medallia Experience Cloud to our clients, we do not:
process personal information for any commercial purpose other than providing our clients the products and services they have purchased; or
retain, use or disclose personal information outside of the scope of the agreements we have with our clients.
Personal information collected and disclosures for business purposes
The CCPA requires that we disclose the categories of personal information we collect about consumers, and the categories of personal information we disclose for a business purpose.
