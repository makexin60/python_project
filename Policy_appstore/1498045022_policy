Data Controller and Data Processor
A Data Controller makes decisions about how and why your personal data is processed. The Data Controller should always explain the purposes of processing personal data in a Privacy Notice - like this one!
A Data Processor processes personal data
on the behalf of
a Data Controller, which means that it must follow the instructions given to it by the Controller. These instructions a part of the contract between the Controller and the Processor, and are usually set out in a specific Data Sharing Agreement.
‚úÖGlean has a Data Sharing Agreement in place with every Data Processor that we work with. You can learn more about Data Sharing Agreements on the ICO's website
here

We might also include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our emails, to help us understand if our messages were opened and if any links were clicked. In some cases, as we mention below, third parties may also get the opportunity to set cookies and similar technologies.

Third parties and Targeted Advertising
We allow trusted third parties to use cookies on or outside our website for the same purposes described in this section. We may also use service providers acting on our behalf to use cookies for the purposes described in this section, and to provide targeted advertising. This means cookies and related technologies are used to serve you targeted ads after you've visited or interacted with our website (for example, you might see an advert for Glean's software when you're using Facebook because you agreed to our use of marketing cookies).
We don't serve targeted social adverts to people under the age of 18. This means that when we set up a retargeting advertising campaign on the Facebook platform for example, we only send the advert to people over the age of 18. We use the age settings that Facebook (Meta) provides to achieve this.

üîíSensitive personal data collection (Special Category Data)
Depending on how you interact with us, there may be times where you provide us with more sensitive personal data (also called special category data). You can learn more about special category data on the ICO's website
here
. Examples of situations where we may collect this kind of data include; when you provide us with feedback or complete one of our surveys.
The UK GDPR requires us to have an article 6 lawful basis for processing your special category data (these are described in the tables above)
and
one of the conditions set out in article 9. Where Glean knows that an interaction between us will result in the sharing of special category data, the article 9 condition that we rely on is:
explicit consent
. This means that we'll always ask for your¬†consent to process your special category personal data when we make a survey or feedback form available to you.
You can withdraw your consent at any time, by contacting
legal@glean.co
.
üö™Opting out of marketing communications
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing emails at any time by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our email or by contacting us. This means that we'll stop using your personal data for marketing purposes.
However, we may still need to process your personal data for other purposes, for example, to provide you with our software, or to send you emails about important updates to our terms and conditions.
üîÑChange of purpose
We'll only use your personal data for the purposes we collected it for in the first place. In rare cases, we might use it for another reason that's consistent
with
the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we'll contact you first and explain the reason why and the legal basis which allows us to do this. There are specific circumstances where we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where we have to, or, where it's allowed by law. For example, in a situation where we'd need to cooperate with law enforcement.
üìñDoes Glean share personal data?
We'll start by saying that at Glean, we truly respect your privacy and would never sell or rent your personal data. There are instances when we'll need to share your personal data with other parties (and then only the minimum amount necessary to do what we need to do). We'll describe these here:
Sharing within our own business, which means our UK parent company and US subsidiary company. This sharing will be for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice relating to our role as Data Controller, or, to provide a service as a Data Processor (for example, our US company may handle the payment procedure for a US-based individual).
Sharing with third-party service providers that process personal data on our behalf (our Data Processors). We use carefully-chosen third party providers for their expertise in particular areas, such as: processing payments, hosting services (cloud storage), customer relationship management, assisting with user feedback, product transcription services, and others. You can request an up-to-date list of all our
Third Party Data Processors at this web page:
https://glean.co/third-party-data-processors

This data sharing forms part of our agreement with your organisation.
Where your access to the software is provided by your organisation, and your organisation is participating in a whole organisation trial (also called a sitewide pilot), we'll share the following individual
usage data

Sharing in the event of a merger, sale, acquisition, or reorganisation of all or parts of our business, data covered by this Privacy Notice may be transferred in connection with that business event.
Sharing in the event we need to respond to a legal request for your information. We'll only ever share your data with law enforcement or other government bodies where it's required to comply with a warrant, court order, subpoena, or other lawful government requests. We'll contact if this¬†has taken place.
In rare cases, sharing data is necessary to investigate or take action relating to illegal activities, or, where people, our property, or the systems we use to provide our software and services to you have been harmed.
üåçInternational data transfers
As a software company¬†that provides services globally, we may transfer, store and process your personal data with third-party service providers based outside of the country in which you're based. Laws in those countries might be different from the laws of the country where you live. Where we transfer, store and process your personal data outside of the UK or EEA, we'll make sure that the appropriate safeguard is in place to protect your personal data. These safeguards include:
Where appropriate, we'll work with third party providers that are UK or EEA based, or, which are deemed to provide an
adequate level of protection
for personal data by the European Commission
and UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
Where we need to work with providers based outside of the UK, EEA or other approved adequacy country, we'll make sure that we have a Data Processing Agreement in place with the third party provider. The Data Processing Agreement will also need to include the appropriate data transfer mechanism, like the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
Please reach out to us if you'd like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside of the UK or EEA.
üîíData security
Glean is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data. This is why we have put in place physical, administrative, contractual, and technical measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed when it shouldn't be. We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other approved third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We've also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach or security incident that may compromise the safety of your personal data, and we'll notify you and any applicable regulatory body of a breach where we're legally required to do so.
We do need to let you know that unfortunately, the transfer of personal data through the internet carries its own risks and we can't guarantee the security of your data transmitted through the internet - if you do this, it's at your own risk.
Our website, software and services may provide links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on apps, third-party websites or services is provided directly to the operators of those websites or services, and is subject to their policies governing privacy and security, even if accessed via our website or in connection with our services.

To help us to decide the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider:
