End your reliance on user-level data
Ecosystem collaboration is key to grow your business. But in the privacy era, relying on sharing user-level data isn’t just risky, it’s a bad choice for your business and customers.
Take the next step in data collaboration
Now you can bring your data together with your partners for joint analysis in a privacy-preserving way
Our Privacy-Preserving Technologies
The AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud is powered by an ever-evolving range of innovative privacy-preserving technologies.
Add calculated “noise” to your data so that it can never be reverse-engineered by others.
Create a safe zone between you and your partners for zero-trust data collaboration.
Measure the aggregated impact of marketing campaigns when a subset of conversions can’t be attributed on a user level.
Tailor every collaboration to fit your business needs
Every collaboration is unique, with different levels of trust and distinct business objectives. That’s why we developed fully configurable Privacy Cloud Applications that enable precise data controls, flexibility, and innovation.
Connect
Data input: Define what data flows into your Privacy Cloud Application
First-party data: CRM, SDK data
Second-party data: Data from collaborating partners and platforms (e.g Facebook, Apple etc)
Comply
Data governance: Define privacy thresholds and aggregation levels
Privacy regulations: Select the privacy laws and guidelines that apply to your business (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA and more)
Enrich
Data intersection: Dynamically compute the overlap/intersection of various datasets
Enrichment: Configure how different datasets complement one another and how they are enriched with third-party data
Analyze & query
Measurement: Determine which types of analytics each party can perform
Business logic: Query data based on your business requirements
Data output: Decide what data leaves the Privacy Cloud Application, in what form, and where you send it
We believe that privacy and customer experience don’t need to be an either or choice. Our mission at AppsFlyer is to introduce a new level of collaboration and interoperability that wasn’t previously possible, allowing you to create exceptional customer experiences without compromising privacy.
Maximize customer experience based on comprehensive insights
AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud adds insights that would otherwise be unavailable. More data sources, enhanced modeling, and advanced analytics, ensure that you always make the best marketing choices for your business.
Gain visibility into your conversions and analyze every campaign
Run predictive models to measure bottom line events with early insights
Analyze the incremental lift between campaigns run on control and test groups
Use deep insights to distinguish between real conversions and bots
Get visibility into SKAN performance KPIs, including CVR, ROI, CPI, ARPU, ROAS, eCPA
Segment, manage, and amplify audiences while preserving user privacy
AppsFlyer has teamed up with Intel to deliver end-to-end encryption that will power the Privacy Cloud
We are working with Intel to leverage their hardware-enhanced crypto acceleration 3rd Generation Xeon platform
This partnership will significantly speed up computation and time to market of the Privacy Cloud Privacy-Preserving cryptographic technologies such as Homomorphic encryption (HE) and Private Set Intersection (PSI)

Don’t just take our word for it
“As part of our long partnership, we’re happy to be design partners in this exciting next step for AppsFlyer and our ecosystem. AppsFlyer’s dedication to the highest standard of end user experience and privacy is evident in their work and value proposition. Their data insights and easily configurable data collaboration make it the obvious choice for building this advanced data clean room implementation.”
“AppsFlyer’s Privacy Cloud is perfectly integrated with FunPlus’ BI system and runs smoothly every day. With AppsFlyer’s Privacy Cloud, we’re able to get more insights into our campaign’s performance and conduct more precise campaign optimization. We look forward to collaborating further with AppsFlyer on privacy preserving technologies.”
“Our collaboration with AppsFlyer is a step toward the future of privacy preserving computing. It will enable AppsFlyer’s partners and customers to gain valuable insights while maintaining a very high standard of user privacy.“
“Using AppsFlyer’s Privacy Cloud, we were able to continue analyzing campaign efficiency on Facebook Ads following the deprecation of their Advanced Mobile Measurement (AMM) program“

/ 4
The Privacy Cloud is a safe, controlled environment for brands, partners, and platforms to securely bring their data together for joint analysis based on defined guidelines and configurations. It provides the ability to compute and analyze joint datasets, and derive business insights, without exposing individual user-level data.
Collaborate with your partners in safe Data Clean Room environments
Avoid attribution data blind spots with conversion data and insights that aren’t available from other attribution solutions
Enrich your 1st party data with attribution data and complement it with data in the Data Clean Room
Gain full control of your data by configuring exactly what is shared within the Privacy Cloud, and defining data aggregation levels, granularity and more
Bring your own business logic, or leverage AppsFlyer’s business logic such as Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP), lift measurement (incrementality), audience segmentation, mobile fraud, SKAN measurement, predictive analytics and more.
Comply with all privacy regulations, policies, and guidelines
Having campaign optimization and retargeting efforts rely on user-level data is no longer a viable solution. It compromises users’ privacy and creates significant data blind spots. Recent privacy changes in the industry have made it very clear: it’s time for a new way forward. Deep campaign insights and great marketing decisions can be made based on aggregated data, as long as the data is:
Accurate
Complete
Generated from user-level data (that remains within the Data Clean Room)
The Privacy Cloud can help you achieve exactly that. It ingests user-level data, compliments it with other data, and provides you with the comprehensive insights you need, based on your business logic, to grow your business in a privacy-centric way.
Yes. The Privacy Cloud is preconfigured based on the privacy guidelines set by the various platforms. These preconfigured settings are constantly being updated as new privacy guidelines are being rolled out by Apple, Google (and/or any other platforms and partners) to make sure you are always aligned with their latest requirements.
If user-level data sharing is allowed (based on the specific partner and platform privacy guidelines, privacy laws applicable to you and user consent) and that’s what you require, then yes, user-level data can still be shared.
We are 100% unbiased and independent. The trust we’ve gained as a company over the last decade, and our unbiased, neutral positioning is what helped us build an amazing ecosystem of 90K+ apps and 9,000+ partners.
We have developed the Industry’s most advanced and disruptive privacy solutions. We’re defining new ecosystem privacy standards through groundbreaking machine learning technology, scale, and expert execution.
Attributing data, analyzing it, enriching it, and generating insights out of it are our expertise. We know how to handle every type of data set, and any use case and edge case, across every channel, platform and campaign.
We deliver an extensive stack of Privacy-Preserving Technologies that can be used on top of the Privacy Cloud: Predictive analytics, SKAN measurement, audience segmentation, lift measurement (incrementality), fraud insights, Aggregated Advanced Privacy, and more.
We offer flexible and configurable data collaboration that gives you full and continuous control of your data and the business logic running on it.

What's inside?
Closing the feedback loop
The IDFA/ATT change
Both user privacy and user experience
And why closing the feedback loop is crucial to enabling both
Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in
a recent statement
that
:
“The App Store is a place where innovators and dreamers can bring their ideas to life, and users can find safe and trusted tools to make their lives better.”
In order to deliver better user privacy, do users necessarily need to compromise on their experience, and the value they’re getting from their favorite apps? Must there really be a trade-off, or can the two coexist?
Privacy is a fundamental human right, and a core value that both Apple and AppsFlyer share. Over the years, and most recently in its latest worldwide developer conference, Apple proved that there is a way to maintain both user privacy, and a superior user experience.
Let’s review some of Apple’s recent privacy enhancements:
Photos
– When allowing an app to access your photos, you can now give permission to share only specific photos, instead of the entire photo library.
Contacts
– With iOS 14, you won’t have to share your entire contact list with apps, just the ones your app really
needs
access to in order to provide its promise.
WiFi
– Devices will not broadcast your MAC address (a non-resettable, persistent ID) to every WiFi hotspot around you.
Camera & microphone
– You will now have a clear indication when an app is using your camera and microphone.
None of these privacy enhancements compromise the user’s experience, or the value they receive from their device or a given app. On the contrary, these measures increase users’
trust
in the app store economy. Eventually, these actions are win-win-win for everyone – consumers, app developers, and the app store economy at-large.
Apple’s privacy decisions – enhanced privacy AND better user experience
ATT Framework – Apple
The IDFA/ATT change
Following these important improvements, Apple introduced the App TrackingTransparency (ATT) framework, which will ultimately eliminate the
IDFA
.
The IDFA is a great tool that enables the app store economy to flourish. On the other hand, it introduces privacy concerns, as it can be used in various ways, some of which could potentially harm user privacy. The IDFA is not inherently “
bad
” or “
good
” for users, and depends entirely on how it’s used.
IDFA risks (the “bad”)
IDFAs can be used to measure users across apps, build user profiles without proper consent or worse, attach GPS data to users across apps. In addition, they can be used for questionable practices like selling customer data and trading it for targeting or other uses. Apple is trying to get rid of these practices on their platform, which is without doubt a great move.
IDFA benefits (the “good”)
User experience
In many cases, the IDFA is used to provide a stellar user experience and increased value to consumers.
If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.
There is no doubt that measurement, or closing the feedback loop with attribution, is the key to improving user experience. Did the user find value in what was offered to them? Was the user experience good?
To properly understand and measure the user’s journey, there is no need for any measuring across apps, no profiling, and surely no selling of user data. Developers measure users’ activity within the scope of their apps, and connect that to their owned media such as websites, social media platforms, emails, user referrals, and their own ads which users interacted with to install their app.
Monetization and the app store economy
Measurement allows app developers to
monetize their work
, so they can continue to innovate and create better products for their users. On the other hand, measurement makes sure that these developers present current and future users with relevant and appealing content, rather than spraying and praying.
Moreover, IDFA introduced a major privacy improvement over its predecessor – the UDID, with the ability to reset and opt-out. Without the IDFA or an appropriate replacement, some in the ecosystem might be pushed to find loopholes, or use far more intrusive techniques.
Great user privacy and great user experience can coexist
Think about cars, for example; no one would think to suggest eliminating the use of cars altogether, even though they can be very dangerous. We believe that there are ways to increase users’ privacy
and
to improve their experience, creating a win-win-win for everyone.
Eliminating IDFA without allowing proper attribution: Great privacy. Negative user experience
In the last two years, we’ve been preparing for
an IDFA-less ecosystem
. We’ve been investing in multiple products and solutions, which along with our lifelong investment in privacy and security, make us very well prepared for the upcoming iOS14 updates.
We are excited to share our immediate solutions with our customers and partners in the coming days and weeks, as well as to continue our discussions with Apple on long term ideas to maintain the highest levels of both user privacy and user experience.
“In a challenging and unsettled time, the App Store provides enduring opportunities for entrepreneurship, health and well-being, education, and job creation, helping people adapt quickly to a changing world. We’re committed to doing even more to support and nurture the global App Store community – from one-developer shops in nearly every country to businesses that employ thousands of workers – as it continues to foster innovation, create jobs, and propel economic growth for the future.” – Tim Cook

What's inside?
Great power, great responsibility
Expectation
Since the very beginning, privacy and security have been one of AppsFlyer’s core pillars, and our long-term commitment and investment in these areas pushed us to become experts on both. It helped us gain the trust of the biggest brands in the world by continuously prioritizing end-users’ privacy and experience.
As a first-party, cloud-based software, used as a CRM, AppsFlyer enables brands to delight their end-users while preserving their privacy, and helps them comply with regulations and platform policies such as the updated iOS 14 guidelines.
We’ve spent the last few years working on several innovative privacy-preserving solutions. Recently, we introduced a few of these groundbreaking technologies that are changing the industry’s measurement paradigm: From
Incrementality measurement
, to our
SK360 suite of products
, predictive analytics in SKAdNetwork (PredictSK),
web to app campaigns
, and
Aggregated Advanced Privacy
(AAP) framework.
These solutions enable our customers to maintain exceptional user experience while also preserving the highest standards of privacy protection.
In the last couple of months, we’ve been collaborating with the entire market to adapt to
SKAdNetwork
and introduced SK360, helping brands to maximize SKAdNetwork’s value and insights. However, the ecosystem adoption rates of Apple’s SKAdNetwork are still low, given its complexities,
misconceptions
,
potential fraud risks
, and the lack of clarity regarding the enforcement date.
These risks and unknowns introduce significant challenges for all players in the ecosystem, but mostly for app developers. We are fully committed to resolving these challenges through our continued efforts to educate all affected parties, and by democratizing SKAdNetwork through collaboration across advertisers, ad-networks, and the entire ecosystem.
With great power, comes great responsibility
As a trusted market leader, we are aware of our immense responsibility. Both to our customers, by enabling them to comply with Apple’s policies and guidelines, and to the end-users, by making sure their privacy is preserved without impacting their experience.
Privacy and security experts widely agree that aggregated data is preferable to user-level data when it comes to privacy and security risks. We have also previously discussed how aggregated measurement can
improve both users’ experience and privacy
, without building extensive user-level profiles, by simply closing the user feedback loop on an aggregated level as opposed to user-level.
To that end, Aggregated Advanced Privacy will become the default operational mode, and
user-level attribution data will not be available by default for Apple devices operating on iOS 14.5 or above
, except in cases that are explicitly permitted by Apple, such as:
owned media
,
ATT
consented users, or users who have not yet updated to iOS 14.5.
Similar to SKAdnetwork, AppsFlyer’s Aggregated Advanced Privacy aims to prevent cross-site measurement and the ability to uniquely identify a user or device. In fact, AppsFlyer’s Aggregated Advanced Privacy takes SKAdNetwork privacy levels as a minimum
benchmark
for its privacy-preserving thresholds.
What to expect down the road in 2021
While deterministic user-level attribution is an accurate proxy to aggregated campaign performance, we have found that aggregated data provides more accurate measurement in a non-deterministic world. This is simply because the machine learning goal is to maximize the accuracy of the campaign’s aggregated performance, not the end-user attribution accuracy.
In other words, while the goal of user-level attribution is to try and minimize false-positives and negatives, aggregated methods are not bound to user-level constraints, and therefore can provide better accuracy and much better user privacy.
Our goal is to maximize campaign performance accuracy and granularity while providing a level of privacy that is equivalent or better to that defined by Apple and its SKAdnetwork framework.
This is why we will continue to enhance and develop our Aggregated Advanced Privacy measurement technologies to improve privacy by making cross-site measurement technically impossible and improving on the SKAdNetwork privacy benchmark.
As a trusted, unbiased and independent market leader, it is our responsibility to ensure we’re constantly doing the right thing for our customers, app developers, ecosystem and most importantly the end users.

Introduction
AppsFlyer provides attribution and marketing analytics services (“
Services
“) that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, “
Customer(s)
“) to: (i) measure and analyze the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (“
Applications
“) or such other conversion metric (e.g. relaunch of Application); and (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below). The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.
This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer’s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer’s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Privacy Policy. To view the Privacy Policy, please
click here
. Furthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (“
Agreement(s)
“). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to “
End User(s)
” means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer’s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer’s Applications, websites, products and services; and (ii) any reference to “
AppsFlyer
” “
we
” “
us
” or “
our
” shall mean AppsFlyer Ltd. and its affiliates.
End User Data Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, “
End User Data
”).
“
Technical Information
”: this refers to technical information related to an End User’s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
“
Technical Identifiers
”: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
“
Engagement Information
”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“
Registration Information
” and together with the End User Data, “
Customer Data
”), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer (“
Log Data
”).
How Data is Collected
Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:
When provided voluntarily (e.g. Customer’s Registration Information).
When the Customer integrates AppsFlyer’s SDK’s, API’s, pixels, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads (“
Collection Technologies
”). For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Customer in connection with the measurement and analysis of Customer’s marketing campaigns and that have partnered with AppsFlyer (“
Partners
”).
How Data is Used by AppsFlyer
When AppsFlyer receives End User Data from a Customer, it uses such End User Data as follows:
to provide such Customer with the Services they have subscribed for. Such services may include, without limitation, attribution, analytics and ad fraud protection services. Please visit
https://www.appsflyer.com
for more information regarding the Services.
to establish: (i) matches between devices used by an End User; and (ii) to detect fraud (such matched data and fraud data, collectively, the, “
Platform Data
”) in order to ensure more accurate attribution measurement and ad fraud protection for Customers using the Services. Platform Data does not contain PII such as End User names, physical addresses, phone numbers or other similar personal data that can directly identify an individual.
With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with the Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services. Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customers of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities; and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.
AppsFlyer may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services (“
Aggregated Data
”). Aggregated Data shall be anonymous and in no way reveal the identity of the Customer or any End User.

Upon our Customer’s request– (e.g. to Partners);
To our subsidiaries and global branches as necessary to help us support and maintain the Services provided to Customers;
To our service providers who help to support our Services – such as data hosting providers and payment processors; Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
When legally required (e.g. court orders or other lawful requests by public authorities), including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
To respond to, or prevent, fraud or to protect the safety of AppsFlyer, its Customers, End Users or the public;
As part of any merger or acquisition of AppsFlyer, in which case End User Data may be transferred to the surviving or acquiring entity.
Cross Border Data Transfers
AppsFlyer may need to transfer Customer Data to countries other than the country from which the Data originated. Any such transfer shall be done in compliance with all applicable laws. With regards to the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States, please be assured that AppsFlyer continues to comply with all applicable laws in respect of such transfers and any data transfers to the United States will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth in our DPA with the relevant service provider.
Protecting Data and Retention
AppsFlyer implements appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction or damage of Customer Data. For more information on our security controls, please see

AppsFlyer will not retain: (i) End User Data for more than twenty-four months except where otherwise directed by Customers or required or allowed by law; and (ii) Registration Information, Log Data or Platform Data for more time than is needed to serve the legitimate business need for which it was collected.
Relationship, Lawful Basis and End User Choices
Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, when processing End User Data in connection with the provision of Services to a Customer, AppsFlyer is deemed a ‘data processor’ while its Customers are deemed ‘data controllers’.
Therefore, End Users should closely review the Privacy Policies of the Applications and websites they use in order to learn about the privacy practices of our Customers.
Where AppsFlyer may be deemed a data controller under the laws of certain jurisdictions (e.g. in connection with its processing of Log Data or Registration Information), AppsFlyer shall comply with all applicable laws related to its status as a data controller and shall only use the data as described in this Services Privacy Policy. With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis AppsFlyer relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between AppsFlyer and Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyze and improve the Services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may provide End Users with various rights in connection with the processing of End User Data, including:
The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;
The right to access certain information about you that we process;
The right to have us correct or update any Personal Information;
The right to have certain Information erased;
The right to have us temporarily block our processing of certain Information;
The right to have Information exported into common machine-readable format;
The right to object to our processing of Information in cases of direct marketing, or when we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis to process your information; and
The right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data processor, End Users should contact our Customers to pursue any such legal data subject rights. AppsFlyer will cooperate with its Customers to support and comply with any such data subject rights requests.
Where AppsFlyer is deemed a data controller, End Users may exercise their rights by contacting AppsFlyer at:
privacy@appsflyer.com
. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note these rights may be limited in certain circumstances as provided by applicable law. In any event, AppsFlyer provides End Users with the ability to opt-out of being measured by the Services by emailing a request to
privacy@appsflyer.com
