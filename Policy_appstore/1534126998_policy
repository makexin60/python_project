We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials. The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of your subscription. If you do not pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Service (and may do so without notice).

Copyright Notice Policy A. Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any materials accessible on or from the App infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from the App by submitting written notification to our Copyright Agent at the address or email listed in Part C below. Please note that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that certain material or activity on the App is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA. In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (17 U.S.C. § 512) ("DMCA"), the written notice (the "DMCA Notice") must include substantially the following: A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.
B. Counter-Notice by Accused Member If you are a User and we have taken down your User Content due to suspicion of copyright infringement, you may dispute the alleged infringement by sending a written communication (a "Counter-Notice") to our Copyright Agent, at the email listed in Part C below. The Counter-Notice must include the following information: A physical or electronic signature of the accused party. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the User has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. The User's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the User consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which such address is located, or if the User's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the User will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of copyright infringement or an agent of such person. Remember that even though we process DMCA Notice and the Counter-Notice, we do not adjudicate these disputes. The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your Counter-Notice. Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

E. Termination of Repeat Infringers In appropriate circumstances, we will terminate the accounts of Users who are repeat copyright infringers.
F. Revision of Policy We may revise this policy at any time, including by posting a new version on our website.
No Legal Advice Nothing contained in these Terms or the Service constitutes legal advice. If you have any questions regarding your legal rights and legal obligations, you should consult with your attorney.

BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS WAIVER DISCLOSURE Agreement to Arbitration; Class Waiver: You and we agree, except as provided below regarding small claims court proceedings, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the App, the Service, and the Content, including, but not limited to, our Privacy Policy and/or our privacy practices generally, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. YOU AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, THE U.S. FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE TERMS, AND THAT YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. Pre-Filing Mediation. In the event of a dispute, prior to initiating an arbitration, the party asserting the claim must first send to the other, by overnight courier, a written Notice of Claim ("Notice"). If you are the claimant, the Notice to Us must be addressed by emailing the Email. If we are the claimant, the Notice must be sent to the address we have on file for you in your Account. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. Following receipt of the Notice, each party agrees to negotiate with the other in good faith about the claim. If the claim is not resolved to the satisfaction of the claimant within sixty (60) days after Notice is provided, the claimant may pursue the claim in arbitration or file a claim in small claims court, as appropriate. Additional Arbitration Provisions: (a) Settlement Offers: During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. (b) Initiating A Claim: The form required to initiate an arbitration can be printed or downloaded from
www.adr.org
(
http://www.adr.org/
). Alternatively, you may contact the arbitration administrator by calling 1-800-778-7879 or writing to the American Arbitration Association, 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271. (c) Fees for Initiating Arbitration: If you are required to pay a filing fee to initiate arbitration after We receive notice of the initiation of arbitration, We will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee at the address provided in the Notice, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000. (d) Applicable Rules; Administrator: The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at
www.adr.org
(
http://www.adr.org/
), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or writing to the American Arbitration Association, 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement. (e) Location of Hearing: Unless you and We agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in New York, New York. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. (f) Class Waiver: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and We agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one party, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable as applied to any claim asserted by any individual, then the entirety of the arbitration provision set forth herein shall be null and void. (g) Injunctive Relief Limitation: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by that party's individual claim. (h) Small Claims Procedure Alternative: Notwithstanding the foregoing binding arbitration procedure, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court (provided the claim otherwise qualifies for such a program) as an alternative to proceeding with arbitration. Opt-Out Provision. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE, THE SERVICE BY WRITING TO THE EMAIL OR TO THE ARBITRATION NOTICE ADDRESS. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE OPTING OUT AND CONTAINING ENOUGH DETAILS ABOUT YOU FOR US TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS. IF MORE THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS HAVE PASSED, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT-OUT OF THIS PROVISION AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.
