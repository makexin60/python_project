Links to Third Party Websites
Our Site may offer links to other websites, including links embedded in advertisements and links to various news sources that are not under the control of Breitbart.

We do not own or control such companies and websites and are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of websites that we do not own or control.
How We Protect and Retain Your Information
We use reasonable industry-accepted technology and controls to protect your data from disclosure to unauthorized third parties. Although these measures are typically effective, use of the Internet and related computer systems is inherently vulnerable to unauthorized access or “hacking.” No guarantee can be given that all information you provide to us will not be accessed by unauthorized persons. Thus, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
We retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of such revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.

Disqus Privacy Policy
Updated January 2, 2025
This Privacy Policy tells you how Disqus collects, uses, sells, discloses and protects data relating to you in connection with our Service (as defined below), as well as your choices regarding our collection and use of this data.
a. Overview. Disqus offers an online public comment sharing platform where users login and create profiles to participate in conversations with peers and enjoy an interactive experience. Use of our platform and software (collectively the “Service”)  is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The Service is a public platform and Disqus or others may search for, see, use, or re-post any of your User Content (as defined in our Terms of Use) that you post through the Service. Disqus uses and shares personal data for marketing purposes, including cross-contest behavioral advertising.
b. Applicability and third-party websites and services. Disqus offers an online commenting service that other websites use to enable discussion among their users. This Privacy Policy applies to the data Disqus collects about users of the Service and does not apply to the data collection practices of any website that uses the Service or other website linked to from the Service. Your browsing activity and interaction with any other website, including those that you link to from the Service, is subject to that website's privacy policy.
c. Your Privacy Rights.  You have the right to ask us for a copy of the data we have collected about you, to have it corrected if it is demonstrably inaccurate, to have it deleted, and to restrict the collection and use of any sensitive personal information.  You can exercise those rights here.
d. Children’s Privacy. The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or sell personal information from children under 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an account on the service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete it. If you believe that we might have collected personal information from a child under 16, please contact us.
a. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about a person that can be linked back to that person, or their device. Not all data can be linked back to you, for instance when it becomes part of a statistical model but isn’t maintained at an individual level, or when it is anonymized, meaning it still has some individual attributes, but it can’t be linked to the person they came from (e.g. a postal code, gender, and broad interest categories).  We collect, use, and share both personal data and these other types of data.
b. We collect, use, store and transfer the following kinds of personal data about you:
Identity Data
includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, date of birth, email address, telephone number, and mailing address.
Technical Data
includes internet protocol (IP) address, unique Cookie ID, Device ID, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access the Service.
Profile Data
includes your username and password, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses, marital status, gender, title.
Usage Data
includes information about how you use the Service, and the content of comments that you post.
Aggregated Data
includes statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Sensitive Personal

However, if you make comments using the Service that include such data about yourself it will be publicly available and may be processed by Disqus or others.

We may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links or advertisements are clicked by recipients.
Third parties or publicly available sources.
We may obtain or receive personal data about you from analytics providers such as Google that may process data from EEA residents outside the EEA, advertising partners listed
here
, third-party data brokers who sell personal data, and Identity and Contact Data from third party connections or log-ins for example Facebook Connect, Google or Twitter by “following”, “liking” or linking your account to the Service.
Advertising is the predominant way Disqus makes money. Advertising revenue allows Disqus to operate, support and improve the Service. Disqus uses, and also shares with third party ad partners and affiliates who use cookie IDs, device IDs (including mobile), hashed email addresses, IP address, ISP and browser information, demographic or interest data, content viewed and actions taken on the Service or Partner Sites, including information about the websites you’ve viewed and advertisements you’ve interacted within order to provide you with more relevant advertising targeted to your preferences and interests derived from your interaction with the Service, Partner Sites or other third party websites.

Email marketing messages may be tailored to your interests based on the information described above in this section, for information about how to opt-out and utilize our “Do Not Sell or Share” option please click

.
We partner and share data with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you or your business.  Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, over time, (including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, addressable TV, or other media), for marketing, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
Privacy laws in the European Economic Area (EEA) and certain other countries require us to identify the “legal basis” for our use of personal data. We use personal data as you have consented for us to do so, or as necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), but only where your rights and interests are not negatively impacted. We may also use it where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or to protect the health, safety, or legal rights of any person.
We have set out below, in a table format, a description of the ways we use personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.
Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you have any additional questions.

We also share personal data with external third parties for similar purposes.  These third parties may include other companies who participate in cross-context behavioral advertising, data brokers, our clients, our service providers (e.g., companies who provide web hosting or analytics services), or as required to comply with law enforcement requests.

We may also engage in limited data sharing to evaluate and test our potential data partners. Where such testing takes place, the data is encrypted or encoded before it is shared. Furthermore, such sharing is subject to appropriate contractual provisions and the data is promptly deleted after the testing is completed.
In addition, we may access, preserve, and disclose your personal data, including your Identity, Contact, or Technical data, if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law enforcement requests and legal process. We may also access, preserve, and disclose such personal data if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety, or to investigate fraud.

CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(

).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
