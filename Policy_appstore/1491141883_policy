The recording of location, route and activity data is necessary for the provision of the Kinto Join Carpooling Service as described in the T&Cs, since without it we cannot verify your mode of travel to match you with incentives offered by your employer as part of a Corporate Carpooling Program or match you with potential travel partners based on your preferred route(s) and time of travel.

(However, no location data is transferred via Bluetooth). We also use this data to identify other users who wish to commute in the same direction to match the users and allow the building of carpools.

The date and time you last logged in may also be displayed but you can turn this off, if you wish. The sharing of information is necessary for the performance of the services. Accordingly, you should not join any carpooling group if you do not wish for your information to be shared with the other members of the group.

· Corporate Carpooling Program
We may share your Personal Data with your employer if you participate in a Corporate Carpooling Program.
These programs require users to register as an employee of a Corporate Carpooling Program customer using an email address associated with their employer’s business and participation allows the employers to offer benefits to their employees who choose to use more environmentally-friendly modes of transportation, such as carpools, using public transport or riding a bicycle to and from work. Employee participation in the carpooling program is optional. If you sign up, your employer may provide you with certain benefits depending on whether and how often you participate in carpools and use these services to build carpools.
We only share your Personal Data that is necessary to run the App or the Website and the App and for you to receive the incentives or benefits that may be offered by your employer, such as premium reserved parking, free coffees, lunch, or other incentives as deemed appropriate by your employer.

You will be allocated a unique user ID and username, and we will illustrate to your employer through the carpooling dashboard on the Website your carpooling activities.

We do not share your location data with your employer. We do not inform your employer about who you are carpooling with. However, you should note that your employer may be able to establish these details from the information we do provide to them, depending on the nature of the particular Corporate Carpooling Program and the number of other individuals who participate in that Corporate Carpooling Program.
· Data transfer due to legal obligation
If we are obligated to transfer your data to a third party based on a legal obligation or in order to comply with applicable laws and governmental bodies, we will only do so in accordance with applicable laws (including the DPA 2018 and the UK GDPR). This may include for example, defense or pursuit of our legal claims involving your use of the carpooling services, investigate fraud, cooperating with criminal investigations, such as compliance with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or to the data protection supervisory authority.

11. How long we will keep your Personal Data
We will only keep your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, which may include satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The retention period depends on the type of Personal Data and the reason we are processing it. Further details of retention periods are set out in the Schedule of Processing which can be found at the end of this document.
When calculating the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we consider the nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we are processing the Personal Data, and any applicable statutory retention periods.

In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will take steps to mitigate any loss or destruction of data and, if required, will notify you and any applicable authority of such a breach.
Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your Personal Data, you will appreciate that the transmission of data over the internet (including by email) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to or by us.

The transfer and processing of Personal Data to our service providers in Serbia is in compliance with the requirements of the UK GDPR regarding international transfers of Personal Data and the appointment of processors.
