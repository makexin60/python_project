Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 6, 2022
Introduction
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) describes how Jenny Vi Pham LLC (collectively, "Jenny Vi Pham LLC," "our," "us," or "we") collects, uses, shares, and protects information about your use of our website at www.micahyujin.org (the “Site”), mobile applications (“Apps”), and any other online service locations where this Privacy Policy is posted (we refer to the Site, Apps, and other service locations, and the features, content, and software made available through them, collectively, as the “Service” or “Services”). This Policy also details the choices you have regarding the use and disclosure of information about you collected through the Services.
This Policy applies to our Services on which we display or post a direct link to this privacy policy.
Please read this entire Privacy Policy before using any of our Services. By using our Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Each time you use our Services, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.
1. What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use and Share It?
In general, we collect information in three different ways: i) when you provide it to us, ii) automatically when you use our Services, and iii) from service providers and third parties.
i.
Information You Provide
Depending on how you interact with our Services, you may be asked to provide certain kinds of information in order to gain access to our Services. For example, if you want to make a purchase through one of the third-party partner platforms we utilize, you will be asked to provide payment-related information (such as your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the transaction.
We also collect information you voluntarily provide to sign up for email alerts, social features such as forums and chat on our Patreon page, our Ko-Fi page, and Discord server, registration and subscription to our Patreon to gain access to our Discord server and early access to pre-release content and beta builds of our games, or contacting us via email with technical requests or questions. We collect whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar instances.
ii.
Information We Collect Automatically
Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our Services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins, or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, game data processing, or other device or system-related specifications) may be transmitted to us. The IP address information that we collect may indicate to us the general location of your device.
Please note that the third-party platforms through which we sell our games may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of our Services. That collection of information is subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.
iii.
Information Collected from Third Parties
In some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third-party platforms in connection with your use of our Services or your interactions with us on other platforms. For example, if you purchase one of our games or game content from a third-party platform (like Steam), the company that operates that website or service may share some information with us in accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on the other company’s website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with us, so please be sure to review and update them regularly.
iv.

In addition to the uses described above, we may use personal information that we collect for other purposes that are disclosed to you at the time we collect the information, or with your consent.

Please note, however, that this Policy does not restrict our ability to process information that does not individually identify you, and we may use and disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any reason permitted by law.
v.
How We Share Your Information
We may share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:
•
when we engage third parties to perform services on our behalf, such services include maintenance, hosting, data storage, security, analytics and data analysis, payment processing, marketing, email and text message distribution, customer service, and surveys and sweepstakes;
•
when you communicate with us by email, submit an online form through our Services, purchase a product or service, or otherwise submit a request through our Services;
•

•
where necessary to operate our Services, your personal information and the contents of all of your online communications on or through our Services may be accessed and monitored:

to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations;
o
to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action;
o
in order to protect the rights or property of Jenny Pham LLC, including to enforce our Services' Terms of Service [hyperlink to TOS page];
o
when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a subpoena, court order, or search warrant);
o
where we believe our Services are being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and risk management; and
o
when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person, or the public generally.

•
when you register to use a service co-branded by Jenny Vi Pham LLC and other companies with which we partner, we may share the personal information you provide with such companies; in this instance, both our Privacy Policy and the partner's privacy policy will apply;
We may share personal information about you for any other purpose(s) disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or with your consent.
We may also share information that does not identify you with third parties, including aggregate or de-identified information. Third parties you interact with through our Services may have different privacy practices than us, so we encourage you to review their privacy policies before sharing your information with them.
2. Your Choices Regarding Data Collection
You have choices over the personal information we collect. The specific choices available to you often vary depending on the exact nature of our relationship with you, such as the Services you are using and if a third-party platform is acting as an intermediary. Common examples include:
•
You can request that we provide access to, or that we correct or delete, personal information we’ve collected from you. Please submit requests to access, update, or delete personal information by reaching out to us at jennyvipham@gmail.com. Please note that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request.
•
You can change your privacy settings on other parties’ websites (such as social networks) or platforms to limit the information they may share with us.
•
You can change your browser or mobile device settings to block, manage, delete, or limit tracking technologies like cookies.
Some parts of the world provide individuals with specific choices related to their personal information by right under local law.
3. Storing Personal Information
We retain your personal information as needed to provide you with our Services. Additionally, we may retain personal information for however long is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Service [hyperlink to TOS page] or any other contract entered into between you and us, or if it is not technically feasible to delete your personal information.
4. Protecting Personal Information
We use reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, technical, and data security procedures and controls to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, misuse, and alteration.
We use third-party service providers to manage credit card and payment processing. These service providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card and payment processing on our behalf. When you enter payment information to be processed by our third-party service providers, we do not store it on our systems.
It is important to remember, however, that no system can guarantee 100% security at all times. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of information stored on or transmitted to or from our Services. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems. When disclosing any personal information, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the public and, consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. Accordingly, you should carefully consider if you want to submit sensitive information that you would not want disclosed to the public and should recognize that your use of the Internet and our Services is solely at your risk. You are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy for all your personal information.
5. Linked Websites and Services
Our Services may link to other sites or services operated by our affiliates or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties. We do not exercise control over third-party sites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties. Once you leave our Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party's site or service. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
We may also provide social media features on our Services that enable you to share personal information with your social network(s) and to interact with our Services. Depending on the features, your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media site(s) with which you interact.
6. California Privacy Rights
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California resident, you may have the right to: (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose; (2) request deletion of your personal information; (3) opt out of sale of your personal information (if any); and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
You or your authorized agent may make these requests by contacting us as at jennyvipham@gmail.com. Please note that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you gave that person authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information, as described in the CCPA:

Other “personal information” as defined under California law (like your credit or debit card information); and
•
Inferences drawn from any of these categories (for example, about the genres of games you may prefer to play based on your purchase history).
•
For details about the precise data points we collect and the categories of sources where we got that information, please see “What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use and Share It?” above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in “How We Use Your Information” above.
Jenny Vi Pham LLC does not sell the personal information we collect. We do, however, disclose personal information as described in this policy (see “How We Share Your Information” above). In the past 12 months, we have disclosed personal information to the following categories of recipients:
•
Other users (for example, if you use chat or social features on the Jenny Vi Pham Patreon forum or ERROR143 Discord server or Ko-Fi forum);
•
Service providers (as described in “How Do We Share Information?” above);

Government entities or other third parties in response to a legal request.
7. Other Applicable California Privacy Rights
Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of your personal information with third parties. If you reside in California and you have provided us with your personal information, you may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at jennyvipham@gmail.com with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line and allow 30 days for a response. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.
In accordance with Section 22581 of the California Business and Professions Code if you are a California resident under the age of 18, you may request and obtain the removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please email us at jennyvipham@gmail.com with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line. Please specify the Service(s) to which your removal request relates, including any URLs where the content or information is posted, and the specific content or information you posted for which you are requesting removal. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
8. European Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, you have certain rights regarding how your personal data is processed. You may opt-out of us processing your personal information (or providing it to third parties to process) for direct marketing purposes (including promotional e-mails and other forms of direct marketing) or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. If you wish to exercise this choice, please e-mail us at jennyvipham@gmail.com. We will try to make the requested changes in our Services and systems as soon as reasonably practical.
You also have the right to make a complaint against us by contacting your local supervisory authority for data protection (if one exists in your country). We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you contact a data protection regulator, and ask that you direct your complaint to us first.
Please reach out to us at jennyvipham@gmail.com to exercise any of these rights or with any relevant concerns you may have. You can find more details about your local Data Protection Authority as follows:

9. Children's and Minor's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 or utilize plug-ins or ad networks that collect personal information through child-directed third-party websites or online services. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete such information.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, you can send an email to jennyvipham@gmail.com. Please be sure to identify the specific Service about which you have a question or concern and provide information about how we can contact you.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time and, if we do, we will update it on this page and modify the "Last Updated" date. If our information practices change in a significant way, you will be provided notice by means of notice on our Sites or otherwise in writing. Because our Privacy Policy can change at any time, we encourage you to reread it periodically to see if there have been any changes that affect you. If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised privacy policy, you will need to terminate your usage of our Services. Your use of our Services following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you through our Services after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
12. Conflicts
Depending on the specific Service you are using or specific interactions you have with us, we may provide different or supplemental privacy statements that describe and govern how we use your personal information. When we do so, those different or supplemental privacy statements apply to that specific Service you are using or those specific interactions you have with us.
If there is any conflict between the English version of our Privacy Statement and a version translated in another language, the English version controls.
