Privacy Policy
We like to keep things simple:
We intentionally do not use third-party analytics or ads in our apps, and collect no user data nor cookies of any sort. We are committed to making sure that this remains the case.
Your settings & data are stored securely on your own devices, and, where appropriate, you may choose to back-up or sync through iCloud.
This policy is effective from May 25th 2018.
