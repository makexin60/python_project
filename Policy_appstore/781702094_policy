Information We Collect & How We Use It
We collect and use information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect Directly From You
Contact and Registration Information
We collect certain information on our Services from visitors and customers who wish to obtain information or support, purchase our Products, or use our Services (e.g., booking a Showroom or Customer Acquisition Appointment). Information we collect may include your username and password, and contact information, such as, first name, last name, shipping address, telephone number, and email address ("Registration Information"), or other information that you submit to us. Registration Information is used to establish an account, and/or provide the requested Product, Services, or information, and to contact prospective and current customers for purposes of direct marketing of our current and future products and services. In accordance with applicable legal requirements, when you request and/or agree to receive marketing emails, newsletters, or similar communications, or when you have purchased Products or Services, or expressed interest in such Products or Services (e.g., by attending a showroom or customer acquisition appointment), we will use your Registration Information for purposes of direct marketing of our current and future Services, and to send you communications via email or SMS, such as for marketing or information and operational purposes (including, but not limited to, account management, customer service, or system maintenance).
Billing Information
If you wish to purchase a Product or Service through the Services, you will be required to provide information which may include a billing address, payment method, credit card number, expiration date, card verification value, and similar information ("Billing Information"). We directly collect and use Billing Information to support our checkout process and improve our Services, such as personalizing your checkout process and options. Billing Information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processor operating as our agent.
Customer Purchase and Browsing Data
We collect and use the information we have about your past purchases and browsing activity to create customer profiles and deliver personalized user experiences and product recommendations.
Customer Relationship Data & Customer Submitted Information
We use an internal customer relationship management (“CRM”) system to access and use order history information as well as Product and interaction preferences. Our private client advisors or our other team members may also request and receive characteristics information about you, such as your measurements, style and fit preferences, birthday, and other communications between you and Moda Operandi or those acting on our behalf (collectively, “Customer Relationship Data”) to help us provide you with our Services. Any information provided to/or collected by us for these purposes will be used to provide our Services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may request that we delete your Customer Relationship Data. To submit a request, please see

below.
We also collect information that you submit to us, such as when you communicate with our Care team, private client advisors, or other Moda employees, representatives, agents, or third parties providing services on our behalf. This includes information that you submit when you engage in our online customer service chat functionality. These chats may be recorded and stored by us and our third-party chat service providers for quality and assurance purposes. In addition, from time to time we may contact you to participate in optional surveys—if you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include contact details and questions about your preferences.
Information We Collect Passively
When you use our Services, we may passively collect a variety of information about you, your devices, and your interactions with our Services.
Logging
Like many online and digital services, we (or third parties acting on our behalf) automatically receive and record certain information about visitors and users of our Services. Our servers and IT applications automatically collect certain information on traffic, usage and patterns, and store it in log files. The information we collect for this purpose includes IP addresses, user agent information (such as your browser type), internet service provider, entry/exit pages, date and time stamps, clickstream information, and other session activity. We analyze this information so we can better understand trends, administer and improve the Services, and make certain decisions in the interest of our customers.
Cookies
We use cookies and similar technologies to help us collect information about your use of our Services. Cookies are small files sent to your device by us that help us better tailor our Services to you. A cookie is unique to your browser. Some cookies are session-based and only last while your browser is open, while others are persistent and last until you or your browser deletes them.
We use cookies for a number of reasons to help us better personalize your experience and improve our Services. Some cookies may be necessary for us to provide you with certain features or the Services that you request, such as logging into your account—if you disable these cookies, certain features or Services may not function as expected. We also may use cookies to record some of your choices and settings, which help us personalize your experience with our Services (for example, remembering your name on our Site or Mobile App). Some of the cookies from our Site and Mobile App come from companies that help us process data or provide us with certain services, such as performance and analytical insights. For more information about our use of third-party cookies, please see the "

" section below. To learn more about cookies and how to manage or delete them, please visit

We may also use web beacons or other technologies to help us manage content on the Services, for example, to track what content is most interacted with. We may use these technologies to track online movement of our customers and visitors/users to our Site or Mobile App, but in contrast to cookies (which are stored on a local hard drive), these technologies are embedded in our Site or the Mobile App. We may also use these technologies in our emails to see what emails are opened so we can gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, such as our marketing campaigns.
De-Identified Data
In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and usage of our Services, we may de-identify the information we collect from and about you so that such information can no longer be tied to you personally (“De-Identified Data”). We may analyze, use, or disclose such De-Identified Data for any purpose, including, but not limited to, operating, maintaining, managing, and improving our Services, marketing, improving our Products, and disclosing such information to our agents, business partners, affiliates, or any other third party. We may also disclose De-Identified Data and related user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Internal and Services-Related Usage
We use your information to continue improving and developing Products and Services that we may offer you, and to optimize your experience with us. We use and retain the information we collect to analyze, improve, and facilitate the development of our Services, including: to analyze interactions with and performance of our Services; to better understand your use of the Services and of our customers and visitors; to debug and identify errors that impair functionality; to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; for research and development; and to improve, supplement, or enhance our Services, or develop new products and services.
Displaying to Other Customers or Users
Any content that you post in a publicly viewable forum on our Services (for example, in a public chat, forum, or in a Product review) may be publicly displayed on our Site, Mobile App, or otherwise through our Services and viewable by third parties, who may be able to see some or all of the content that you post and other information about you, such as your name or username that you use to post such information. Moda is not responsible for the content that you post or the privacy practices of other visitors or customers who may view and use information that you post in such public forums.
Information From Third Parties
We may collect information about you from third parties or supplement the information we collect from you with additional records received from third parties. We also collect information from third parties to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you, and to inform our commercial and operational decisions.
Analytics Information
We use third-party service providers on the Site and the Mobile App (such as Google Analytics and Google Optimize) to evaluate your use of the Site and Mobile App, compile reports on activity (based on the collection of IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Site and Mobile App you visit, number of links clicked, search terms, and other similar usage data), and/or analyze performance metrics. These parties may use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze and provide us with reports and/or data.

Remarketing & Advertising
We partner with third-party advertising companies and marketing organizations (“Ad Network Partners”) to either display advertising on our Site or Mobile App which we believe will be of interest to you, or to display our advertising on other sites or apps. Our Ad Network Partners use cookies and web beacons (for example, pixels) and may collect certain data typically associated with online identifiers, including your email, email hash, user ID, session ID, cookie ID, browser type, mobile device, referring URL, member ID, city, country, demographic data, and information about your activities on our Site or Mobile App and other web sites and apps to provide you targeted advertising based upon your consumer profile.

Social Media Platforms and Interactive Features
Our Services may include or contain certain social media plug-ins or other interactive features provided by various third-party platforms, such as the ability to post to Facebook, create a Pinterest board, or view and engage in a live-streamed event. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie (or use similar technologies) to enable the feature to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them. If you already use these features or platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using the Services.

Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. We “share” information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services.
