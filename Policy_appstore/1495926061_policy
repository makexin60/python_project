GDPR
). Appendix 1 outlines the details of the additional information and rights that individuals located in the EU and the UK have as well as information on how we process the personal information of individuals located in the EU and the UK. Appendix 2 contains additional information about our use of personal information from individuals who are not covered by the GDPR (i.e. individuals located in Australia, anywhere in the United States, and other locations outside of the UK and EU). Appendix 3 discloses additional information and data rights provided to individuals who reside in specific jurisdictions within the United States that have enacted their own applicable privacy laws.
‍
"Personal information" as used in this Privacy Policy means information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, and includes anything defined as personal information, personal data under the GDPR, personally identifiable information or similar terms under applicable law.

We do not knowingly collect, solicit, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided personal information to us without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information immediately.
‍
We remind and encourage all parents to check and monitor their children’s online activities. Under United States law, parents have the right to review and have deleted any personal information we may have inadvertently collected from their children, and refuse to permit further collection of that information.

Where another party with their own relationship with you has collected and uses your personal information for their own purposes or as an 'independent controller' - for example, an app developer who has integrated our Services (such as Passport) into their own products and services, who may use your personal information on the basis of their own separate agreement with you - we are not in control of and will not be responsible for their actions and decisions with respect to your personal information, including whether they disclose it to third parties in countries that do not have substantially similar protection of your personal information as Australian privacy laws.
‍
When transferring your personal information out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the UK, we will use any relevant contractual agreement approved by the competent authorities as a basis for the transfer (e.g. the Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers from the EEA or the International Data Transfer Agreement for transfers from the UK).  Where these contractual agreements are not sufficient to ensure an adequate level of data protection at the recipient, we will implement supplemental safeguards. Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the European Economic Area and/or the United Kingdom.

Cookies, Google Analytics and Web Beacons
‍
We may use cookies on our online Services from time to time. Cookies are text  files  placed  in  your  computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information. However, they do recognise you when you return to our online Services and allow third parties, such as Google and Facebook, to cause our advertisements to appear on your social media and online media feeds as part of our retargeting campaigns. If and when you choose to provide our online Services with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie and that information could potentially be used to identify you. It may be possible for us to identify you from information collected automatically from your visit(s) to our Services, for example, we will be able to identify you through your user name and password when you log into our Services. Further, if you access our Services via links in an email we have sent you, we will be able to identify you.
‍
You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our online Services. At this time, our websites do not respond to “do not track” signals, if received.
‍
We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time. Web beacons (also known as Clear GIFs) are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the visitor’s behaviour and collect data about the visitor’s viewing of a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
‍
We may use Google Analytics to collect and process data. To find out how Google uses data when you use third party websites or applications, please se
e www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
or any other URL Google may use from time to time. If you do not want your Site visit data reported by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. For more details on installing and uninstalling the add-on, please visit the Google Analytics opt-out page at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
Digital advertising and custom audiences
We also engage in online digital marketing. This means we may use personal information we know about you to better target ads. This section explains those activities in more detail, as well as your ability to opt out.
Custom audiences
We may use personal information we know about you (such as your name, email address, interests/attributes) to create 'audience lists' (sometimes called a 'custom audience' or 'segment'). These audience lists may contain: (1) individuals we have selected from our own marketing databases for an ad to be shown to; (2)individuals who we or our third party service providers have determined as 'lookalikes' (i.e. they share interests/attributes) based on a 'seed' of personal information that we provide (e.g. the seed may be a list of email addresses of individuals in our marketing databases who we believe are representative of the types of people we want to show an ad to); or (3)individuals who we or our third party service providers have determined as 'lookalikes' based on a 'seed' of information that is not personal information in our hands but may be personal information in the hands of the service provider (such as someone who the provider can identify as a previous visitor to our website, based on data they collect using technology such as cookies).
We use these audience lists to deliver specific ads only to the individuals on those lists, to ensure the ads and offers we show are more likely to be of interest to the people who see them. We may use and disclose those lists for advertising and marketing for our, and Immutable partners', products, services and special offers. When we do this, there may not always be a clear link in the ad shown to a person between the party whose ad is being displayed and Immutable. We will not directly disclose personal information to the Immutable partner in such a case, but may use the personal information we know about individuals who have a relationship with Immutable to build the relevant audience list for us, Immutable partners or our third party advertising service provider to use to display that ad.
The ads we show based on such audience lists may be displayed on our own platforms (such as our websites, games or applications), or on networks or platforms owned by third party advertising service providers such as Meta (Facebook). These audience lists (and therefore some personal information) may be disclosed to such third party advertising service providers so they can identify the appropriate users on their networks or platforms (or create the appropriate 'lookalike' sets) to display the ads to.
Where permitted by applicable laws, we may enable our 'lookalike' audience lists to be used by third party advertising service provider networks/platforms for Immutable partners to have their own ads delivered directly to that audience list. Any personal information in those audience lists will not be disclosed to the Immutable partner, but will be disclosed to the third party advertising service provider to deliver the ads for them.
Opting out from custom audiences
If you do not wish for us to deliver, or to facilitate Immutable partners to deliver, targeted online advertising to you, you may advise us at any time by contacting us using the details below. If you have opted out, where the final selection of each recipient on an audience list is within our control, we will ensure you are excluded from our audience lists and that the ad is not delivered to you based on any personal information we hold about you. You will still see ads, but these will not have been specifically selected for you and may not be as relevant to you.
However, while opting out with us will mean we ask our service providers to not deliver a targeted ad to you based on our audience lists and the personal information we hold, it may not always prevent our third party advertising service providers from using personal information they hold about you to deliver the ads we give to them as targeted online advertising to you. For example, they may show an ad to you because we asked for it to be delivered generally (and not through a custom audience list) to individuals with certain categories of interests. In order to stop those networks and platforms from providing targeted advertising to you where they determine the target audience, you may need to opt out directly via settings available to you on those networks or platforms (for example, for more information on Facebook custom audiences visit https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanationor to opt-out, go to the
Facebookad preferences page
).
Advertising networks
We also use network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Services, unaffiliated websites or other media (e.g. social networking platforms). This enables us and network advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use pixels, cookies, JavaScript, web beacons(including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content to you.These pixels, cookies and other technologies are governed by each entity’s specific privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. Where permitted by applicable laws, and unless you opt out, we may provide these advertisers within formation, including personal information, about you.
Opting out from targeted ads
If you do not wish for us to deliver, or to facilitate third parties to deliver, targeted online advertising to you, you may advise us at any time by contacting us using the details below.
You may also be able to opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to the DigitalAdvertising Alliance (DAA)
ConsumerChoice Page
for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies.You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer Opt-OutPage for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the
DAAConsumer Choice Page
or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Services or on other websites.  You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on a consumer choice website, your opt out may not be effective.
‍
Links to other websites
Our Services may contain links to other websites. We do not have any control over those websites and we are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any personal information which you provide whilst visiting those websites. Those websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy.
‍
Amendments
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. If you do not agree with our changes, please do not use the Services.
Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy and the conclusion of any legally required notice period means you accept those changes.

Appendix 1
Additional Information and Rights for Individuals Located in the EU or the UK
Under the GDPR individuals located in the EU or the UK have certain additional rights which apply to their personal information. Personal information under the GDPR is often referred to as personal data and is defined  as  information  relating  to  an identified or identifiable natural person (individual). This Appendix sets out the additional rights we give to individuals located in the EU and the UK, including how we process personal information lawfully, transparently and fairly. Please read the Privacy Policy above and this Appendix carefully and contact us at the details at the end of the Privacy Policy if you have any questions.
‍
What personal information is relevant?
This Appendix applies to the personal information set out in the Privacy Policy above. This includes any sensitive information also listed in the Privacy Policy above which is known as ‘special categories of data’ under the GDPR.
‍
Our commitment to you
Your personal information will:
be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner by us;
only be collected for the specific purposes we have identified in the ‘collection and use of personal information’ clause above and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have identified;
be collected in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which the personal information is processed;
be kept up to date, where it is possible and within our control to do so (please let us know if you would like us to correct any of your personal information);
be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only for so long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal information was collected; and
be processed securely and in a way that protects against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
‍
How we process personal information
We will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:
‍
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
‍
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
‍
Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
‍
Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Information although we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.
‍
You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us or by clicking on the unsubscription link in each marketing email you receive from us.
‍
We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
‍
If you refuse to provide us with certain Personal Information or if you provide us with incomplete or inaccurate information required for the performance of the contract or for compliance with a legal obligation, please be aware that we may not be able to provide or deliver to you all or parts of the service that you require.
‍
We only collect Special Categories of Personal Data where you have given your explicit consent, it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of other people or where you have deliberately made it public.
‍
See above in the main section of this Privacy Policy (under 'Purposes for which we will use your personal information - UK and EU') to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your Personal Information.
‍
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
‍
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.
‍
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your legal rights’ below for further information.
‍
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for analytics, research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this anonymised information indefinitely without further notice to you.
‍
Data Transfers
We may transfer your personal data to third parties located outside of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.  We will provide appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
‍
When transferring personal data out of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we will use either the "Standard Contractual Clauses” as approved by the European Commission or the United Kingdom Government (as applicable) or any other contractual agreement approved by the competent authorities as a basis for the transfer.
‍
Where these contractual agreements are not sufficient to ensure an adequate level of data protection at the recipient, we will implement supplemental safeguards.
‍
Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the European Economic Area and/or the United Kingdom.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information.
You have the right to:
‍
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Contact: https://support.immutable.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
‍
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
‍
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
‍
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
‍
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the
Information Commissioner’s Office
(ICO). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in the first instance.

Appendix 3
Additional Rights for Individuals Located in the US
The California Consumer Privacy Rights Act provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This Appendix sets out additional rights granted to residents of California, as well as to residents of other US jurisdictions such as Virginia and Colorado, as and when those jurisdictions enact applicable privacy legislation from time to time.
‍
Sale or Share of Your Personal Information
We do not “sell” or “share” your personal information, as the term is defined in the California Privacy Rights Act.
‍
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below in this Appendix for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for analytics, research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this anonymised information indefinitely without further notice to you.
‍
Your Right to Access, Delete, and Correct
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and validate your request, we will include a list of your personal information that may have been disclosed and the categories of third parties the information may have been disclosed to.
You may request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will review your request. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is proper and necessary or if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies.
You may also request that we correct any of your personal information that has become outdated or needs correction for any reason.
If your request is approved, we will delete, correct, or deidentify the relevant information and will direct our service providers to take similar action.
‍

If we reasonably require an extension we will inform you of the reason and extension period.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your data subject rights.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Verifiable Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
