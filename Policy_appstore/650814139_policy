Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
Tech Tent Limited trading as PostSnap collects some of your personal information in order to optimise your online shopping experience. This allows us to process your orders efficiently, send you relevant information and in the case of an issue or query it means that we can deal with such matters effectively and efficiently.
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and data and this Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store and use any personal data we collect from you when you interact with us by visiting our website and mobile app, including when you review and buy any of our products and services, sign up for an account or to receive our marketing communications, and interact with the articles published on our website and blog. It also tells you your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions. Capitalised terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms and Conditions.
This website is not intended for children below the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.
By using our website and services and providing personal information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our website and services.
We may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time and if we do we'll notify you of any significant changes by email, but we encourage you to come back and check this Privacy Policy whenever you wish. This Privacy Policy was last updated on 14 June 2024.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please email us at: team@postsnap.com
2. Who we are
We are Tech Tent Limited (hereafter referred to as "TT", "we", "our", or "us") and we trade as PostSnap. The www.postsnap.com website is owned by us and we utilise this website and mobile applications to interact with you.
TT is a company registered in Guernsey (No: 46701) and our registered address is: The Albany, South Esplanade, St Peter Port, GY1 1AQ, Guernsey. Our main trading address is Wilson House, 2 Lorne Park Road, Bournemouth. BH1 1JN, United Kingdom.
You have the right to make a Privacy related complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO and so please contact us by email in the first instance.
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Therefore, please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your interactions with us.
3. How we comply with the law on data protection
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data. This includes:
With consent
In specific situations, we may collect and process your data with your consent. For example, when you tick a box to receive email newsletters. When we collect your personal data in this way, we'll always make clear to you which data (for example an email address) is necessary in connection with a particular activity or service.
Contractual obligations
In some circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations. For example, if you purchase an item from us, we'll collect your contact details in order to deliver your purchase to you. These details will also be passed to our printer and delivery partners.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your personal data. For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement agencies if requested to do so.
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your personal data to pursue our legitimate business interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedoms or interests. For example, we may use your purchase history to send you, or make available to you, personalised offers.
We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products and services.
4. The type of personal data we collect
We collect the following types of information about you and your recipients:

Information from third parties we collect from you. For example, In order to take advantage of some of our services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them TT's products using our Services.)

This includes your friend's name and email address or mobile telephone number. We will automatically send your friend an email or text message inviting him or her to visit or download our Services. We will identify you in the referral invitation and we will only send your friend a single referral invitation. If your friend does not reply to the referral invitation we will not send your friend another message and we will delete the information you provide us with about your friend. We will only use the information you provide about your friend for the purpose of inviting your friend to visit or download our Services and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

6. How and why do we use your personal data?
Here's how we'll use your personal data and why
To process any orders that you make by using our apps or websites. If we don't collect your personal data during checkout, we won't be able to process your order and comply with our legal obligations. For example, your details may need to be passed to a third party to supply or deliver the product or service that you ordered and we may keep your details for a reasonable period afterwards in order to fulfil any contractual obligations such as refunds, resends and so on.
To respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the information you sent enables us to respond to your requests. We may also keep a record of these to inform any future communication with us and to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We do this on the basis of our contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate interests in providing you with the best service and understanding how we can improve our service based on your experience.
To protect our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. This includes using your personal data to maintain, update and safeguard your account. We'll also monitor your browsing activity with us to quickly identify and resolve any problems and protect the integrity of our apps and websites. We'll do all of this as part of our legitimate interest. For example, by checking your password when you login and using automated monitoring of IP addresses to identify possible fraudulent logins from unexpected locations.
To process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. This also helps to protect our customers from fraud. If we or our payment partners discover any criminal activity or alleged criminal activity through our use of fraud monitoring and suspicious transaction monitoring, we will process this data for the purposes of preventing or detecting unlawful acts. We aim to protect the individuals we interact with from criminal activities.
With your consent, we will use your personal data, preferences and details of your transactions to keep you informed by email, web, text, telephone, in-app messaging and through our contact centre about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts, promotions, events, competitions and so on. You are free to opt out of hearing from us by any of these channels at any time.
To send you communications required by law or which are necessary to inform you about our changes to the services we provide you. For example, price increases, updates to this Privacy Notice, product recall notices, and legally required information relating to your orders. These service messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email, in-app message or text message. If we do not use your personal data for these purposes, we would be unable to comply with our legal obligations.
To display the most interesting content to you on our websites or apps, we'll use data we hold about your favourite features and products and so on. We do so on the basis of your consent to receive app notifications and / or for our website to place cookies or similar technology on your device. For example, we might display a list of items you've recently looked at, or offer you recommendations based on your purchase history and any other data you've shared with us.
To administer any of our prize draws or competitions which you enter, based on your consent given at the time of entering.
To develop, test and improve the systems, services and products we provide to you. We'll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests.
For example, we'll record your browser's Session ID to help us understand more when you leave us online feedback about any problems you're having.
To comply with our contractual or legal obligations to share data with law enforcement. For example, when a court order is submitted to share data with law enforcement agencies or a court of law.
To send you survey and feedback requests to help improve our services. These messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. We have a legitimate interest to do so as this helps make our products or services more relevant to you. You are free to opt out of receiving these requests from us at any time by updating your preferences in your account or by unsubscribing from our emails.
To build a rich picture of who you are and what you like, and to inform our business decisions. We'll combine data captured from across our brands, third parties and data from publicly-available lists as we have described in the section "The type of personal data we collect". We'll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interest. For example, by combining this data, this will help us personalise your experience and decide which inspiration or content to share with you. We also use anonymised data from customer purchase histories to identify trends in different areas of the country.
Sometimes, we'll need to share your details with a third party who is providing a service (such as delivery couriers). Without sharing your personal data, we'd be unable to fulfil your orders.
We use your personal data to:
Operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of, our Services
Communicate with you about our Services, for example, to respond to your inquiries
Fulfil your purchases
Provide you will order and billing information
Allow you to participate in competitions or promotions and to administer such activities

8. The storage and security of your personal data
We know how much data security matters to all our customers. With this in mind we will treat your data with the utmost care and take all appropriate steps to protect it.

Access to your personal data is password-protected, and sensitive data such as payment card information is secured and tokenised by our payment partners to ensure it is protected.
We regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out penetration testing to identify ways to further strengthen security.
By using or accessing our Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree that your personal and purchase information may be stored and processed in the United Kingdom, Guernsey or any other country in which TT or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Please note that we may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, service providers or other third parties across borders, from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the United States, European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United Kingdom or Guernsey Laws, you should be aware that we may transfer information about you, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you expressly consent to (a) the transfer of information to the United Kingdom and / or Guernsey or any other country in which TT or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers and/or business partners maintain facilities; and (b) the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Notice.
We care about the security of your information, and use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Services. Any payment transactions undertaken from our Services are encrypted using SSL technology. The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain our Services. All TT personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique minimum seven-character password which must include at least one number) to restrict access to certain parts of our Services and to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from us, at all times. We ask you not to share your password and credit / debit card details including security CVV number with anyone else. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on our Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. You acknowledge and agree that you use, and provide information to our Services at your own risk. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third-party sites and services that you add to our Services, such as social networks. PGL is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. You must be aware that you should always log out of your account when you have finished using our Services.
In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we'll only keep it for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.
9. Where your personal data may be processed
Sometimes we will need to share your personal data with third parties and suppliers outside the European Economic Area (EEA), such as Australia or the USA.
International orders
If you are based outside the UK and place an order with us, we will transfer the personal data that we collect from you to us in the UK.
Protecting your data outside the EEA
The EEA includes all EU Member countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third-party data processors in countries that are outside the EEA. For example, this might be required in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details or provide support services. If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the EEA. For example, our contracts with third parties stipulate the standards they must follow at all times. If you wish for more information about these contracts, please contact us by email.
Any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws and we will treat the information under the guiding principles of this Privacy Notice.
