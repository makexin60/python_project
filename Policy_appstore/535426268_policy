The information you provide us may include your name, email address, physical address, home and mobile phone numbers, contact details, financial information about your income and wealth, identification information such as National Insurance or National Identification number, date of birth, IP address, device ID, MAC address, professional and employment details, records of products and services you’ve obtained or applied for, trading history and other analogous personal information.
Information we collect about you
We will also collect information about you through your use of this website, the iOS or Android application (Apps)  and our platform. This information may include site areas visited, pages viewed, frequency and duration of visits.
Information we receive from other sources
We may also collect your personal information from third parties, including, for example, business partners, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies and third-party marketing companies or through publicly available sources.
Monitoring of communications
Subject to applicable laws, we will monitor and record your calls, emails, text messages, app and digital communications, social media messages and other communications in relation to your dealings with us. We will do this for regulatory compliance, crime prevention and detection purposes, to protect the security of our communications systems and procedures, for quality control and staff training, and so we can provide you with a record of what’s been said when you require one. We will also monitor activities on your account where necessary for these reasons and this is justified by our legitimate interests or our legal obligations.
Why we collect your information
CMC Markets collects your personal information in order to provide you with our products and services, to establish and manage your account and to comply with the law. By collecting your information, CMC Markets is able to monitor and improve the services we offer to our existing and potential clients.
How we use your information
CMC Markets may use your personal information for one or more of the following purposes:
To provide the services to you that you have requested including processing transactions, and customer support;
To verify your identity when you contact us;
To conduct security operations such as using your IP address to verify your identity when you log on to your account;

You can do this by changing your marketing preferences and privacy settings when you log in to your account; using the unsubscribe link provided in relevant emails we send you, or you can also opt out of receiving marketing communications by contacting the customer service team.

When you exercise your rights under data protection law and make requests;
For compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and related disclosures;
For activities relating to the prevention, detection and investigation of crime;
For establishment and defence of legal rights;
To verify your identity,  fraud prevention and anti-money laundering checks; and

How we protect your information
CMC Markets is committed to protecting the privacy of all personal information that CMC Markets obtains from you.
We continue to adopt industry and information security best practices to protect your personal information and ensure that unauthorised persons do not access it. Measures include encryption of data during transmission, strong authentication mechanisms, cybersecurity processes and secure access to machines and data.
We train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer data and the privacy of individuals.
How we protect your information in data transfers

How you can protect your information
Just as at CMC Markets, you should care about the security of your personal data. Do not give your security details to log in to your account, such as passwords or passcodes, to anyone else. If you feel someone may have gained knowledge of your login details, please contact us so we can support you and protect you and your information.
Additionally, we recommend securing your devices with a password or passcode. If you use our mobile app, we recommend that you enable the use of Touch ID or Face ID.
How long we hold your information
We will remove any personal information that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records when we consider that that personal information is no longer required. This could be a period of seven years after our business relationship with you has ended.
However, we may need to maintain certain records for a longer period, for example, where we are required to hold your personal information for regulatory or legal purposes, to provide you with the services you have requested or to maintain adequate business records.​
