In the event you decide to verify your account using our ‘Dubizzle Verified’ feature, we will also process a copy of your Identification Card with all information included on it (including your Identification Card number, date of birth, nationality, and gender).

We may also be required to share your personal information with government authorities in the country where you seek to obtain employment i.e. for work permit or visa purposes.
