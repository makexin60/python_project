8. Storage period
8.1 General

10. For California residents

If you are a resident of California USA, the California Consumer Privacy Act will protect you.
This is how:

Please see section 2, 3, 4 and 5 above for information on categories of information collected and its sources, purposes of the processing, categories of third parties with whom we share personal information and what information we collect.
b)    Sale.
If you sign up for an account with
nRF Cloud
you may be offered a subscription to a global eSIM mobile data provider with a time limited roaming service, free of charge.
