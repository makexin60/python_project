1 REGISTRATION FOR EVENIUM SERVICES
1.1 Internet Connection
The USER must have access to the internet.
EVENIUM does not guarantee the compatibility of EVENIUM SITES with all internet browsers and operating systems and has no obligation to the USER regarding this.  Any potential charges relating to this access are the responsibility of the USER in their entirety.
Furthermore, the USER must possess all necessary hardware required to access the internet or mobile network. The costs of acquisition of said hardware are the exclusive responsibility of the USER.
1.2 Registration Conditions
The USER must create an account to access EVENIUM SERVICES.  They are then asked to :
Complete the online registration form
Restate their acceptance of the TCUS
Choose a USERNAME and if needed a PASSWORD which is unique to them.
In registering, the USER agrees to provide complete, accurate, up to date and truthful information and to inform EVENIUM without delay of any alteration to said information.
1.3 Username and Password
A USERNAME and PASSWORD with an adequate level of security, should be chosen by the USER when they create their account to allow them to access all EVENIUM SERVICES and their PROFILE.
A temporary USERNAME and PASSWORD can also be sent to the USER allowing them to participate in an event which they were invited to by someone using their email address. The USER should, if necessary, create an account in order to participate in an event. It is also possible for the USER to use their normal USERNAME and PASSWORD.
Certain EVENIUM SERVICES are accessible without a password. This is at the USER’S risk. If a password hasn’t been chosen, the USER will be warned of this via email each time they access their account. EVENIUM takes no responsibility if a third party uses the USER’S account and the USER hereby acknowledges this fact.
In all cases the system automatically checks that the USERNAME and, if applicable, the PASSWORD match.  For security and confidentiality reasons, only the combination of these two codes will allow the USER to access all EVENIUM SERVICES and their PROFILE.
The USERNAME and PASSWORD act as proof of identity of the USER, and USER is responsible for all action taken while accessing EVENIUM SERVICES or their PROFILE using their USERNAME and PASSWORD.
The USER is responsible for keeping their USERNAME and PASSWORD private, and thus the activities which may be carried out under this USERNAME. They alone bear responsibility for the consequences arising from use by third parties with knowledge of these details.
The USER agrees not to authorize third parties to use their account, their USERNAME and PASSWORD at any time, and to inform EVENIUM immediately of any non-authorized use, actual or suspected, of their accounts, USERNAME and/or PASSWORD, or of any other breach or suspected breach.
EVENIUM reserves the right to change or update the identification process at its sole discretion.
The USERNAME and PASSWORD are strictly personal and non-transferable.
EVENIUM reserves the right to cancel any account which has been used by a non-authorized party or by any individual other than the USER with whom this USERNAME and PASSWORD are associated.
1.4 Facebook / Google / LinkedIn Usernames
In order to promote linking and optimize EVENIUM SERVICES, the USER is informed that an aggregation service is available.
If the USER has expressly accepted the aggregation service, they can connect to EVENIUM SERVICES using the login details, USERNAME and PASSWORD excluded, of secondary sites selected by EVENIUM.
The USER is informed that in the interests of aggregation EVENIUM can also access a range of basic information, notably concerning their account, their profile (name, profile picture, gender, networks, username), their networks, their interests, the groups they belong to, their list of friends and other information that the USER has provided or communicated on these secondary sites, which the USER expressly and unreservedly accepts.
1.5 Profile
When creating an ACCOUNT, the USER is asked to provide a range of PERSONAL DATA.
The USER is informed that they can choose whether to provide this PERSONAL DATA, but if they refuse, it is not certain that they will be able to use EVENIUM SERVICES or participate in all events.
The USER is duly informed and accepts that from the moment they put this information online, it will be kept by EVENIUM and treated in accordance with the conditions and to the ends outlined below (see article 4).
The USER is also informed that the information they put online, for example their name, and if required their company and job title (but not their email address) will be visible to other USERS or the public under the conditions described below (see article 3).
As far as the USER has supplied their connection details to secondary sites selected by EVENIUM, and accepted aggregation, their profile may be merged directly with those created on said secondary sites through the import of PERSONAL DATA of said accounts.
The USER can, if desired, alter or delete the information which has been collected via their PROFILE.
1.6 Children’s Protection
It is a requirement that the USER be an adult with full legal capacity, except in specific educational situations as described below. Notably, an ORGANIZER must not solicit nor invite any minor to register or use any of the EVENIUM SERVICES. A PARTICIPANT must not register any minor as an additional PARTICIPANT.
In the case of an EVENT in the field of education, organized by an ORGANIZER who represents an entity officially recognized as an educational institution, then participants to this EVENT who are minors are allowed to become USERS of the EVENIUM SERVICES, for limited usage as follows. These minor USERS cannot be ORGANIZERS, and they agree not to use EVENIUM SERVICES outside of educational events. The ORGANIZER is responsible for ensuring that the EVENT and the processing of USER information abide by all local laws, notably the laws related to child protection. The ORGANIZER is responsible for collecting authorizations from the parents or guardians of every minor USER, as required to comply with local laws. The ORGANIZER should refrain from collecting personal information concerning children and should, as much as possible, use the parent or guardian information instead.
A Parent or Guardian can request access to their child’s data at anytime, as well as request updates to or deletion of their child’s data, by sending an email request to
account-data-update@evenium.com
, with an official identification and a legal proof of their relationship to the minor USER.
2 USE OF EVENIUM SERVICES
2.1 Provision of Evenium Services
Once registered, the USER can start to use EVENIUM SERVICES, allowing them notably to :
organize EVENTS,
participate in EVENTS whilst interacting with other PARTICIPANTS and/or ORGANIZERS and/or speakers and publishing CONTENT, including notably comments and photos etc.
2.2 Download and Use of Mobile or Web Applications
In order to use CONNEXME on a DEVICE, the USER can download the MOBILE APPLICATION and thereby agrees to respect the terms and conditions as defined below.  The MOBILE APPLICATION is available for download via the Apple Store and on Android stores (Google Play, etc.).  Charges applied by the mobile phone operator regarding the download of the MOBILE APPLICATION and its use are the responsibility of the USER.
2.3 Download of the ConnexMe TV Application
In order to manage EVENTS, the ORGANIZER must download the CONNEXME TV APPLICATION available with EVENIUM and agree to respect the terms and conditions defined below, notably in article 6.
2.4 Notifications / Hyperlinks
When a USER participates in an EVENT and connects to secondary sites and/or other applications on their mobile device, notifications signalling an activity concerning the EVENT (publication of content, invitation to take part in a poll, etc.) may appear on the USER'S screen if this function has been activated on the mobile device.
Upon clicking on the hyperlink, USERS may be redirected to secondary sites whose privacy policies may be different to that of Evenium.  It is therefore up to each USER to consult the privacy policies of these sites, as EVENIUM will not be held responsible for information transmitted or collected through visits to secondary sites.
3 ORGANIZATION OF AND PARTICIPATION IN EVENTS
3.1 Organization of Events
3.1.1 Organization of events by the ORGANIZER
The ORGANIZER is able to organize multiple events from one unique account.
The ORGANIZER is solely responsible for the events they organize along with associated risks and profits.
They confirm to EVENIUM that they have respected all legal obligations and rules pertaining to this (obtaining licenses, respecting intellectual property rights, etc.).
The ORGANIZER declares notably that they have:
the right to distribute TICKETS to the EVENT and that this right is not limited by any engagement undertaken towards a third party;
all necessary authorization, notably administrative, required for the organization of the EVENT.  To this end, they agree to respect regulations applicable to the EVENT, notably but not exclusively employment legislation, health and safety requirements, regulations applying to public spaces and regulations pertaining to the sale of alcohol.
The ORGANIZER will be required to provide full proof of identity including title, full name, email address, and if applicable, date and place of birth, postal address, job title and company. If the ORGANIZER is a group or body, this information includes notably the company name, the billing postal address, the email address, the name of an official contact and/or the name of person in charge. This information will be collected by EVENIUM in accordance with the conditions and to the ends outlined in article 4.
If the ORGANIZER represents a group or body, they confirm they are duly authorized to do so, and must be able to make commitments on behalf of this body and represent it, register it on the SITE, organize EVENTS in its name and give EVENIUM a mandate for billing and collection of money as outlined below.
Furthermore, the ORGANIZER declares that the body they represent is
duly registered on the Trade and Companies Register
or its local official equivalent, that it is not in receivership, undergoing liquidation or judicial safeguard procedures and that it is contractually competent.
The ORGANIZER must in all cases inform EVENIUM without delay of any change in name or company name, billing address, legal status, bank details, VAT number or legal situation (receivership, liquidation etc.)  of the body they represent.
The ORGANIZER is informed that, no matter the nature of the changes which may be made, all the invoices for one event will increment the
same sequence
.  If changes to the ORGANIZER are such that they necessitate the resetting of billing information, a new account must be set up in the name of this new individual.
EVENIUM reserves the right to reject any registration application at its discretion without having to justify its decision.
The ORGANIZER will give an honest and truthful representation of  their EVENTS to avoid creating confusion or misunderstanding on the part of the PARTICIPANTS.  Notably, no confusion must be generated regarding Evenium's role as service provider only, whose name must be in no way associated with the organization of any EVENT.
Under no circumstances
will EVENIUM be responsible to check
the veracity of published information.
The ORGANIZER will not organize any prohibited or criminal EVENTS (and notably will not promote illegal products, alcoholic products, armaments, gambling, tobacco, prostitution, etc. - see below).
In line with the requirements of the TICKETING SERVICE, EVENIUM is mandated to distribute and sell TICKETS in the name of the ORGANIZER corresponding to each EVENT and in accordance with the conditions specified below.
3.1.2 Invitations sent by EVENIUM on behalf of the ORGANIZER or registering a person by a PARTICIPANT
EVENIUM can send invitation emails on behalf and in the name of the ORGANIZER or a PARTICIPANT to PARTICIPANTS and to third parties, whose names and email addresses have been provided by the ORGANIZER or PARTICIPANT.
The PARTICIPANT can also buy tickets for third parties. Any PARTICIPANT who registers other people for an EVENT guarantees the ORGANIZER  and EVENIUM that they are authorized to transmit the names and email addresses of the people they are registering for the event.
EVENIUM will remind the recipients of tickets or invitations for which they have been invited at the request of the ORGANIZER or the PARTICIPANT, and that they have the right to access, alter and delete this information.
The ORGANIZER may also transmit to EVENIUM the surnames, first names, photographs, job titles, employing company names, email addresses, etc. of people who are confirmed as PARTICIPANTS in an EVENT and do not need to buy a TICKET by means of the TICKETING SERVICE.  In this case the ORGANIZER guarantees EVENIUM that these people have been informed of their right to access, alter or delete this information, that they have expressly agreed that their surname, first name, job title, employing company and photograph be transmitted to Evenium and appear on the list of PARTICIPANTS and that they may be contacted by other PARTICIPANTS (it being specified that their email address will not be communicated to the latter).  The presence of these PARTICIPANTS at the event will be indicated to the other PARTICIPANTS present at the EVENT.
In any of the cases indicated in the four paragraphs above, EVENIUM will act only as an authorized representative of the ORGANIZER or PARTICIPANT, with no right to use these names and email addresses on their behalf until the people invited or the PARTICIPANTS have accepted the TCUS specified here.
The ORGANIZER or PARTICIPANT who has asked to invite or register someone for an event declares that they hold all necessary rights and authorizations
(notably required by the
French data protection and freedom of information law
"Loi informatique et liberté")
regarding the elements transmitted to EVENIUM within the framework of this article.  The ORGANIZER also guarantees EVENIUM against any action which could be brought against them in this regard, and agrees that EVENIUM will be indemnified from any judgement which may result as well as from any damages to be paid.  The ORGANIZER will reimburse EVENIUM all legal costs, notably legal representation fees, both pre- and during litigation.
3.2 Invoicing Authorization
The ORGANIZER agrees that, for the use of the TICKETING SERVICE, they authorize EVENIUM to
draw up
a full invoice in their name and on their behalf.  Therefore EVENIUM's role is purely that of a transparent intermediary. For EVENTS using the United States Dollar currency, the Canadian Dollar currency, the Brazilian Real currency or the Mexican Peso currency, the ORGANIZER authorizes EVENIUM INCORPORATED to
draw up
a full invoice in their name and on their behalf.
In this case the sale of TICKETS will be completed directly between the PARTICIPANT and the ORGANIZER.  The ORGANIZER is solely responsible for the organization of the EVENT, its implementation, its cancellation and its consequences, as well as the execution of the contract entered into with the PARTICIPANT.
EVENIUM will be in no way considered party to the contract concluded between the PARTICIPANT and the ORGANIZER.
EVENIUM is under no circumstances liable for the improper performance of the contract between the PARTICIPANT and the ORGANIZER, who will indemnify EVENIUM against any claims regarding this.
This mandate solely concerns the invoicing for the sale of TICKETS to the ORGANIZER'S EVENTS.
The ORGANIZER is solely responsible for the respect of regulations applicable to invoicing, for the declaration and payment of VAT to the relevant tax authorities, and for the payment of all other tax and/or levy and/or duty applicable to the EVENT for which they remain personally responsible and accountable.
The VAT rate applicable to each EVENT will be provided by the ORGANIZER through a form in the event management interface.
The ORGANIZER will be able to access a copy of each invoice issued on a page of the SITE specifically for this purpose, and agrees to request this from Evenium if this obligation is not met.
The ORGANIZER will have ten days to contest the content of invoices issued in their name and on their behalf.  This ten day period begins on the day the invoice is issued.
3.3 Payment Collection Authorization
For online payments through STRIPE or Paypal, the ORGANIZER receives the proceeds from the sale of TICKETS directly in his STRIPE or Paypal account.
For online payments using EVENIUM online payment module (i.e. not STRIPE or Paypal), th
e ORGANIZER agrees that, for the use of the TICKETING SERVICE, they authorize EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED to take payment, in their name and on their behalf, of the amounts due for the sales of TICKETS for each EVENT. The ORGANIZER will be able to view the sums collected by EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED in the name of and on the behalf of the ORGANIZER via the event management interface.
ORGANIZER authorizes EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED to deduct directly  from the sales of TICKETS, Evenium fees or any amount due by the ORGANIZER.
As a result of the above, the ORGANIZER expressly authorizes EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED to act in their name and on their behalf regarding the sale of TICKETS, the issuing of the corresponding invoice and the issuing and sending of TICKETS to PARTICIPANTS.
The ORGANIZER agrees to recognize the validity of all TICKETS issued by EVENIUM.
3.4 Pricing/Remuneration
For paid events, the price of TICKETS, including all tax, will be set by the ORGANIZER and must be no less than the amount indicated in Appendix 1 (column “Minimum price of a ticket”).  The TICKETS may be free.
EVENIUM will receive a commission for each TICKET sold corresponding to the scale indicated in Appendix 1.
EVENIUM's remuneration is in no way affected by chargeback requests linked to the rejection of credit cards.  This risk is assumed by the organizer alone, without affecting EVENIUM's remuneration.
EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED, for EVENTS which currency is the United States Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Brazilian Real or the Mexican Peso, reserves the right, at any time, to withhold registration fees collected on behalf of the ORGANIZER if EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED determines that there is an allegation of fraud for the EVENT, or if EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED determines that some refunds or any other amount of money is due or may potentially be due in the future (cancellation, disputed charges, chargebacks, violation of this TCUS, violation of any applicable laws or regulations), or in case of any dispute involving the ORGANIZER.
Any credit card chargebacks from a buyer will be charged back to the ORGANIZER. If a chargeback occurs after EVENIUM has transferred the registration fees (EVENIUM remuneration being deducted) to the ORGANIZER, the ORGANIZER shall indemnify EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED for the chargebacks and related EVENIUM fees mentioned in Appendix 1 (“Charge per chargeback”).
EVENIUM reserves the right to suspend the account of any ORGANIZER in the case of non-payment of the commission due.
When configuring the EVENT, the ORGANIZER must choose a currency for the EVENT among the currencies accepted by EVENIUM. EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED will then collect and transfer funds in the selected currency.
3.5 Reservation
The USER's places at the EVENT are reserved when they click on the 'submit' button on the reservation summary page. EVENIUM's automatic saving systems are considered as proof of the nature, content and date of the agreement. Any reservation confirmed by the USER by clicking on the 'submit' button is final and irrevocable.
3.6 Order confirmation
EVENIUM confirms the USER's acceptance of the reservation via email.  The sale is completed only once the reservation confirmation has been sent by EVENIUM.  The USER is informed and expressly accepts that EVENIUM retains the right not to confirm the order as long as they inform the USER.  In all cases, the sale of the TICKET is concluded on the condition that the price of the TICKET will be paid in full.
3.7 Payment/Reimbursement
For events using EVENIUM online payment module (i.e. not STRIPE or Paypal), the ORGANIZER will receive the proceeds from the sale of TICKETS, in the bank account whose details have been provided, once EVENIUM's remuneration has been deducted, at the latest 10 working days after the end date of the EVENT provided that no payment has been made after the end date of the event.
Should any payment be made
after the end date of the event, the deadline will be extended to 10 working days after this transaction.​
Any payment by EVENIUM of the registration proceeds made before 10 working days after the EVENT, shall be considered as an advance. EVENIUM may, at any time, demand back such an advance, which then must be paid by the ORGANIZER without any delay.
To be admissible, all challenges must be addressed from the ORGANIZER to EVENIUM and sent by registered mail with proof of receipt within fifteen days of payment.
The ORGANIZER agrees to inform EVENIUM of the cancellation of an event.
In this case, the ORGANIZER agrees to refund the TICKET price to the PARTICIPANTS and expressly authorizes EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED to do so within fifteen days of the date the event was to have taken place if the ORGANIZER has not already refunded the PARTICIPANTS (see (
v.
) below).
EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED is only required to reimburse PARTICIPANTS up to the sum of money it possesses on behalf of the ORGANIZER for the EVENT in question, once the fees due to EVENIUM for its remuneration have been deducted.
(i) If the funds retained by EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED on behalf of an ORGANIZER after the deduction of fees are sufficient to reimburse all PARTICIPANTS in an EVENT, the PARTICIPANTS will be automatically refunded the price of the TICKET, subject to and within the limits of any agreements entered into between the ORGANIZER and the PARTICIPANTS.
(ii) If the funds retained by EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED on behalf of an ORGANIZER after the deduction of fees owed are not sufficient to reimburse all PARTICIPANTS in an EVENT, the ORGANIZER must provide EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED with the necessary amount within five days of the cancellation of the event.  As soon as this money has been received, EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED will reimburse the PARTICIPANT in accordance with the terms outlined  above (i).
(iii) If the money is not received within this time period, EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED is authorized by the ORGANIZER to reimburse the PARTICIPANTS who request this, up to the amount of funds EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED holds on behalf of the ORGANIZER after the deduction of fees owed for EVENIUM's remuneration, in the order of  requests for reimbursement within 6 months of the date when the EVENT should have taken place.
(iv) Beyond this 6 months period, EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED is expressly authorized by the PARTICIPANTS to transfer to the ORGANIZER the remainder of the funds held on their behalf, after the deduction of fees owed for EVENIUM's remuneration. The reimbursement of the price of the TICKET will be the concern of the PARTICIPANT and the ORGANIZER, with no support or intervention from EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED, who will have no further responsibility in this regard.
(v) In all cases, the reimbursement of a PARTICIPANT's TICKET may be handled by the ORGANIZER themselves, who has access to a page specifically for this via the administrative interface. In accordance with any agreement between the ORGANIZER and the PARTICIPANTS, the reimbursement of the TICKET may be total or partial. EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED is now authorized to reimburse a PARTICIPANT from the funds it holds on behalf of the ORGANIZER for the EVENT in question after the deduction of fees owed for EVENIUM's remuneration. If this isn't the case, the ORGANIZER must transfer to EVENIUM or EVENIUM INCORPORATED the necessary funds for this reimbursement.
3.8 Tickets
TICKETS may be neither returned nor exchanged. TICKETS are personal and non-transferable, even for a price lower than the sale price.
A TICKET permits one single PARTICIPANT to
enter
an EVENT. In the case of duplicated tickets, only the first TICKET to be presented will be valid. If necessary the ORGANIZER may decide to check the identity of PARTICIPANTS on entry to the EVENT and may request presentation of any form of identification (ID card, passport, driving licence, etc.).
The TICKETS are printed or shown electronically by the PARTICIPANT
, and must be completely legible, otherwise entry to the event may be refused without compensation.
Although the sale is made remotely, there is no withdrawal period in favour of the PARTICIPANT, as the sale concerns an entertainment service provided on a specific date.
The ORGANIZER reserves the right to alter the non-essential characteristics of the EVENT as long as they inform the PARTICIPANTS of this.
3.9 Terms and Conditions of the Organizer
The ORGANIZER is free to specify the general conditions which will apply to the contractual relationship between them and the PARTICIPANT.  These general conditions will complement those presented here.  In case of conflict the TCUS presented here prevail.
The PARTICIPANT formally accepts these general conditions by ticking the box "I accept the terms and conditions of the organizer" on the event registration form.
3.10 Sharing of Information with other users: Public or Private nature of the event
If the ORGANIZER has defined an EVENT as private, the PERSONAL DATA of the USER (except for their email address) and the CONTENT they put online will be shared with the other PARTICIPANTS in the same EVENT, including the ORGANIZERS, within the conditions specified by these TCUS and subject to the restrictions determined by the USER via their PROFILE, which the USER expressly and unreservedly accepts.
When the ORGANIZER has defined the event as public the PERSONAL DATA of the USER (except for their email address) and the CONTENT they have published will be freely accessible to the public in accordance with the conditions laid out in these TCUS and subject to any restrictions determined by the USER via their PROFILE, which the USER expressly and unreservedly accepts.
In all cases the USER accepts that their PERSONAL DATA (except for their email address) and CONTENT will be visible throughout EVENTS on all media including CONNEXME APPLICATIONS, but also displayed on broadcast screens at the event, and that all PARTICIPANTS at the EVENT may freely consult the list of other PARTICIPANTS at the same EVENT and contact them (it is specified that each PARTICIPANT's email address will not be visible to the others).
3.11 Presence at an event
When a PARTICIPANT indicates he/she will be present at an EVENT by registering to the ORGANIZER on the EVENT website or by a PARTICIPANT declaration (check-in) by activating this function on the CONNEXME APPLICATION. In this case, it is requested that the PARTICIPANT only declares him or herself present once he/she is actually at the EVENT. EVENIUM reserves the right to change the status of all PARTICIPANTS who claim they are there but actually aren’t.
4 PERSONAL DATA
4.1 Information collected by Evenium
The USER is informed and accepts that EVENIUM collects and retains the information they communicate when they create their PROFILE, when they organize or participate in an EVENT, when they use EVENIUM SERVICES or on the BILLING FORM.
The USER must be an adult with full legal capacity, except in educational situations as specified in section 1.F.
This information is intended to enrich the USER's PROFILE, to personalize the EVENIUM SERVICES offered to them and to allow the PARTICIPANT to participate in events they want to and if necessary to receive invoices related to an EVENT.
This information also allows a USER's activity on EVENIUM to be monitored (participation in and/or organization of EVENTS). It also allows each USER to access their PROFILE, their invoices if they are an ORGANIZER and their entry tickets if they are a PARTICIPANT, to search through or consult the list of past EVENTS in which they have participated or to search for future EVENTS according to their areas of interest.  This information also allows other USERS to contact them via EVENIUM (without their email address being given)  during EVENTS in which they are participating together.
EVENIUM will only be able to use this PERSONAL DATA (and notably the postal or email address) if related to the EVENIUM SERVICES. EVENIUM will never:
use this PERSONAL DATA for any sales contact,

The ORGANIZER should make best efforts not to collect any personal data concerning minors, and instead request email addresses or personal communication identifiers of their parents or guardians instead.
The ORGANIZER guarantees EVENIUM against any action which could be brought against them due to the data collected on the CUSTOMIZABLE FORM, and agrees that EVENIUM will be indemnified from any judgement which may result as well as from any damages to be paid.  The ORGANIZER will reimburse EVENIUM all legal costs, notably legal representation fees, both pre- and during litigation.
The ORGANIZER guarantees EVENIUM that the personal information collected is dealt with and stored in accordance with the laws and regulations of France, with the laws and regulations of the country of the ORGANIZER,

The ORGANIZER also declares that this collection has been subjected to all the necessary declarations relating to legal entities (CNIL etc). If the ORGANIZER isn’t based in France, they guarantee EVENIUM that they offer a level of protection equal to that of French legislation.
The ORGANIZER also guarantees that they will respect the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable, including the GDPR, especially in terms of allowing PARTICIPANTS to exercise their rights (access, amendments, deletion etc).
The PARTICIPANT is informed that s/he should exercise his/her rights for this sort of information directly with the ORGANIZER.

6 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The USER guarantees they are the owner of all copyrights and/or rights related to the CONTENT they publish and/or to other elements they may potentially provide, publish or share in relation to EVENTS or the use of EVENIUM SERVICES.
If applicable, the USER declares to have obtained the legal transfer of all intellectual property rights to the CONTENT they publish, and guarantees EVENIUM free and unchallenged utilization of said CONTENT.  Notably, the ORGANIZER agrees to obtain from presenters using the CONNEXME TV application at their EVENTS
an
agreement for transfer of copyright.
In the case where the USER holds copyrights or intellectual property rights over the CONTENT they publish, they expressly accept that their publication implies transfer to EVENIUM of the usage rights outlined below on a non-exclusive and non-paying basis, worldwide and for as long as the PROFILE exists (in accordance with the provisions referred to in article 10 below), for the purpose of providing EVENIUM SERVICES on behalf of said USER.
The choice of the ORGANIZER regarding the private or public nature of the EVENT will determine whether the CONTENT broadcast in relation to this EVENT will be accessible to the public or only to PARTICIPANTS in the EVENT. When the ORGANIZER indicates that the EVENT is private in nature, the CONTENT published in relation to it by a USER will only be distributed to other PARTICIPANTS in the EVENT and to the ORGANIZER. However, when the ORGANIZER indicates that it is a public EVENT, the CONTENT published in relation to it by the USER will be accessible to the public.
By using the Services, the USER is giving EVENIUM consent to store recordings of their audio or video CONTENT.
The USER is responsible for compliance with all audio or video recordings laws. The ORGANIZER guarantees that he has informed all the participants of the EVENT that they will be recorded. The USER will receive, once per EVENT, a notification (visual or otherwise) before their first audio or video recording. If the USER does not consent to be recorded, they can choose to leave the EVENT.
EVENIUM disclaims all liability for the audio or video CONTENT and recording issued from the USER. The USER agrees to hold EVENIUM harmless from damages or liabilities related to the recording of any audio or video data.
In all cases the rights transferred to EVENIUM over the published CONTENT comprise notably:
6.1 Reproduction rights
The right to save the CONTENT or have it saved through any technical process, whether known or to date unknown (notably phonographic, sound and video processes in film, analogue or digital form) on any medium, in all definitions, formats and framing ratios, using black and white or color images and in various dimensions
The right to produce, or have produced, an unlimited number of copies of original CONTENT, on any medium, notably paper, film reel, soundtrack and all other formats known or to date unknown
The right to digitize CONTENT, to store it on any medium, to modulate, compress or decompress it or to use any other technical process of this nature for storage, transfer and/or usage reasons
6.2 Representation rights
The USER expressly and unreservedly authorizes EVENIUM to represent, distribute and communicate CONTENT (or have this carried out) without charge to the public (when the EVENT is public) or to the PARTICIPANTS in the EVENT and to the ORGANIZER (when it is private), through broadcasting in all languages and an unlimited number of broadcasts, in its entirety or in extract, in original, dubbed or subtitled form in all languages, on any medium and using any process whether known or to date unknown, notably but not exclusively:
internet use (reproduction, download, free or charged streaming, fixed or mobile, etc.) notably of  the WEB APPLICATION;
broadcast on any video screen, projector or broadcast terminal (computers, tablets) during EVENTS
use on all mobile telephone devices (3G, 4G, iPhone, Blackberry etc.) notably via the MOBILE APPLICATION;

use on video media (VHS, DVD, DVD-HD, Blu-Ray, UMD, CD-Rom, DVD-Rom, minidisc etc.);
televisual broadcast, digital and/or analogue,  through all processes inherent in televisual broadcast and any method of image and/or sound processing which may be used in conjunction or separately, whether known or to this date unknown, notably through digital or analogue terrestrial broadcast,  cable, ADSL, including all telephone networks via XDSL technology (for example mobile television such as DVB-H or T-DBM), satellite and any electronic communication network similar to the aforementioned;
use on interactive television channels, notably video on demand (VOD, SVOD, Pay per view).
6.3 Adaptation rights
The USER expressly grants EVENIUM the right to adapt and split CONTENT by adding sub-titles, explanations, captions, dubbing, translations and sound recordings, by superimposing other CONTENT from other PARTICIPANTS and music, and by incorporating any other new elements, logos or text.
The USER expressly and unreservedly authorizes EVENIUM to produce or have produced, all translations, dubbings and sub-titles in all languages, of CONTENT in its entirety or extracts, for no charge.  This CONTENT may also be cropped, edited (notably for broadcasting extracts) or subjected to all other technical or graphic modifications.
More specifically, the ORGANIZER and PARTICIPANTS expressly authorize EVENIUM, for as long as their PROFILE exists, to produce overviews of the EVENT in which they have participated and to compile documents, photographs and films shown during the EVENT, and PARTICIPANTS' comments and images of speakers in a unique file.  This overview will be distributed only to PARTICIPANTS in the EVENT when the ORGANIZER has indicated that it is private, or will be freely accessible to the public when the ORGANIZER has indicated that it is public.
In the hypothetical situation where the USER holds copyrights over the CONTENT or PERSONAL DATA which is published, they expressly grant EVENIUM a free and non-exclusive licence for all zones in which the copyright is protected and for the duration of the protection of the copyright (before renewal, etc.)
The USER likewise declares to have accepted that, when the EVENT is public, the PARTICIPANTS and the ORGANIZER of this EVENT have the ability to share and broadcast, for free and to non-commercial ends, some or all of the CONTENT the USER has published on EVENIUM SERVICES or other secondary internet services such as social or professional networks (eg Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn).  All other use is subject to authorization by the USER who published the CONTENT.  In no case will EVENIUM be held responsible for the sharing or broadcast of this CONTENT, which is entirely at the USER's initiative and their sole responsibility.
The USER promises, finally and definitely, not to seek reimbursement of any kind from EVENIUM or its beneficiaries in relation to the exertion of these intellectual property rights under the conditions laid out in these TCUS.
If the USER notices any illegal content or an abuse or violation of third party rights, they can notify EVENIUM by sending an email to the address
account-data-update@evenium.com
.  Any reports knowingly based on false information give rise to liability on the part of the USER.
6.4 Processing of CONTENT Rights
EVENIUM shall have the right to use the CONTENT, including audio or video recordings, in an anonymous way, in order to improve the quality of EVENIUM SERVICES. For example, EVENIUM will process the CONTENT to test, tune, optimize, validate, train internal EVENIUM algorithms, used to deliver the EVENIUM SERVICES.
7 IMAGE RIGHTS – PERSONALITY RIGHTS
The USER guarantees to have obtained prior permission of the people whose PERSONALITY RIGHTS are concerned when their image is shown in photographs and/or images published on EVENIUM SERVICES.
The USER expressly and definitively accepts that their PERSONALITY RIGHTS, notably their name, photograph and voice, including all images and elements of PERSONAL DATA they provide on their profile (or on social network profiles if content has been aggregated) or whilst participating in EVENTS, may be published on EVENIUM SERVICES and recorded either together or separately, stored and reproduced by any process and on any media, whether known or to date unknown.
The USER also guarantees EVENIUM free and unchallenged use of said images and/or CONTENT.
The USER expressly and irrevocably authorizes EVENIUM to store, reproduce and use their image at no cost to EVENIUM.
This implies that any photographic, videographic or cinematographic recording taken during the EVENT may be freely used by EVENIUM, without the need to request the USER'S authorization in advance nor the need to provide any remuneration or compensation.
This authorization is granted to EVENIUM under the same terms, conditions and limits as those specified for copyrights (see above), notably concerning the audience to which these images may be distributed, which varies according to the public or private NATURE of the EVENT, as defined by the ORGANIZER.
Furthermore, the USER recognizes that they have been fully informed and accept that these elements may be subject to various adaptations, notably cuts, edits (especially for the broadcast of extracts), photographic retouching (by any method and notably through photographic retouching software), subtitling, dubbing etc..
The USER also declares their knowledge that photographs taken during EVENTS and/or photographs they provide may be used in accordance with the conditions defined above.
The USER is informed that the content may be projected onto screens or broadcast on the internet and therefore visible to third parties who are participating in the EVENT but are not USERS of EVENIUM SERVICES.
The USER promises, finally and definitely, not to seek reimbursement of any kind from EVENIUM or its beneficiaries in relation to the use of their photograph under the conditions laid out in these TCUS.
