Cookies and similar technologies
How do we use Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that contain a unique identifier that is stored on your computer or mobile device so that the device you are using can be recognized when you visit a particular website or use an application. Cookies may be used for the duration of your visit to a particular site or to measure how you use the service and content from time to time. Cookies help us to display important features and functions used on our Websites and mobile Applications, and to improve your customer experience.
What Cookies do we use?
Cookies can be distinguished by several criteria. Depending on who creates and processes a particular Cookie, we can divide these text files into two categories:
The so-called first-party cookies are created directly by websites or scripts located on the same domain address. Most often they are used to provide the basic functions of the website.
Third-party cookies are created by other websites. These sites have certain content on the website you visit, such as ads, images, or videos.
Cookies can also be divided according to their lifetime:
Session cookies.
Session cookies are temporary and are only stored on your device until you stop browsing on your Internet browser and are deleted after you close them. These cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the website or related applications.
Persistent cookies.
We may use persistent cookies to make our website easier and more convenient to navigate (for example, for easier and faster navigation). These cookies remain in your browser for a longer period of time or until you delete them manually. The length of this period depends on the selected settings of your Internet browser. Persistent cookies allow information to be transmitted to an Internet server every time you visit a website.
According to the purpose of use, cookies can be divided into:
Necessary cookies (cookies that provide basic functionality and are necessary for the operation of the website).
These include, for example, cookies that allow you to log in to secure areas of our website. These cookies do not collect information about users that can be used for marketing purposes or to remember what pages users have visited on the Internet.
Performance cookies.
We use performance cookies to improve the functionality of the website. These cookies collect information about how visitors use the website, such as which pages visitors visit most often and whether they receive error messages from the website. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, which allows us to track how visitors use the website. These cookies do not collect information that would allow the user to be personally identified. The information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous.
Functional cookies
. Functional cookies facilitate the operation of the website and improve the functions of the website. They are used to activate certain features of the website (e.g. video playback) and to adjust them according to your choices (e.g. language) in order to improve your experience on the website. In the same way, we use functional cookies to save your settings about the website, which may be useful the next time you visit the website. Functional cookies do not collect information that can identify you.
Targeted advertising (profiling) cookies.
The targeting cookie is used to track your preferences when you are using the website and to send you personalized advertising messages based on your preferences.
Your choices about Cookies
Web browser cookies
In your browser settings, you can accept or reject new cookies and delete existing cookies. You can also set your browser to notify you every time new cookies are placed on your computer or other device. You can find more information about managing cookies in the 'help' function of your browser.
If you turn off certain cookies, you will not be able to use all the features of our Websites. For example, in certain cases, you won’t be able to add products to your cart, log out, or use products and services that require you to log in.
You can also change your settings for advertising-related cookies used through the Service Providers listed in the table below or by visiting the
“YourOnlineChoices
” website. When we place personalized advertisements that link to other organizations' websites, the
AdChoices
icon is usually displayed. If you click on this icon, you will find a special leaflet on how to manage your online advertising preferences. For more information, visit
youradchoices
.
Mobile applications
Cookies work differently in mobile applications because they are embedded in the applications, using a unique identifier generated by your mobile device to render advertising activities. You can turn off or reset this advertising ID in the privacy settings of your mobile device.
