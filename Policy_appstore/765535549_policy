US Privacy Notice Addendum
Last updated:
Dec

,
2024
Natural Cycles provides this US Privacy Notice Addendum (the “US Addendum”) to US residents acting as “consumers” under applicable state privacy laws (“consumers” or “you”), such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, Colorado Privacy Act, and similar laws in other states. This US Addendum supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this US Addendum has the meaning given in our Privacy Policy.
This US Addendum does not apply to information we collect about individuals in their capacity as present or former job applicants, employees, contractors, owners, directors, or officers of Natural Cycles.
As used in this US Addendum, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household.  “Sensitive Personal Information” refers to certain types of Personal Information that are subject to heightened protections by law, such as health data.
1.  Consumer requests
Depending on the privacy laws that apply in your state of residence, you may make the following types of requests. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
(a)    Request to Know: to confirm whether we process your Personal Information and to request a copy of such Personal Information;
(b)    Request to Correct: to request correction if there are inaccuracies in your Personal Information;
(c)    Request to Delete: to request deletion of your Personal Information, subject to potential exceptions under applicable law;
(d)    Opt-out of Sale and Targeted Advertising: to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information and processing of your Personal Information for targeted advertising.
Please note that we do not sell Personal Information in the traditional sense of the word, for monetary consideration. However, because the definitions of “Sale” and “Share” under certain US privacy laws are broad enough to potentially include the disclosure of your information to certain types of advertising partners, you may have the right to opt out of such “Sale” and “Sharing.” For example, we may disclose to our advertising partners identifiers and metadata (such as commercial information concerning interest in Natural Cycles, geolocation data, and internet or other similar network activity) for targeted advertising, which may be a Sale or Sharing under these laws. For clarity, we do not Sell or Share any fertility status data, period data, sexual activity
data, medical condition data, or logged symptom or pregnancy data. Certain US privacy laws also require us to provide the following notice language:
NOTICE: We may sell your sensitive personal data.
Further, please note that we do not knowingly Sell or Share the Personal Information of anyone under 16 years old.
2.  How to submit requests
Requests may be submitted by yourself or an authorized agent by emailing us at
support@naturalcycles.com
or using the
request web form
. We will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law, taking into account the type and sensitivity of the Personal Information subject to the request. We may need to request additional Personal Information from you, such as [email address, state of residency, or mailing address], to verify your identity and protect against fraudulent requests. If you maintain a password-protected account with us, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account and require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or deleting your Personal Information. If you make a Request to Delete, we may ask you to confirm your request before we delete your Personal Information.
Depending on your state of residence, if we decline to take action on a request, you may submit an appeal by
https://www.naturalcycles.com/submitrequest
.
We will not unlawfully discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under applicable US state consumer data privacy laws.

This
US Consumer Health Data Notice applies to US residents whose Consumer Health Data is processed by Natural Cycles (“you”) under US state consumer health privacy laws, including the Washington My Health My Data Act (the “Washington Act”). This US Consumer Health Data Notice supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy
.
“Consumer Health Data” means personal information that is linked or reasonably linked to an individual and that identifies past, present or future physical or mental health status.
1.  Categories of Consumer Health Data that we collect and the use and purposes of collection
Natural Cycles collects, uses, and discloses Consumer Health Data as needed to provide you with the products or Services that you request, with your consent, or as permitted by applicable law.
Natural Cycles collects and uses the following categories of Consumer Health Data:
information on your fertility status and planning, such as whether you are using our App and Services to prevent, plan, or follow a pregnancy;
information related to fertility, such as your contraceptives history, body temperature, menstruation and intercourse data, ovulation, pregnancy test results and associated personal notes.
2.  Sources of Consumer Health Data
We collect Consumer Health Data directly from you or from devices on which our products or Services are installed.
3.  Disclosures of Consumer Health Data
We may disclose the categories of Consumer Health Data described above to third parties for our operational business and legal compliance purposes, as described in Section 6 of our Privacy Policy, as follows: service providers; affiliates; successors if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or reorganization; with your consent; as required by applicable law; or to protect and defend the rights and interests of Natural Cycles, our users, or others. The specific affiliates to whom we disclose Consumer Health Data are the Natural Cycles group companies: NaturalCycles AG (Holding), NaturalCycles Nordic AB, NaturalCycles USA Corporation, related by common ownership or control, for purposes of carrying out the processing of Consumer Health Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Please note, we do not sell Consumer Health Data in the traditional sense of the word, for monetary consideration. However, because the definition of “Sale” under the Washington Act is broad enough to potentially include the disclosure of your information to certain types of advertising partners, you may have the right to opt-out of such Sale. Consumer Health Data that may be Sold are identifiers and metadata (such as commercial information concerning your interest in Natural Cycles, geolocation data, as well as internet or other similar network activity).

your information.
You may request that we delete your Consumer Health Data.
If we are processing your Consumer Health Data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent.
You may submit requests to

Introduction
We know that you care how information about you is processed. This Privacy Policy outlines in detail how we collect, process, use and transfer (collectively “process”) your personal data when you apply for a position with us. Considering the volume of information that is provided to you, please refer to the content section above to identify the areas you are most interested in. The service for handling recruitments and simplifying the hiring process (the “Service”) is powered by Teamtailor on behalf of Natural Cycles (“Controller” “we” “us” etc.).
Personal data is information that relates to an individual who can be identified from that information, whether or not in conjunction with any other information. Common examples of personal data processed by us in our day to day business include names, addresses, telephone numbers and other contact details, payroll data, attendance data, performance management data, and CCTV images.
In our capacity of a data controller (meaning that we determine how and why your personal data is processed) we are responsible for the processing of personal data of you as an applicant (referred to as “you/r” unless the context provides for a different interpretation) carried out in connection with your application to work with us.
Our processing of your personal data is always performed in compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as this Privacy Policy.
By sending us your application , you agree to the processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you read this Privacy Policy carefully and understand it in its entirety.
Processing your personal data
How and why do we process your personal data?
Our routines for processing personal data have been construed with the purpose of minimizing the amount of personal data being processed at any time.
The personal data we collect from you or through our systems help us managing your application, but also to comply with our legal obligations or for the conduct of our business. The personal data we collect, the basis of processing and the purposes of processing are detailed below. Sometimes, these activities are carried out by third parties, including other members of our group of companies.
Personal data
Personnel administration data; name, photo, private contact details, gender, marital status, date of birth, data on education, professional experiences and qualifications, social security ID, certificates and diplomas, correspondence, union membership (when required by law only)
Basis of processing
It is necessary for the handling your application, to take steps for entering into a contract with you or to achieve our legitimate interests.
Purpose of Processing
This is required to enable us to administer your application, the set-up of an electronic personnel file. It is voluntarily for you to provide us with a photo of yourself. We will also use your contact details to request feedback. Participation in feedback surveys or similar is voluntary.
Where do we obtain your personal data from?
Most of the personal data we process is obtained from you when you apply to join us, but we also obtain personal data about you in employment applications and vetting, performance appraisals or general correspondence, or by using a third-party source such as Facebook or LinkedIn. For other data types, we may obtain it as a result of you being on our premises or using our systems (for example, CCTV footage or IT usage information).
In some circumstances, we may request your explicit consent to process (specific types of) personal data. In these circumstances, you can withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions provided when you gave consent or at the contact details under Questions and queries below.
Will my personal data be shared with others or transferred to countries outside the EEA?
We will only share your personal data in certain circumstances and where lawful to do so. We may share your personal data with the following third parties and for the following purposes.
Group companies,
For the purposes of handling your application, complying with legal obligations, otherwise administrate the relationship and providing the group with information. Access rights between members of our company group are limited and granted only on a need to know basis, depending on job functions and roles. In addition, your business contact details, photograph, and other information that you make available on our group joint systems may be available across our company group.
Service providers,
We may use third party service providers who provide services such as hosting or “Software as a Service”. In providing the services, your personal data will, where applicable, be processed by the service provider on our behalf. We will check any third party that we use to ensure that they can provide sufficient guarantees regarding the confidentiality and security of your data. We will have written contracts with them which provide assurances regarding the protections that they will give to your data and their compliance with our data security standards and international transfer restrictions. Your personal data may be processed by third party service providers for us to fulfil our obligations towards you or our legal obligations.
Third parties,
Including administrative authorities (tax or social security authorities), financial institutions, insurances, police and public prosecutors as well as external advisors. For the purposes of handling your application, complying with legal obligations and otherwise to administrate our relationship.
Buyers and potential buyers when divesting parts of Natural Cycles.
For the purposes of complying with legal obligations by providing such buyers with accurate and complete information on Natural Cycles.
We may also transfer your personal data we process to a country outside the European Economic Area (”EEA”), for example, when one of our service providers use staff or equipment based outside the EEA or when one of our group companies is based outside of the EEA. We have put in place adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights, e.g. we establish an adequate level of data protection through EU Standard Contractual Clauses based on the EU commission’s model clauses. If you would like to see a copy of any relevant provisions, please contact us as set out in Questions and queries below.
How is my personal data secured?
We operate state of IT security systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal data. We have in particular taken appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data. Access is only granted on a need-to-know basis to those people whose roles require them to process your personal data.
How long will we store your personal data?
Your personal data will only be stored for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected (see above) and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. This may mean that some information is held for longer than other information. After 12 months an email will automatically be sent to the candidate informing that their personal information will be retained unless they actively opt-out.
What are my rights under applicable data protection laws?
You have various rights which you can enforce, including the right to be informed in accordance with this Information. Please find below descriptions of your rights.
Right of access
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your Personal data which we hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”).
Requests for such information should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other staff.
Right of data portability
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used machine readable format.
Requests should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to receive to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations.
The GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records). It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Hence, it does, as a rule, not apply to personal data that was created by Natural Cycles.
Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data
You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate.
We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as they occur, including changes to your contact details, telephone number, immigration status. Please always check first whether self-help tools are available. If no such tools are available, requests should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com.
This right only applies to your own personal data. When exercising this right, please be as specific as possible.
Right to object to or restrict our data processing
Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to object to or ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data.
Requests should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com.
This right applies only if the processing of your personal data is explicitly based on our so-called “legitimate interests” (see “basis of processing” above). Objections must be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. They must not be generic so that we can demonstrate that there are still lawful grounds for us to process your personal data.
Right to have personal data erased
Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled, on certain grounds, to have your personal data erased (also known as the “right to be forgotten”), e.g. where you think that the information we are processing is inaccurate, or the processing is unlawful
Requests should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com.
There are various lawful reasons why we may not be in a position to erase your personal data. This may apply (i) where we have to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) in case of exercising or defending legal claims, or (iii) where retention periods apply by law or our statutes
Right to withdrawal
You have the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.
Requests should be made in writing to dpo@naturalcycles.com
If you withdraw your consent, this will only take effect for the future
Questions and queries
If you have any questions or queries in relation to this Privacy Policy or otherwise regarding data protection, please contact the Recruiting department or the data protection officer by sending an email to dpo@naturalcycles.com.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may decide to change this Privacy Policy. If the change is indicative of a fundamental change to the nature of the processing (e.g. enlargement of the categories of recipients or introduction of transfers to a third country) or a change which may not be fundamental in terms of the processing operation, but which may be relevant to and impact upon you, then the updated Privacy Policy will be provided to you well in advance of the change actually taking effect. We will post the changes online or send them to you via e-mail so that you will be aware of the changes. When notifying you of such changes, we will also explain what the likely impact of those changes on you will be, if any.
Let’s recruit together and find your next colleague.

Our approach to data protection
The types of data we collect and what we use it for
Sharing data externally
How long we keep your data
The security of your data
At Natural Cycles, we are passionate about empowering you through knowledge. That’s why we’re committed to making our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use as clear and transparent as possible: we want you to understand exactly what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we use it for. We also want you to know exactly what you’re signing up for when you use Natural Cycles.
On this page, we will give you an overview of our Privacy Policy. If you would like to register an account with us, please ensure you read this full text, along with our Terms of Use, so that you have all the details. If you have any questions at all after reading them, please get in touch with us via our support portal. We’re here to help.
Our approach to data protection
Data protection is one of our core quality principles at Natural Cycles. We care deeply about the confidentiality and integrity of the information that is shared with us, and we are committed to achieving the highest standards of privacy and security.
At Natural Cycles, we are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and, as we are based in Europe, these rights will apply to you regardless of where you live. Click
here
for more information about your privacy rights.
The types of data we collect and what we use it for
When you use the Natural Cycles app, we collect different types of data. All the data that you provide to us is summarised under the term Personal Data.
This includes information such as your name, email address, location and date of birth. This enables us to administer your account – for example, to set up your individual user profile.
We also collect information such as the temperature measurements you input each day and information you provide about the days you have had unprotected sex. This is a special category of Personal Data, which needs special protection and is categorised as Sensitive Data.
In order for us to store and process this information, we must have your explicit consent. We need Sensitive Data to provide you with the service you signed up for – i.e. to help you prevent, plan or follow a pregnancy. We also use this data as a company to help us improve our service, and to refine the algorithm that powers the app.
Another way that we use this data is to help us monitor the effectiveness of our product as a method of contraception. To do this, we combine the applicable Sensitive Data from all our users into one large “data pool” and review it on a monthly basis to check that our effectiveness rate remains constant; this is a requirement of the notified body that granted our certification.
We use your contact data to send you newsletters, offers and for improving social media marketing. You always have the option to opt-out of this
.
Please see section 3 and 4 in our
privacy policy
for more information about the data we collect and how we use this data.
We also collect data in the form of cookies when you visit our website, to help optimise your browsing experience and to improve our marketing campaigns. Please refer to our
cookie policy
to find out more about how we use cookies.
Sharing data externally
Firstly, we want you to know that we never sell data of any kind.
Furthermore, we do not share any Sensitive Data that can be linked back to you as an individual with any partner for them to use. We do, however, use external suppliers for storing and processing data, with agreements in place to ensure they don’t use the data for other purposes.
If you have consented to us using your data for research in the field of women’s health, we may share fully anonymized sensitive data with external partners such as universities to help us conduct scientific research. You can read more about how we use anonymised data in section 4.3 of our
privacy policy
.
We may sometimes need to share your Personal Data with third parties; for example, when you purchase something from our webshop or to improve social media marketing. For more information about how this works, please see section 6 in our
privacy policy
.
How long we keep your data
We keep your Personal Data for as long as necessary to e.g. comply with legal obligations (e.g. accounting). If you terminate your account with us, we will keep your Account recoverable for an additional 3 years. The reason is to give you the possibility to come back at a different stage in your life and obtain your previous data. You always have the right to request your
account
to be deleted earlier. For more information please see section 5 in our
privacy policy
.
The security of your data
We know that the information you give to us is confidential and we take our responsibility in managing that information very seriously, taking every precaution and complying with advanced industry standards to protect its security. Go to section 7 in our
privacy policy
to learn more about data security at Natural Cycles.
Disclaimer:
Please note that this summary is intended to provide a high-level overview of the key points within our privacy policy and is not legally binding. Only the detailed numbered sections within the full privacy policy are legally binding.
