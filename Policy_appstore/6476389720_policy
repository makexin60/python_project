Is there a legal and contractual obligation to process personal data?
There are several legal regulations that oblige us to collect and process certain personal data about you. This is in particular the obligation the prevent, control, evaluate and detect money laundering, processing of accounting and tax information and fulfilling the purpose of security of personal data and IT systems.
If the collection of personal data relates to a contractual relationship it is often a contractual requirement or a requirement that is necessary for the conclusion of a contract. Failure to provide personal data (whether yours or your colleagues') may result in failure to conclude or performance of a contractual relationship with the company you represent.
When the legal ground for processing your personal data on individual purpose is consent, the provision of your personal data is strictly voluntary and failure to provide it will not have any negative effect or consequences on you.
Who are recipients of your personal data?
We take the confidentiality of your personal data very seriously and have internal policies in place to ensure that your data is only shared with authorised personnel at EUROWAG or a verified third party.
Our staff might have access to your personal data on a strictly need-to-know basis typically governed and limited by function, role and department. We also ensure that selection of our sub-contractors and any processing of personal data by them is compliant with the GDPR or other national law.
Necessary personal data of our clients, business partners or other natural persons are provided to the following categories of recipients:
other companies belonging to EUROWAG based on the joint controllers agreement;
our verified and properly mandated processors;
our professional advisors (e.g. attorneys or auditors);
payroll and accounting companies;
providers of standard software, cloud and Telco services;

In case that you have a question about our current processors, do not hesitate to contact our DPO for further information.
What third-countries do we transfer your personal data to?
By default, we do not transfer personal data to third countries outside the European Economic Area (EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) unless it is necessary. For example, when we provide services for our customers we can use our establishments and business partners from Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Russia, Ukraine, North Macedonia or Serbia. We can also use various cloud services and social network services provided by multiple providers from the USA.
Although we have never noted any problem with the misuse of any personal data in these countries, according to the European Commission’s decisions, these countries are considered not to guarantee an adequate level of protection (of personal data) and therefore we have to proceed on the basis of the adequate safeguards under Article 46 GDPR or on the basis of the exceptions for specific situations under Article 49 GDPR. That is why we conclude Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission with data importers in a third country.
In light of the judgment Court of Justice of the EU in the Schrems II case of 16 July 2020, we also apply
additional safeguards
in relation to transfers to the USA, if we cannot rely on new Data Privacy Framework importer certification. In case the importer is certified, we may transfer your personal data, based on EU-US Commission’s adequacy decision in compliance with Article 45 GDPR requirements, without adopting any other measures.
Are you subject to any automated individual decision-making?
In some cases, yes. We have identified certain processing operations that likely falls under “automated individual-decision making including profiling” within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR, which are described below:
*
We have also identified certain processing operations that are less likely to fall under the Article 22 GDPR, but we inform about these cases anyway.
Description of automated processing

Significance and anticipated consequences for the data subject

Customer, respectively customer’s driver may be affected with non-functioning of fuelling cards provided in post-paid regime and then will not be able to pay for fuelling vehicle with EUROWAG fuelling card.
Credit risk evaluation* –
we use ACAS software to create customer’s maximal credit framework for multiple services in post-paid services, but each customer request which should be rejected based on ACAS decision is systematically and individually reviewed by human credit risk specialist.
Customer request for a line of credit for fuelling services should be before rejection individually re-assessed and confirmed or cancelled by human credit risk specialist. No negative consequences on data subjects are estimated.
