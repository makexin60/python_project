our regulators, law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our legal advisers, courts, applicable independent adjudication services, sports' governing bodies and betting integrity organisations and any other authorised bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity, maintaining standards of behaviour in sport or other regulatory or legal matters.

party organisations however unless you have expressly opted-in/consented to the disclosure of your personal data for these purposes.
We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:

in the event of any insolvency situation (e.g. the administration or liquidation) of Entain Group plc, or a data controller or any of its group entities;

Where you have self-excluded yourself from gambling, we may share this information with our regulators or other companies in our field where we believe it is important to support your exclusion.
Meeting our Responsible Gambling Obligations
We take responsible gambling very seriously at Entain. We may share your information across our brands in the Entain Group, and where required with other organisations to meet our responsible gambling commitments.
We have an obligation to identify those at harm from gambling as early as we can and help them stop gambling by placing certain limits on accounts; this could include deposit limits, product limits, limiting the ability of an account to gamble certain products / times / periods or, if applicable, stopping entering our shops. In order to meet these obligations, we continuously analyse customer’s transactions and evaluate behaviour or financial status across all of our products and brands, which may lead us to make decisions on your account(s).
We are also constantly looking at innovative ways to help spot players who may be on a path to difficulties and identify them digitally and within shops. This means that we may use systems that identify customers (such as facial recognition in our shops, cookies on player’s devices or images sent by you) and internally we have developed systems to understand your play to better communicate any risks concerning your activity. We may also share or receive player data with other organisations who help evaluate risks or assess affordability by looking at how you may interact with other gambling operators or help individuals directly.
In all these cases, please be assured that we take our obligations very seriously, in helping customers gamble responsibly and in protecting your personal information. We will always ensure that we take the most appropriate measures and controls to protect your data.
If you are a customer in the Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the following initiative called “GamProtect” applies to you.
GamProtect (Great Britain and Northern Ireland Players only)
GamProtect is a scheme aimed at people who tell us that they are at high-risk from gambling related harm to their health. For full information about how personal data is managed under this scheme please see the GamProtect website
