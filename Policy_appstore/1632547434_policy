Privacy
Flowx does not collect, store, share or sell any personal or non-personal data.
All weather data downloaded during use of Flowx is downloaded from Flowx (flowx.io) servers.
These servers do not collect, store, share or sell any data associated with download requests.
Flowx does use some third-party services, which are listed below along with links to their privacy policies.
You may have guessed that I firmly believe in respecting people’s privacy.
This is why we don’t ask for unnecessary permission and are trying to reduce third-party services used in Flowx.
Feel free to contact me (Duane Malcolm) if you have any concerns. You can contact me via Feedback in the Flowx app.
Third-Party Services

LocationIQ (Unwired Labs)
LocationIQ is used for autocompletion when you search to add a new place.
LocationIQ/Unwired Labs Privacy Policy
MaxMind
MaxMind is used when you open Flowx for the first time.
MaxMind will return the location of the Internet Service Provider (ISP) associated with your IP address.
Flowx uses this to roughly guess your initial place.
Note, if the ISP timezone does not match the timezone of your phone (maybe because you are using a VPN),
then we will guess your location from your timezone.
MaxMind Privacy Policy

Flowx uses the RevenueCat SDK to easily manage Pro subscriptions.

BugSnag (SmartBear)
In the (rare :-) ) case of a crash, Flowx uses the BugSnag to capture ever important crash logs.
