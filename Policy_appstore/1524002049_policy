Profiling
​
If your club chooses to use the services of authorised consulting partners then the following additional condition applies.  It ONLY applies if there is a written agreement between such a service provider and your club.  If no agreement exists, the following clause does not apply.
Your club does not carry out automatic decision-making but with the consent of the club, such an entity will systematically analyse the clubs database and the information that the club holds about you, in order to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness and relevance of their communication with you (profiling). You will be informed about this as soon as possible, but at the latest when the club makes contact with you as a result of such profiling by reference to this privacy statement.
The club may sometimes use geo-demographic and/or other personal information which may include identification of individuals’ capacity to give, through a process called ‘wealth screening’, using publicly available information sources. The club may also carry out their own research into their supporters, again using publicly available information or information that you provide the club with. This allows the club to tailor their fundraising and marketing activities to make them as appropriate as possible for their supporters and reflect their interests as closely as possible.
If you would prefer us not to process your personal data for the purpose of wealth screening, the club will respect your wishes. If you do not wish to be subject to such profiling or wealth screening or wish to update your contact preferences, please contact ClubSpot on 049-4306900, who will happily address your request or email
