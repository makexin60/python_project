Crash Reports
This no longer uses Googleâ€™s Crashlytics system for crash reporting as of version 12.11.
Crash reports are now only provided through the default system of iOS and is therefore entirely voluntary. Consequently the number of crash reports available to troubleshoot potential issues will be reduced but the increase in privacy is worth it.
Personally, on my own devices I choose to share system default crash reports with developers.
