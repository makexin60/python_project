FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur, we will notify you via email and in-app notification within 7 business days.
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individual have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have here. We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individual have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
We believe in being accountable for the personal information we collect and process. We have designated a Privacy Officer who is responsible for overseeing our privacy practices, and we regularly review and update our policies and procedures to ensure that they are in line with current best practices and legal requirements.
In addition to these general principles, we also adhere to specific regulations and laws that govern the handling of personal information. For example, for users who are California residents, we comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which provides additional rights and protections for residents of that state. We also comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users who are residents of the European Union, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) for users who are residents of Canada.
Overall, our commitment to fair information practices is a fundamental aspect of how we operate the PLC Animator Platform. We understand that users trust us with their personal information, and we take that trust very seriously. By following these principles, we aim to build and maintain that trust, and ensure that users feel confident using our services.
