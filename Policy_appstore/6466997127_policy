This Privacy Policy explains:
why and how we may use the personal information that we have obtained from interactions you (or others) may have with us as a business or when you contact us;
with whom we share your personal information; and
the rights you have in connection with the information we use.
Please read the following carefully.
2. WHO WE ARE AND OUR ROLE
Except as mentioned below, Stonegate Pub Company Limited is the controller of your personal information. This means that Stonegate Limited decides why and how your personal information is processed. Please see the section at the end of this Privacy Policy and our
Terms of Use
for our contact and legal information respectively.
We sometimes work with other organisations in connection with some of the processing activities described in this notice, such as social media platforms. Where that information is collected and sent to other organisations for processing that is for a common purpose or purposes, we will be making decisions together in relation to that particular processing and will be 'joint controllers' with the organisations involved. As joint controllers, we and the other organisations involved in making these decisions will be jointly responsible to you under data protection laws for this processing.
In other circumstances, the organisation receiving your information will be separately responsible to you and use your personal information in the ways described in its privacy policy (and not ours). For example:
If you link your payment card to your loyalty programme account through a third party banking app, the relevant bank that issues that payment card and card scheme (American Express, Mastercard or Visa) will be processing your personal information in accordance with its privacy policies as separate controllers. Please see the relevant website of the bank or scheme for the relevant privacy policy.
We may make WiFi services available in our venues and where we do, these are provided by our third party service provider, Purple WiFi. Purple WiFi is a separate controller of the personal information it collects during the course of its provision of those services. Please its privacy policy at https://purple.ai/privacy-policy/ for further information.
If you apply for a job through our websites, our separate
Recruitment Privacy Policy

4. HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose and complies with data protection laws.
Data protection law requires us to have a valid reason to process your personal information for each of the different purposes for which we use that information. The law refers to each reason as a 'lawful basis'. The purposes for which we use your personal information and the lawful basis on which we rely to process it for each purpose is as follows:
Where you have provided CONSENT
We may use and process your personal information where you have consented for us to do so for the following purposes:
to make electronic marketing communications including by email, SMS and, in relation to our mobile apps, push notices, where you opt-in to receive such communications following a request;
to access location, camera, photos, videos, contact lists, or other information from your mobile device accessed through our mobile apps;
to collect personal information from non-essential cookies used on our websites for the purposes described in our
Cookie Policy
;
to link your card payment method to our loyalty programme and use the transaction data we receive to administer our loyalty programme. Your consent for this purpose will also permit the card
scheme relevant to your card to monitor your transactions and share details of qualifying purchases with us so that we can provide you with the relevant points.
We may also rely on consent to use your name and image for publicity purposes. If you do not agree, the photographs will be deleted or the image will be modified so you will be unidentifiable.
You may withdraw your consent for us to use your information in any of these ways at any time. Please see section 13 (Your Rights) for further details.

7. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your personal information may be transferred to countries outside the UK. Those countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so may not protect the use of your personal information to the same standard.
Where we transfer your information outside of the UK, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy. These steps include:
relying on decisions issued by the relevant UK Secretary of State (or other relevant person) declaring that a country or a company certifying to an international framework is adequately protective of personal information to a degree that allows us to safely transfer your personal information to that country or company;
imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information using standard clauses issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (or other relevant body); or
relying on 'binding corporate rules' put in place by recipients of your personal information that have been approved by relevant data protection regulators.

If you use our services whilst you are outside the UK, your information may be transferred outside the UK in order to receive those services.
8. THE PERIOD FOR WHICH WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If we collect your personal information, the length of time for which we retain it is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws. We do not retain personal information in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.
We will always retain your personal information for the period that you have an active account with a Website or App. If you do not hold an account, we retain your personal information for 2 years from the date we collect it or, where applicable, the date you are unsubscribed from our marketing lists, if later.
Your account will become ‘inactive’ if you do not engage with us for more than 2 years, for example, if you do not log into your account, make a purchase with us, engage with our direct marketing campaigns, earn loyalty points or redeem any vouchers. After that 2 year period ends (or at any point you choose to delete your account with the relevant Website or App using the relevant settings), we will anonymise the records we hold about you so that we no longer hold your personal information (to find out more about the personal information we anonymise, please see ‘Personal information we collected about you’ above)3 years after the date we or you close your account with the relevant Website or App. The only exceptions to these periodis and our retention of your personal information are where:
the law requires us to hold your personal information for a longer period, or delete it sooner;
you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see section 13 (Your Rights) below);
you exercise your right to require us to retain your personal information for a period longer than our stated retention period (see section 13 (Your Rights) below);
we obtain your proof of identity documentation (e.g. driving licence, passport, card bearing PASS hologram, or military ID) which we retain for no more than 31 days from the date of our receipt or, if you are subject to a ban from a venue, for the period for which you have been banned; or
we bring or defend a legal claim or other proceedings during the period we retain your personal information, in which case we will retain your personal information until those proceedings have concluded and no further appeals are possible.
9. SECURITY AND LINKS TO OTHER SITES
We employ security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us, to prevent access by unauthorised persons and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. When we have provided (or you have chosen) a password allowing you access to certain parts of our Digital Services, you are responsible for safeguarding it and keeping it confidential and you promise not to allow it to be used by third parties.
If you are using a computer or terminal in a public location, we recommend that you always log out and close the website browser when you complete an online session for your security. In addition, we recommend that you take the following security measures to enhance your online safety: When creating a password, we recommend you use at least 8 characters with a combination of letters and numbers and at least one special character. We recommend you frequently change your password. Keep your passwords private. Remember, anyone you knows your password may access your account. Avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. We will never ask you to confirm any account or credit card details via email. If you receive an email claiming to be from us or stonegategroup.co.uk asking you to do so, please ignore it and do not respond.
Our Digital Services may contain links to websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those other websites‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience.

PRIVACY POLICY
1. INTRODUCTION
Welcome to our Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy
This Privacy Policy provides information on how we collect and processes your personal data when you visit our venues, use our websites (including any data which you may provide through those websites when you contact us or provide feedback), make a booking, visit or interact with us via our WiFi facilities or social media pages, or when you use our mobile apps, or otherwise engage with us, including when you participate in our loyalty programme or other promotions (together, "Digital Services").
This Privacy Policy explains:
why and how we may use the personal information that we have obtained from interactions you (or others) may have with us as a business or when you contact us;
with whom we share your personal information; and
the rights you have in connection with the information we use.
Please read the following carefully.
2. WHO WE ARE AND OUR ROLE
Except as mentioned below, Stonegate Pub Company Limited is the controller of your personal information. This means that Stonegate Limited decides why and how your personal information is processed. Please see the section at the end of this Privacy Policy and our
Terms of Use
for our contact and legal information respectively.
We sometimes work with other organisations in connection with some of the processing activities described in this notice, such as social media platforms. Where that information is collected and sent to other organisations for processing that is for a common purpose or purposes, we will be making decisions together in relation to that particular processing and will be 'joint controllers' with the organisations involved. As joint controllers, we and the other organisations involved in making these decisions will be jointly responsible to you under data protection laws for this processing.
In other circumstances, the organisation receiving your information will be separately responsible to you and use your personal information in the ways described in its privacy policy (and not ours). For example:
If you link your payment card to your loyalty programme account through a third party banking app, the relevant bank that issues that payment card and card scheme (American Express, Mastercard or Visa) will be processing your personal information in accordance with its privacy policies as separate controllers. Please see the relevant website of the bank or scheme for the relevant privacy policy.
We may make WiFi services available in our venues and where we do, these are provided by our third party service provider, Purple WiFi. Purple WiFi is a separate controller of the personal information it collects during the course of its provision of those services. Please its privacy policy at https://purple.ai/privacy-policy/ for further information.
If you apply for a job through our websites, our separate
Recruitment Privacy Policy
will apply.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so please check this Privacy Policy occasionally to ensure that you are happy with any changes. For more information on changes to our Privacy Policy, please see section 14 (Changes to this Privacy Policy).

4. HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose and complies with data protection laws.
Data protection law requires us to have a valid reason to process your personal information for each of the different purposes for which we use that information. The law refers to each reason as a 'lawful basis'. The purposes for which we use your personal information and the lawful basis on which we rely to process it for each purpose is as follows:
Where you have provided CONSENT
We may use and process your personal information where you have consented for us to do so for the following purposes:
to make electronic marketing communications including by email, SMS and, in relation to our mobile apps, push notices, where you opt-in to receive such communications following a request;
to access location, camera, photos, videos, contact lists, or other information from your mobile device accessed through our mobile apps;
to collect personal information from non-essential cookies used on our websites for the purposes described in our
Cookie Policy
;
to link your card payment method to our loyalty programme and use the transaction data we receive to administer our loyalty programme. Your consent for this purpose will also permit the card
scheme relevant to your card to monitor your transactions and share details of qualifying purchases with us so that we can provide you with the relevant points.
We may also rely on consent to use your name and image for publicity purposes. If you do not agree, the photographs will be deleted or the image will be modified so you will be unidentifiable.
You may withdraw your consent for us to use your information in any of these ways at any time. Please see section 13 (Your Rights) for further details.

7. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your personal information may be transferred to countries outside the UK. Those countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so may not protect the use of your personal information to the same standard.
Where we transfer your information outside of the UK, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy. These steps include:
relying on decisions issued by the relevant UK Secretary of State (or other relevant person) declaring that a country or a company certifying to an international framework is adequately protective of personal information to a degree that allows us to safely transfer your personal information to that country or company;
imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information using standard clauses issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (or other relevant body); or
relying on 'binding corporate rules' put in place by recipients of your personal information that have been approved by relevant data protection regulators.

If you use our services whilst you are outside the UK, your information may be transferred outside the UK in order to receive those services.
8. THE PERIOD FOR WHICH WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If we collect your personal information, the length of time for which we retain it is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws. We do not retain personal information in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.
We will always retain your personal information for the period that you have an active account with a Website or App. If you do not hold an account, we retain your personal information for 2 years from the date we collect it or, where applicable, the date you are unsubscribed from our marketing lists, if later.
Your account will become ‘inactive’ if you do not engage with us for more than 2 years, for example, if you do not log into your account, make a purchase with us, engage with our direct marketing campaigns, earn loyalty points or redeem any vouchers. After that 2 year period ends (or at any point you choose to delete your account with the relevant Website or App using the relevant settings), we will anonymise the records we hold about you so that we no longer hold your personal information (to find out more about the personal information we anonymise, please see ‘Personal information we collected about you’ above)3 years after the date we or you close your account with the relevant Website or App. The only exceptions to these periodis and our retention of your personal information are where:
the law requires us to hold your personal information for a longer period, or delete it sooner;
you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see section 13 (Your Rights) below);
you exercise your right to require us to retain your personal information for a period longer than our stated retention period (see section 13 (Your Rights) below);
we obtain your proof of identity documentation (e.g. driving licence, passport, card bearing PASS hologram, or military ID) which we retain for no more than 31 days from the date of our receipt or, if you are subject to a ban from a venue, for the period for which you have been banned; or
we bring or defend a legal claim or other proceedings during the period we retain your personal information, in which case we will retain your personal information until those proceedings have concluded and no further appeals are possible.
9. SECURITY AND LINKS TO OTHER SITES
We employ security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us, to prevent access by unauthorised persons and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. When we have provided (or you have chosen) a password allowing you access to certain parts of our Digital Services, you are responsible for safeguarding it and keeping it confidential and you promise not to allow it to be used by third parties.
If you are using a computer or terminal in a public location, we recommend that you always log out and close the website browser when you complete an online session for your security. In addition, we recommend that you take the following security measures to enhance your online safety: When creating a password, we recommend you use at least 8 characters with a combination of letters and numbers and at least one special character. We recommend you frequently change your password. Keep your passwords private. Remember, anyone you knows your password may access your account. Avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. We will never ask you to confirm any account or credit card details via email. If you receive an email claiming to be from us or stonegategroup.co.uk asking you to do so, please ignore it and do not respond.
Our Digital Services may contain links to websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those other websites‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience.

What Information We Collect
” to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described
here
