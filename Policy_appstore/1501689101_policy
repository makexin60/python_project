Customers
Since the implementation of Squadcast, we‚Äôve managed to reduce the number of incoming alerts from tens of thousands to hundreds, all thanks to the flexible deduplication mechanism. Squadcast brings simplicity and flexibility and has a direct effect on the decrease in alert fatigue and the increase of awareness.

Privacy Policy
Last updated on October 8th, 2024
Squadcast, Inc. (‚ÄúSquadcast‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) provides a number of ‚ÄúServices‚Äù through our cloud based application and platform for Incident response orchestration, alert management, Incident tracking, Incident resolution automation and any related analytics, provided by means of a software via
https://www.squadcast.com
(or at such other URL as Squadcast may designate from time to time), that includes but is not limited to any related application programming interfaces (API), interactive discussion areas, customer accounts and profiles, mobile applications, and other related components thereof, on an individual and collective basis (‚ÄúServices‚Äù or ‚ÄúService‚Äù). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the use of information and other data that we collect from our website at
https://squadcast.com
(‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù) and through our Services. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy: (i) ‚ÄúPersonally Identifiable Information‚Äù or ‚ÄúPII‚Äù means information that can be used on its own or in combination with other information to identify or contact you, your Users, or your Contact Persons, such as name, phone number and/or e-mail address and (ii) ‚ÄúAnonymous Information,‚Äù means information that is not associated with or linked to your PII and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
User Consent
By using our website, submitting or making available information through our Website or Services as described below, you agree to the Terms of Service posted by us on
https://squadcast.com/terms
and the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In connection with providing Services, Squadcast acts as a data processor, not a data controller. This means that Squadcast follows your instructions as to how to use your PII. While we primarily process your data on servers located in the United States, your data may also be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries if necessary to do so as part of the Services. The laws in such other countries regarding the use and processing of data may be more or less stringent than the laws in the United States or your country. For example, when an alarm trigger set by you occurs, the Services will automatically retrieve the Contact Information supplied by you and use the method(s) you established to contact the applicable Contact Person. This will require telephoning or sending an email or SMS message or using other means to contact such Contact Person wherever they are located, which may not be the United States or your home country. Of necessity this means PII will be transmitted in or through the networks, servers, telephone system and so forth in the country where the Contact Person is located. You consent, and hereby authorize and assume responsibility, for Squadcast to use your data in this manner as part of offering the Services.
What Data We Collect
Information Provided by Visitors: If you visit our Website or use our Services, we may collect PII from you, including, but not limited to, first and last name, organization name, e-mail address and password if you decide to register to receive information, schedule a demo, or create an account to use the Services. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of our services, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of our services, such as photos, comments, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù) or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information from third party sources in order to deliver a better experience of our products/services. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Squadcast community.
Information that We may Collect via Technological Means: Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect data from you, such as browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access our services to assist with ad targeting. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network. We may also directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual User. We also use various technical mechanisms such as cookies, pixels, clear GIFS and so forth to monitor how you are using our website and Services. ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer‚Äôs hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may link the information we store in cookies or through other mechanisms to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. You can also disable all cookies on your Internet browser. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly. The use of cookies and other mechanisms by our partners, affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement as we do not have access or control over them.
Information that we may collect from our Customers: If you decide to purchase the Services and become a Squadcast customer (‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù), we will need to collect additional information from you.First, we ‚Äì or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf ‚Äì will collect your payment information, such as a credit card number or account information. All of this is your PII. Second, you will need to set up your profile to be able to use the Services. This includes, among other things, telling us how to contact you or your organization when faults are detected by the organization‚Äôs monitoring tools, creating accounts for the on-call engineers on your team, and allowing permission to access information relevant to your account available from other tools you use. You will be able to set up your preferred contact methods (e.g., phone, SMS, email and/or push notifications) and you will be required to provide the applicable contact information (‚ÄúContact Information‚Äù), parts of which will also be PII. If you or your Users are supplying PII for Contact Persons, your represent and warrant that you have the right to provide such information.
How We Use the Data We Collect
We use PII for two basic purposes: to provide and improve the Website and to provide and improve the Services.

We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Squadcast or any other tool from which you have connected to Squadcast (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from any other application/tool/website with whom you have registered to receive such notifications. We may use this e-mail address to contact you, for things such as notifications of limited edition shop sales and other related information. However, you may indicate your preference at any time to stop receiving further promotional communications.
When We May Disclose Data
We may share your data with third parties as part of providing the Services. This will include, among other things, to provide technical support, to process payments, and to contact your organization when an alarm is triggered. Third parties may include, among others, payment processors, technical support organizations, server and network hosts, telephone and messaging operators, and other telecommunications organizations. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your PII (as described below), we may disclose PII if it is believed in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Squadcast or users of the Services or related services.

We may share aggregate or anonymous data (including personal data that has been stripped of personally identifying characteristics) with third parties as part of providing our Service. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the PII collected from our Services or the Website to third parties other than as outlined in this policy, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.

You understand that when you use Squadcast, certain information you post or provide through Squadcast, such as your name, profile, comments, posts and ratings, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of Squadcast, including without limitation, chat rooms, bulletin and message boards, along with other public forums. If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, along with any associated Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback but will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that any such comments and any email we receive becomes our property. We may use feedback for marketing purposes or to add to or modify our services without paying any royalties or other compensation to you.

Please do not disclose your account password to anyone else. Despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% risk-free, and Squadcast does not warrant or guarantee that your PII will be secure in all circumstances.
