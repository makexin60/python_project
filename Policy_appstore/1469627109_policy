CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), requires us to make specific disclosures about how we collect, use, disclose the personal information of California residents who are subject to CCPA (we call this specific personal information “PI”). CCPA also grants such California residents certain rights related to their PI.
This section describes our PI practices offline and online, and contains these required disclosures and instructions for California residents who wish to exercise their rights under CCPA.
Please note that, to the extent permitted under CCPA, this California Privacy Notice does not apply to the PI of California residents that we collect for employment-related purposes.
The chart below provides a description of the types of PI we may collect. It also describes the business or commercial purpose(s) for which we may collect, use and disclose PI, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared or sold each type of PI in the past twelve (12) months. Below the chart, we have outlined the criteria we use to determine how long such PI will be retained. We may collect the categories of PI described in the chart as described in the “
HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION
” section of our Policy. We may share PI we collect as described in the “
HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
” section of this Policy.
CCPA contains specific definitions for “sharing” PI and “selling” PI. These definitions
only
apply to this California Privacy Notice, and do not apply to the rest of our Policy. “Share” or “sharing” means, in short, sharing PI for cross-contextual advertising purposes. “Sale” or “selling” is defined very broadly and includes the disclosure of PI for monetary or valuable consideration. Note that as of the date of the Policy, we do not knowingly “sell” or “share” PI, including the PI of consumers under the age of 16 years. This statement is based on our understanding of how these terms are defined under CCPA.

Our PI retention criteria:
CCPA requires that we disclose the criteria we use to determine how long we will retain each category of PI in the chart above. Oftentimes, our records contain several of these categories of PI combined together and therefore we consider, on a case-by-case basis, a number of factors to assess how long PI is retained. These factors include what PI is reasonably necessary to (i) provide our products and services or administer our relationship with a consumer; (ii) protect our business, employees, organization and others; (iii) fulfill our legal and regulatory obligations; and (iv) investigate and address issues which may include safety concerns, potential security incidents or policy violations.
Disclosures for Business Purposes:
In the past twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of PI for “business purposes,” as defined in CCPA: identifiers, commercial information, internet or similar network activity; geolocation information; audio, electronic, visual or similar information; professional information; and inferences drawn from other PI. We may have  disclosed these categories of PI to employers in the past 12 months for business purposes, if your employer utilizes our Platform.
California resident rights under CCPA.
Subject to certain exclusions included in CCPA, and as relevant to our operations, California residents have the rights listed below with respect to the PI that we maintain about them. We may take steps to verify your identity, as permitted or required under CCPA, before we process your request. Verification may include asking you to provide information about yourself that we can match against information already in our possession.
This means that you can request that we disclose what PI we have collected about you, including the categories of PI, the categories of sources from which the PI is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing PI, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed PI, and the specific pieces of PI we have collected about the consumer.
This means that you can request that we delete PI about you which we have collected from you.
This means that you can request that we correct inaccurate PI that we maintain about you.
Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of PI
. CCPA provides a right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of PI.
Note that as of the date of this Policy, we do not knowingly “sell” or “share” PI, including the PI of consumers under the age of 16 years. This statement is based on our understanding of how these terms are defined under CCPA.
Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive PI.
The CCPA provides a right for consumers to request that business limit the use or disclosure of their “sensitive” PI. In our normal business operations, we do not process “sensitive PI” as that term is defined under CCPA. Please do not submit this information to us.
Right to Non-Discrimination.
This means that we are prohibited from discriminating against you if you exercise your rights under CCPA.
California residents who wish to exercise their rights under this section can contact us at
info@washlaundry.com
. Please include your name, email address and address and indicate you are a California resident making a “CCPA” request.
Agents.
Agents that you have authorized to act on your behalf may also submit CCPA requests as instructed above. The agent must also provide evidence that they have your written permission to submit a request on your behalf. If we are unable to verify the authenticity of a request, we may ask you for more information or may deny the request.
Additional Information about your California Rights.
If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared PI with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email at
info@washlaundry.com
. Indicate in your email or letter that you are a California resident making a “California Shine the Light” inquiry.
NEVADA PRIVACY NOTICE

As of the date of this Policy, we do not knowingly engage in the “sale” of personal information of Nevada residents. This statement is based on our understanding of how the term “sale” is defined under 603A as of the date of this Policy. However, Nevada residents who wish to exercise their rights under this section can email us at
info@washlaundry.com
.
In your request, please specify that you are a Nevada resident making a “Nevada Opt-Out” request.
