Our Story
Tony Robinson, the founder of SoSweet, has been a stalwart in the food industry for over 40 years. His depth of knowledge, paired with the retail and wholesale expertise of his wife, Sam, shaped the foundation of SoSweet. From our humble beginnings as a fruit and veg business, an unexpected opportunity in 2009 allowed us to tap into the vibrant world of sweets. We took the leap, setting up pop-up shops in various locations and slowly but surely, forged our unique path in the confectionery industry.
The entrance of their son, George, in 2018 marked a pivotal point in our journey. George's keen eye for innovation identified multiple industry gaps, leading to the creation of an array of solutions that redefined our customer's experience. This transformative digital evolution was characterized by a wave of safe, user-friendly, and appealing ways to indulge in the best sweets on the market.
