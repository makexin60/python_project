Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use the Garmin Connect website, mobile app, and compatible Garmin devices.
What Personal Data Does Garmin collect?
Garmin Connect was created to help you track your fitness and wellness and pursue your personal goals. We ask you for personal data — such as height, weight, and sleep times — to help you reach those goals and provide you with personalized insights and stats.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Add a Device
When you add a Garmin device to your Garmin Connect account, we ask for information such as your height, weight, gender, and birthdate so we can personalize your stats and goals. We store information such as your sleep and wake times so we don't send you "get moving" notifications while you're sleeping. We also store your recorded activities and heart rate, so you can tell when you beat that PR or lower your fitness age.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync your device, we collect data such as your IP address, sync time and date, and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support. We also collect usage and trend data to help us improve our features and apps.
When You Use Location Features
Services such as GPS tracking during a run or weather updates on your device require that Garmin collect your location at that time. Your GPS data during activities does get uploaded to Garmin Connect, but you have control over who sees it from there.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

DO YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO GARMIN?
You can still use your device without uploading data to Garmin. However, most of the features of the Garmin Connect app or website will be limited or unavailable.

Why does Garmin ask for your personal data?
From providing product support to offering motivation to reach your goals, the information we ask for is used to improve your Garmin Connect experiences.

To Give You Personalised Stats and Insights
We use personal data, such as height, weight, gender and age, to provide you more accurate stats, such as how many calories you burn during an activity, and insights, such as how you compare to similar users.
To Help You Track Your Activities, Competitions and Goals
If you choose to upload data from your Garmin device to Garmin Connect, we collect recorded data from those activities so you can analyse it and track your progress toward your goals. If you want to, you can even share your activity data with others. Plus, you can withdraw your consent and delete activities at any time.
If you’re opted-in to product improvement, we internally process activity data to help us improve on our products and services. Again, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
To Keep You Informed
When we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.
To Improve Our Sites and Apps
When you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your IP address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.

Does Garmin sell your personal data?
No! We don’t sell your personal data to anyone. And we only share your personal data with others in specific situations.

Data Shared with Emergency Responders
If you use the Assistance Plus feature, Garmin will provide relevant data to emergency responders to provide them with any information they might need to assist you when an incident is detected or you request assistance from your Garmin device.
Data Shared with Emergency Contacts
You can add emergency contacts to your account. In the event of a detected incident or an assistance request, Garmin will reach out to your emergency contacts to collect additional information and provide incident updates.
If you are added as an emergency contact by a Garmin customer or someone sends you a LiveTrack invitation, Garmin stores the contact information required to fulfill those services.
Data Shared Within Garmin
Garmin is global, which means that Garmin has companies all over the world that work together to provide our products/services and support our business. No matter which Garmin company handles your information, it is still secured under this privacy policy.
Data Shared with Service Providers
We share personal data with third parties who provide services — such as analytics and hosting services and sending emails to customers — for us.
Data Shared for Legal Reasons
We will share your personal data when required to by law enforcement and in other legal matters.

Activity Data
Your activity data is set to private by default. If you want others to see your daily runs and cheer you on, you can adjust your privacy settings to allow that. You can also like or comment on other activities in your news feed, and those likes and comments will be visible to others.
Competitions and Challenges
When you join a Leaderboard or Challenge, other participants will be able to see your activity data and any comments you submit to the Leaderboard or Challenge. This includes anyone who is part of your Garmin Jr. family account — even if they aren’t part of that Challenge and your account is set to private.
When you participate in Garmin Sports competitions, the people you’re competing with will be able to see activity data for that competition.
Connections
When you join groups or make connections, depending on your privacy settings, some or all of your profile and activity data may be visible to those groups or connections.
Third-party Apps
We will not share your activity data with third parties unless you tell us to. For example, you can instruct Garmin Connect to share your activity data with a third-party wellness program provider or apps such as MyFitnessPal and Strava.
LIVETRACK
You can share a link to your device’s real-time location with your friends and family so they can follow along as you run.
Account Sharing
You can choose to share your Garmin Connect account information with another person for medical or other reasons. You can stop sharing this information at any time.
