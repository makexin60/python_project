​
GOOGLE USER DATA
​
Some of our applications have the ability to connect to your Google Drive account, allowing you to manage files, edit audio tags for media files, and play media content located in your Google Drive account. Once you connect your Google Drive account to the application, it uses an OAuth access token and the official Google Drive SDK
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk
to handle requests to the Google Drive server.
We do not store any of your personal information when you connect your Google Drive account. All your personal information and connection data, including the access token, are securely stored locally on your device in the Keychain, a secure system storage.
You have control over your access. If you ever wish to revoke access to your Google Drive account, you can do so at any time by opening the account settings page in your web browser. Follow the steps outlined here:
https://www.everappz.com/post/how-to-disconnect-third-party-app-from-your-google-account
.
Additionally, within the application settings, you can disconnect your Google Drive account, and all connection data, including the access token, will be removed from your device. You can conveniently download your personal files from the connected Google Drive account to your device, and these files will be placed in the App Documents directory. You can remove these files at any time using the built-in file manager in the application.
Our applications do not share any information from your Google account. Our use and handling of data obtained from Google APIs comply with Google API Services User Data Policy
https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy
, including the Limited Use requirements.
​
GOOGLE MOBILE ADS
​
Some of our applications use Google Mobile Ads SDK for monetization.
To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps, including:
IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
Non-user-related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
Other user-product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.
SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR DATA
​
At EVERAPPZ SL, we have adopted all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the personal data you have provided. These measures are taken to prevent alteration, loss, or unauthorized processing, as required by law, although absolute security does not exist.
Similarly, the staff of EVERAPPZ SL is committed to handling your data with the utmost care and confidentiality.
