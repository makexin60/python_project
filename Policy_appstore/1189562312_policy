2. WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA AND DATA PROCESSING
?
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be established, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of that person’s physical, physiological, economic, cultural or social identity. A personal data processing operation is any operation or set of operations that we perform on personal data, such as collecting, recording, storing, storing, using and disclosing the data.
3. THROUGH WHICH CHANNELS DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA?
We collect personal data from Users in the following ways:
By accessing our Games, available online and/or on the App.
SPACE GO informs Users that, depending on the game they are accessing, it may or may not be necessary to register as a User. SPACE GO makes available to Users Games that can be accessed as a guest, without the need to register, and others in which it is necessary to register as a guest. It is also possible to access the Games from your Facebook, Google or Apple account, in which case you must be registered and have a user account on that social network or platform.
Either way, from the moment the Game is accessed, SPACE GO assigns a User ID number to the player, which allows SPACE GO to identify and remember the player as a User. For better reference, although an ID number is not a piece of information that directly identifies a physical person, it is a piece of information that allows the user to be identified or identifiable if it is associated with additional information, such as name, email address or any other additional information that the User provides through the interaction channels that SPACE GO has enabled for this purpose.
When accessing SPACE GO via Facebook, Google or Apple account or having downloaded the Game application through the App Store or Google Play, SPACE GO stores the ID that the social network or application has assigned and if the User wants to add the profile picture to their Game profile, SPACE GO can also access that picture.
Through the use and enjoyment of the Games and the Website.
By means of the User service through the channels provided for this purpose.
By answering satisfaction surveys.
