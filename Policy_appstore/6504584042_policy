Face Data Collection and Use for React Native MLKit App Users
Our React Native MLKit app collects facial images and associated data solely for on-device processing to perform face detection and recognition tasks. The data includes facial landmarks and features necessary for these functionalities. All processing occurs locally on the device and no face data is transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties, and is deleted from the device's memory once the process is completed.
This section applies exclusively to users of our React Native MLKit app.
