Disclosure to Successors
If our business is sold or merges in whole or in part with another business that would become responsible for providing Famous Birthdays to you, we retain the right to transfer any information to the new business.
Celebrity Personal Information
Celebrities are people too, and the information we share to the public about celebrities will in some cases be subject to privacy rights.

We carefully consider both sets of rights with reference to applicable law and regulation on a case-by-case basis when making determinations on any celebrity privacy requests.
We are committed to accuracy in all of our published information and we will generally consider updates and corrections. We do not accept facts received directly from any celebrity under 13 years of age, or from any celebrity under 16 years of age from Europe and the UK.
