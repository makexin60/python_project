PRIVACY POLICY
EXPLANATION OF PRIVACY POLICY NEED AND PURPOSE
Movies @ Cinemas is subject to certain laws that regulate how Movies @ Cinemas can collect, store, use, or otherwise process your personal data. At Movies @ Cinemas we value the importance of protecting privacy and personal data. While we have to reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time without prior notice, our data processing will always remain fair, transparent, and lawful. This policy is Movies @ Cinemas public affirmation of how we intend to fulfil that goal.
ORGANISATION IDENTITY
Movies @ Cinemas – Movies @ Dundrum/Swords/The Square are companies located at Dundrum Town Centre, Sandyford Road, Dundrum, Dublin 16, Pavilions Shopping Centre, Swords, Dublin and at The Square, Tallaght
Email:
gdpr@movies-at.ie
The assigned Data Protection Controller is Graham Spurling.
SCOPE
This policy only concerns itself with the processing of personal data. The types of personal data that Movies @ Cinemas may process will vary and depend on the interactions that a person has with Movies @ Cinemas. Specific policies may apply to your relationship with Movies @ Cinemas in addition to this general statement of policy, for example if you are an employee with specific policies to your role. Those specific policies will take precedence over any conflicting provision in this Privacy Policy. If you are unsure or would like to ask what policies we consider apply to your relationship with Movies @ Cinemas please send an email to our data protection officer at: gdpr@movies-at.ie.
DEFINITIONS
Personal data is data that relates to an identified or identifiable person. If data does not permit us or another party to identify a person, directly or indirectly, then it is not personal data. The law does not require, and it is not Movies @ Cinemas practice, to acquire extra, unnecessary information solely for the purpose of identifying persons.
When this policy talks of processing, it means almost anything that can be done with personal data: collecting, storing, analysing, communicating, et cetera. This includes processing done with or without computers.
For purposes of this policy, the controller is Movies @ Cinemas. A processor is any vendor or service provider who processes personal data on behalf of Movies @ Cinemas.
Consent is a clear, unambiguous action by a person that they agree to a specific processing. In order for this consent to be valid, the person consenting has to understand the purpose, nature, and conditions of the processing, including, for example, if Movies @ Cinemas will be getting outside help to process personal data.
GDPR means the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (as amended and replaced from time to time)
Sensitive Data means any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
Movies @ Cinemas commits itself to operating on the basis of the following privacy principles:
Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency –
Beyond upholding your legal rights, our aim is to provide our services fairly to you, and to be transparent in the way we process your data.
We will always provide you with a clear statement of the purpose behind a data processing.
We will always provide you with a clear statement on how that processing is compatible with your legal rights, also known as the legal or lawful basis for processing.
One common example of a lawful basis is where processing is necessary for a service or contract that you have requested. Another common basis is where we have a legal obligation to process your data, such as to protect against fraud. Your consent can sometimes also be a legal basis for processing.
Purpose limitation:
We aim to collect your data only for specific, limited purposes that we will specify to you in advance as clearly as we can.
Moreover, in the event we ever rearrange how we do things, we aim never to process your data in a way that is incompatible with the original purposes.
Data Minimisation:
We try only to process the personal data that we really need –no more and no less.
Accuracy:
We will try to correct or erase, depending on what is appropriate in the context, personal data that are inaccurate.
Storage Limitation:
No one needs or wants their data floating around for eternity, so we try to delete data when we no longer need it.
Integrity and Confidentiality:
We protect your data with the appropriate technologies and business practices. We guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage to your data.
Accountability:
We aim to document, as necessary and appropriate, the things we do for your protection.
You also have a number of rights that you can use to check up on us and hold us accountable.
Finally, in addition to holding ourselves accountable, we also demand that our processors commit themselves to the protections you deserve. We aim to be transparent in our choice of processors so that you can hold them accountable too.
Booking Policy :
The Movies @ Cinemas Group is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the data we collect when you visit our website, especially during the ticket purchasing process.
When you buy tickets online, we ask for your
name,
phone number,
email address,
billing address and
credit card details.
It’s important to note that we cannot complete your transaction without this information.
The primary reason we collect your email address is to send your movie tickets directly to you. Additionally, we collect your email and phone number to contact you if there are any changes to the movie schedule or issues with your booking. For processing online transactions, Movies @ Cinemas relies on a third-party payment service. We assure you that we do not retain full card details on our servers.
Moreover, the billing address you provide is a crucial part of the payment process required by the payment provider. This is to ensure the transaction’s security through the AVS (Address Verification Service), which matches your provided address with the one registered with your bank. This verification step is vital for confirming that the transaction can be safely processed.
Rest assured, the information collected through booking and registration is strictly for the purposes mentioned and will not be sold to third parties without your explicit consent. Additionally, we ensure that personal data is automatically deleted once it is no longer necessary for our records.
Your trust is important to us, and we are dedicated to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information in every transaction with Movies @ Cinemas.
WIFI
Where you are using a mobile device whilst in Movies @ Cinemas with its Wi-Fi capability switched on or have access to our free in-house Wi-Fi. We may additionally collect your MAC address and location data whilst you are within Movies @ Cinemas or immediately within its perimeters. If you do not want us to track your device or use your information in this way, please turn off the Wi-Fi capability on your phone or other electronic device within your settings.
As a function of offering free Wi-Fi, your devices MAC address is visible and is recorded within the system. We do not process this data or attempt to connect it to a user for any purpose. These MAC address and connection times are kept for 30 days for statistical reasons. MAC addresses and time schedules are deleted after 30 days.
RIGHTS TO OBJECT OR RESTRICT PROCESSING
You enjoy certain rights and privileges too that are important enough that they get their own section. We’d especially like to draw your attention to your rights to object and to restrict processing.
RIGHT TO OBJECT
European law provides you with a right to object. This means you have an absolute right to tell us to stop processing your personal data for direct marketing.
Where the processing is for purposes other than direct marketing, you should explain to us what it is you’re objecting to and why it is that you’re objecting. Movies @ Cinemas is then entitled at law to consider whether any legitimate grounds override those objections. If not, then Movies @ Cinemas will cease that processing right away.
RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING
European law also provides you with a right called restriction of processing. If objection is like a stop button, then restriction of processing is the pause button: It lets you put a pause on all or certain types of processing.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME
For any processing that is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop that processing, unless there is another basis to continue processing, such as a legal obligation. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing that has already taken place.
FURTHER RIGHTS
You have further legal rights that Movies @ Cinemas must abide by. Here’s a listing of rights that you should keep in mind:
Rights to Information and Access
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
Right to erasure
Right to restriction of processing
Right to data portability
Right to object
Right to avoid automated individual decision-making
RIGHTS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS
“Who?”  You have a legal right to know who we are, who our representative(s) is/are, who our data protection officer is, and contact information for each.
“Who else??”  You have the right to know who, if anyone will receive your information from us. If we didn’t get your personal data from you, we will tell you where we got it.
“What are you doing?”  You have the right to know in advance the purposes behind our data processing. Moreover, you have the legal right to know in advance the legal basis for our processing. We will always tell you where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests.
“Why should I?”  We will always tell you whether providing your personal data is voluntary or obligatory, and what would be the result if you choose not to provide your personal data. In particular, we will tell you if you are legally or contractually required to provide us with personal data.
“Where?”  Not all jurisdictions or countries provide the same legal protections for personal data and privacy as the European Union and its Member States. Therefore, you have the right to know if your data is being sent outside the EU and if so, what appropriate safeguards have been put in place especially to protect your data protection and privacy rights. Whenever this arises, we’ll tell you how to get a copy of the protections in place for your personal data. You have a right to receive other information too. We’ll always provide the following   specifics to you at the appropriate, relevant time, but here’s a list of what you have a right to receive:
“How long?”  You have a right to know how long we’ll keep your data. If we can’t state a hard number, then we’ll tell you the criteria that will determine when we will delete your personal data.
“What information does Movies @ Cinemas have?”  You have a right to hear what it is that we have about you. If you see anything that needs correction or that you’d like deleted, please contact us through our Data Controller at
gdpr@movies-at.ie
“I don’t consent.” If the basis for our processing is your consent, you have a right to   withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing we’ve already undertaken. It also doesn’t have any effect where processing is not based on your consent.
“I’m still unhappy…” If you think your rights have been violated, you have a right to file a complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner.
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data:
We will take every reasonable step to ensure the personal data we process are accurate and up to date. You have the right to inform us of an inaccuracy in data that we process and expect that we will correct it without undue delay. Likewise, if you find that the data we’re processing is incomplete considering the purposes of the processing, you have to right to submit supplementary information. Depending on the circumstances, we might have to ask for some verification of your identity. We’ll do our best to keep those questions to a minimum and to avoid asking for new personal data we don’t already have.
Right to Erasure:
In many cases, you have the right to have your personal data deleted. For more information, email our Data Controller at gdpr@movies-at.ie
DATA PORTABILITY
Right to Data Portability
We understand that sometimes you’ll need to take your data with you. At your request, we’ll provide you with a transferable copy of your data or send it directly (if possible) to your designated recipient. To make this request, please get in touch with the Data Controller at gdpr@movies-at.ie
[NB: This only applies where the lawful basis was either consent or performance of a contract and processing was automated]
Right to Avoid Automated Individual Decision-Making:
At Movies @ Cinemas, all decisions that could affect your rights are human-made! While we use computers to help us in our work, all decisions are made by real people.
EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS
The easiest way for you to exercise the rights above is to contact our Data Controller directly via email. Let our Data Controller know, if possible, what it is that you’re looking for, and what it is that you’d like us to do. If you have multiple requests, please do make sure you state them all clearly so we can act on them all.
We instruct all our employees to identify and appropriately escalate what appear to be subject requests based on the above rights. Employees should usually escalate requests to their Managers, who will be in touch with the Data Controller. The Data Controller may or may not require the assistance of legal advice.
SOURCES OF INFORMATION
We process the following information:
Information you give us
Information your computer shares with us
Information from third party sources
Information you give us:
There are a number of ways that you can provide information to us for processing: When you subscribe to our newsletter, send us any sort of message (text, email, post), or ring us on the phone, you might provide us with information like:
Your identity, including name and other information like mailing address
Your credit card information, such as the card number, security code, billing address, and bank or issuer details
We will always process your information according to the privacy principles we explained above. In particular, we would like to say again that all our processing is limited to the specific purpose that we tell you at the time we collect your data, and is only stored for as long as is strictly necessary.
Information your computer shares with us:
In order for computers to be able to talk to each other, they absolutely have to disclose some minimum information. This can include technical information or practical information.
Technical information means data like your IP address, browser type and version, any browser plug-ins, your time zone and language settings, any login information, and your operating system
Practical information means information like whether you open or respond to our emails, whether you came to our website by clicking on a link at a different website, products or services you searched, browsed, or purchased.
Some of these data are necessary for us to run our website or to respond to your requests, like ticket bookings. Other data are a huge help to us in providing you with better services and maintaining a well-run company. We will always tell you what is necessary and what is voluntary.
Information other parties give us:
Sometimes we receive information about you from other parties. We process personal data received from those parties by the same rules and principles as personal data that you give us directly. Moreover, we will always tell you who gave us your information and their contact information.

DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
Movies @ Cinemas commits itself to operating on the basis of the following privacy principles:
Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency –
Beyond upholding your legal rights, our aim is to provide our services fairly to you, and to be transparent in the way we process your data.
We will always provide you with a clear statement of the purpose behind a data processing.
We will always provide you with a clear statement on how that processing is compatible with your legal rights, also known as the legal or lawful basis for processing.
One common example of a lawful basis is where processing is necessary for a service or contract that you have requested. Another common basis is where we have a legal obligation to process your data, such as to protect against fraud. Your consent can sometimes also be a legal basis for processing.
Purpose limitation:
We aim to collect your data only for specific, limited purposes that we will specify to you in advance as clearly as we can.
Moreover, in the event we ever rearrange how we do things, we aim never to process your data in a way that is incompatible with the original purposes.
Data Minimisation:
We try only to process the personal data that we really need –no more and no less.
Accuracy:
We will try to correct or erase, depending on what is appropriate in the context, personal data that are inaccurate.
Storage Limitation:
No one needs or wants their data floating around for eternity, so we try to delete data when we no longer need it.
Integrity and Confidentiality:
We protect your data with the appropriate technologies and business practices. We guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage to your data.
Accountability:
We aim to document, as necessary and appropriate, the things we do for your protection.
You also have a number of rights that you can use to check up on us and hold us accountable.
Finally, in addition to holding ourselves accountable, we also demand that our processors commit themselves to the protections you deserve. We aim to be transparent in our choice of processors so that you can hold them accountable too.
Booking Policy :
The Movies @ Cinemas Group is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the data we collect when you visit our website, especially during the ticket purchasing process.
When you buy tickets online, we ask for your
name,
phone number,
email address,
billing address and
credit card details.
It’s important to note that we cannot complete your transaction without this information.
The primary reason we collect your email address is to send your movie tickets directly to you. Additionally, we collect your email and phone number to contact you if there are any changes to the movie schedule or issues with your booking. For processing online transactions, Movies @ Cinemas relies on a third-party payment service. We assure you that we do not retain full card details on our servers.
Moreover, the billing address you provide is a crucial part of the payment process required by your payment provider. This is to ensure the transaction’s security through the AVS (Address Verification Service), which matches your provided address with the one registered with your bank. This verification step is vital for confirming that the transaction can be safely processed.
Rest assured, the information collected through booking and registration is strictly for the purposes mentioned and will not be sold to third parties without your explicit consent. Additionally, we ensure that personal data is automatically deleted once it is no longer necessary for our records.
Your trust is important to us, and we are dedicated to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information in every transaction with Movies @ Cinemas.
WIFI
Where you are using a mobile device whilst in Movies @ Cinemas with its Wi-Fi capability switched on or have access to our free in-house Wi-Fi. We may additionally collect your MAC address and location data whilst you are within Movies @ Cinemas or immediately within its perimeters. If you do not want us to track your device or use your information in this way, please turn off the Wi-Fi capability on your phone or other electronic device within your settings.
As a function of offering free Wi-Fi, your devices MAC address is visible and is recorded within the system. We do not process this data or attempt to connect it to a user for any purpose. These MAC address and connection times are kept for 30 days for statistical reasons. MAC addresses and time schedules are deleted after 30 days.
RIGHTS TO OBJECT OR RESTRICT PROCESSING
You enjoy certain rights and privileges too that are important enough that they get their own section. We’d especially like to draw your attention to your rights to object and to restrict processing.
RIGHT TO OBJECT
European law provides you with a right to object. This means you have an absolute right to tell us to stop processing your personal data for direct marketing.
Where the processing is for purposes other than direct marketing, you should explain to us what it is you’re objecting to and why it is that you’re objecting. Movies @ Cinemas is then entitled at law to consider whether any legitimate grounds override those objections. If not, then Movies @ Cinemas will cease that processing right away.
RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING
European law also provides you with a right called restriction of processing. If objection is like a stop button, then restriction of processing is the pause button: It lets you put a pause on all or certain types of processing.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME
For any processing that is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop that processing, unless there is another basis to continue processing, such as a legal obligation. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing that has already taken place.
FURTHER RIGHTS
You have further legal rights that Movies @ Cinemas must abide by. Here’s a listing of rights that you should keep in mind:
Rights to Information and Access
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
Right to erasure
Right to restriction of processing
Right to data portability
Right to object
Right to avoid automated individual decision-making
RIGHTS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS
“Who?”  You have a legal right to know who we are, who our representative(s) is/are, who our data protection officer is, and contact information for each.
“Who else??”  You have the right to know who, if anyone will receive your information from us. If we didn’t get your personal data from you, we will tell you where we got it.
“What are you doing?”  You have the right to know in advance the purposes behind our data processing. Moreover, you have the legal right to know in advance the legal basis for our processing. We will always tell you where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests.
“Why should I?”  We will always tell you whether providing your personal data is voluntary or obligatory, and what would be the result if you choose not to provide your personal data. In particular, we will tell you if you are legally or contractually required to provide us with personal data.
“Where?”  Not all jurisdictions or countries provide the same legal protections for personal data and privacy as the European Union and its Member States. Therefore, you have the right to know if your data is being sent outside the EU and if so, what appropriate safeguards have been put in place especially to protect your data protection and privacy rights. Whenever this arises, we’ll tell you how to get a copy of the protections in place for your personal data. You have a right to receive other information too. We’ll always provide the following   specifics to you at the appropriate, relevant time, but here’s a list of what you have a right to receive:
“How long?”  You have a right to know how long we’ll keep your data. If we can’t state a hard number, then we’ll tell you the criteria that will determine when we will delete your personal data.
“What information does Movies @ Cinemas have?”  You have a right to hear what it is that we have about you. If you see anything that needs correction or that you’d like deleted, please contact us through our Data Controller at
gdpr@movies-at.ie
“I don’t consent.” If the basis for our processing is your consent, you have a right to   withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing we’ve already undertaken. It also doesn’t have any effect where processing is not based on your consent.
“I’m still unhappy…” If you think your rights have been violated, you have a right to file a complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner.
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data:
We will take every reasonable step to ensure the personal data we process are accurate and up to date. You have the right to inform us of an inaccuracy in data that we process and expect that we will correct it without undue delay. Likewise, if you find that the data we’re processing is incomplete considering the purposes of the processing, you have to right to submit supplementary information. Depending on the circumstances, we might have to ask for some verification of your identity. We’ll do our best to keep those questions to a minimum and to avoid asking for new personal data we don’t already have.
Right to Erasure:
In many cases, you have the right to have your personal data deleted. For more information, email our Data Controller at gdpr@movies-at.ie

At Movies @ Gorey we value the importance of protecting privacy and personal data.

SCOPE
This policy only concerns itself with the processing of personal data. The types of personal data that Movies @ Gorey may process will vary and depend on the interactions that a person has with Movies @ Gorey. Specific policies may apply to your relationship with Movies @ Gorey in addition to this general statement of policy, for example if you are an employee with specific policies to your role.

DEFINITIONS
Personal data is data that relates to an identified or identifiable person. If data does not permit us or another party to identify a person, directly or indirectly, then it is not personal data. The law does not require, and it is not Movies @ Gorey practice, to acquire extra, unnecessary information solely for the purpose of identifying persons.
When this policy talks of processing, it means almost anything that can be done with personal data: collecting, storing, analysing, communicating, et cetera. This includes processing done with or without computers.
For purposes of this policy, the controller is Movies @ Gorey. A processor is any vendor or service provider who processes personal data on behalf of Movies @ Gorey.
Consent is a clear, unambiguous action by a person that they agree to a specific processing. In order for this consent to be valid, the person consenting has to understand the purpose, nature, and conditions of the processing, including, for example, if Movies @ Gorey will be getting outside help to process personal data.
GDPR means the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (as amended and replaced from time to time)
Sensitive Data means any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
Movies @ Gorey commits itself to operating on the basis of the following privacy principles:
• Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency –
• Beyond upholding your legal rights, our aim is to provide our services fairly to you, and to be transparent in the way we process your data.
• We will always provide you with a clear statement of the purpose behind a data processing.
• We will always provide you with a clear statement on how that processing is compatible with your legal rights, also known as the legal or lawful basis for processing.
• One common example of a lawful basis is where processing is necessary for a service or contract that you have requested. Another common basis is where we have a legal obligation to process your data, such as to protect against fraud. Your consent can sometimes also be a legal basis for processing.
Purpose limitation –
• We aim to collect your data only for specific, limited purposes that we will specify to you in advance as clearly as we can.
• Moreover, in the event we ever rearrange how we do things, we aim never to process your data in a way that is incompatible with the original purposes.
Data Minimisation –
• We try only to process the personal data that we really need –no more and no less.
Accuracy –
• We will try to correct or erase, depending on what is appropriate in the context, personal data that are inaccurate.
Storage Limitation –
• No one needs or wants their data floating around for eternity, so we try to delete data when we no longer need it.
Integrity and Confidentiality –
• We protect your data with the appropriate technologies and business practices. We guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage to your data.
Accountability –
• We aim to document, as necessary and appropriate, the things we do for your protection.
• You also have a number of rights that you can use to check up on us and hold us accountable.
• Finally, in addition to holding ourselves accountable, we also demand that our processors commit themselves to the protections you deserve. We aim to be transparent in our choice of processors so that you can hold them accountable too.
Booking Policy
–
The Movies @ Cinemas Group is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the data we collect when you visit our website, especially during the ticket purchasing process.
When you buy tickets online, we ask for your
name,
phone number,
email address,
billing address and
credit card details.
It’s important to note that we cannot complete your transaction without this information.
The primary reason we collect your email address is to send your movie tickets directly to you. Additionally, we collect your email and phone number to contact you if there are any changes to the movie schedule or issues with your booking. For processing online transactions, Movies @ Cinemas relies on a third-party payment service. We assure you that we do not retain full card details on our servers.
Moreover, the billing address you provide is a crucial part of the payment process required by the payment provider. This is to ensure the transaction’s security through the AVS (Address Verification Service), which matches your provided address with the one registered with your bank. This verification step is vital for confirming that the transaction can be safely processed.
Rest assured, the information collected through booking and registration is strictly for the purposes mentioned and will not be sold to third parties without your explicit consent. Additionally, we ensure that personal data is automatically deleted once it is no longer necessary for our records.
Your trust is important to us, and we are dedicated to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information in every transaction with Movies @ Cinemas.
WIFI
Where you are using a mobile device whilst in Movies @ Gorey with its Wi-Fi capability switched on or have access to our free in-house Wi-Fi. We may additionally collect your MAC address and location data whilst you are within Movies @ Gorey or immediately within its perimeters.
If you do not want us to track your device or use your information in this way, please turn off the Wi-Fi capability on your phone or other electronic device within your settings.
As a function of offering free Wi-Fi, your devices MAC address is visible and is recorded within the system. We do not process this data or attempt to connect it to a user for any purpose. These MAC address and connection times are kept for 30 days for statistical reasons. MAC addresses and time schedules are deleted after 30 days.
RIGHTS TO OBJECT OR RESTRICT PROCESSING
You enjoy certain rights and privileges too that are important enough that they get their own section. We’d especially like to draw your attention to your rights to object and to restrict processing.
RIGHT TO OBJECT
European law provides you with a right to object. This means you have an absolute right to tell us to stop processing your personal data for direct marketing.
Where the processing is for purposes other than direct marketing, you should explain to us what it is you’re objecting to and why it is that you’re objecting. Movies @ Gorey is then entitled at law to consider whether any legitimate grounds override those objections. If not, then Movies @ Gorey will cease that processing right away.
RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING
European law also provides you with a right called restriction of processing. If objection is like a stop button, then restriction of processing is the pause button: It lets you put a pause on all or certain types of processing.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME
For any processing that is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop that processing, unless there is another basis to continue processing, such as a legal obligation. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing that has already taken place.
FURTHER RIGHTS
You have further legal rights that Movies @ Gorey must abide by. Here’s a listing of rights that you should keep in mind:
• Rights to Information and Access
• Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
• Right to erasure
• Right to restriction of processing
• Right to data portability
• Right to object
• Right to avoid automated individual decision-making
RIGHTS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS
• “Who?”  You have a legal right to know who we are, who our representative(s) is/are, who our data protection officer is, and contact information for each.
• “Who else??”  You have the right to know who, if anyone will receive your information from us. If we didn’t get your personal data from you, we will tell you where we got it.
• “What are you doing?”  You have the right to know in advance the purposes behind our data processing. Moreover, you have the legal right to know in advance the legal basis for our processing. We will always tell you where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests.
• “Why should I?”  We will always tell you whether providing your personal data is voluntary or obligatory, and what would be the result if you choose not to provide your personal data. In particular, we will tell you if you are legally or contractually required to provide us with personal data.
• “Where?”  Not all jurisdictions or countries provide the same legal protections for personal data and privacy as the European Union and its Member States. Therefore, you have the right to know if your data is being sent outside the EU and if so, what appropriate safeguards have been put in place especially to protect your data protection and privacy rights. Whenever this arises, we’ll tell you how to get a copy of the protections in place for your personal data. You have a right to receive other information too. We’ll always provide the following   specifics to you at the appropriate, relevant time, but here’s a list of what you have a right to receive:
• “How long?”  You have a right to know how long we’ll keep your data. If we can’t state a hard number, then we’ll tell you the criteria that will determine when we will delete your personal data.
• “What information does Movies @ Gorey have?”  You have a right to hear what it is that we have about you. If you see anything that needs correction or that you’d like deleted, please contact us through our Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
• “I don’t consent.” If the basis for our processing is your consent, you have a right to   withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing we’ve already undertaken. It also doesn’t have any effect where processing is not based on your consent.
• “I’m still unhappy…” If you think your rights have been violated, you have a right to file a complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner.
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
We will take every reasonable step to ensure the personal data we process are accurate and up to date. You have the right to inform us of an inaccuracy in data that we process and expect that we will correct it without undue delay. Likewise, if you find that the data we’re processing is incomplete considering the purposes of the processing, you have to right to submit supplementary information. Depending on the circumstances, we might have to ask for some verification of your identity. We’ll do our best to keep those questions to a minimum and to avoid asking for new personal data we don’t already have.
Right to Erasure
In many cases, you have the right to have your personal data deleted. For more information, email our Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
DATA PORTABILITY
Right to Data Portability
We understand that sometimes you’ll need to take your data with you. At your request, we’ll provide you with a transferable copy of your data or send it directly (if possible) to your designated recipient. To make this request, please get in touch with the Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
[NB: This only applies where the lawful basis was either consent or performance of a contract and processing was automated]
Right to Avoid Automated Individual Decision-Making
At Movies @ Gorey, all decisions that could affect your rights are human-made! While we use computers to help us in our work, all decisions are made by real people.
EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS
The easiest way for you to exercise the rights above is to contact our Data Controller directly via email. Let our Data Controller know, if possible, what it is that you’re looking for, and what it is that you’d like us to do.

We instruct all our employees to identify and appropriately escalate what appear to be subject requests based on the above rights. Employees should usually escalate requests to their Managers, who will be in touch with the Data Controller. The Data Controller may or may not require the assistance of legal advice.

Information your computer shares with us
In order for computers to be able to talk to each other, they absolutely have to disclose some minimum information. This can include technical information or practical information.

The primary reason we collect your email address is to send your movie tickets directly to you. Additionally, we collect your email and phone number to contact you if there are any changes to the movie schedule or issues with your booking. For processing online transactions, Movies @ Cinemas relies on a third-party payment service. We assure you that we do not retain full card details on our servers.
Moreover, the billing address you provide is a crucial part of the payment process required by the payment provider. This is to ensure the transaction’s security through the AVS (Address Verification Service), which matches your provided address with the one registered with your bank. This verification step is vital for confirming that the transaction can be safely processed.
Rest assured, the information collected through booking and registration is strictly for the purposes mentioned and will not be sold to third parties without your explicit consent. Additionally, we ensure that personal data is automatically deleted once it is no longer necessary for our records.
Your trust is important to us, and we are dedicated to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information in every transaction with Movies @ Cinemas.

RIGHTS TO OBJECT OR RESTRICT PROCESSING
You enjoy certain rights and privileges too that are important enough that they get their own section. We’d especially like to draw your attention to your rights to object and to restrict processing.
RIGHT TO OBJECT
European law provides you with a right to object. This means you have an absolute right to tell us to stop processing your personal data for direct marketing.
Where the processing is for purposes other than direct marketing, you should explain to us what it is you’re objecting to and why it is that you’re objecting. SGC Dungarvan is then entitled at law to consider whether any legitimate grounds override those objections. If not, then SGC Dungarvan will cease that processing right away.
RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING
European law also provides you with a right called restriction of processing. If objection is like a stop button, then restriction of processing is the pause button: It lets you put a pause on all or certain types of processing.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY TIME
For any processing that is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop that processing, unless there is another basis to continue processing, such as a legal obligation. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing that has already taken place.
FURTHER RIGHTS
You have further legal rights that SGC Dungarvan must abide by. Here’s a listing of rights that you should keep in mind:
• Rights to Information and Access
• Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
• Right to erasure
• Right to restriction of processing
• Right to data portability
• Right to object
• Right to avoid automated individual decision-making
RIGHTS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS
• “Who?”  You have a legal right to know who we are, who our representative(s) is/are, who our data protection officer is, and contact information for each.
• “Who else??”  You have the right to know who, if anyone will receive your information from us. If we didn’t get your personal data from you, we will tell you where we got it.
• “What are you doing?”  You have the right to know in advance the purposes behind our data processing. Moreover, you have the legal right to know in advance the legal basis for our processing. We will always tell you where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests.
• “Why should I?”  We will always tell you whether providing your personal data is voluntary or obligatory, and what would be the result if you choose not to provide your personal data. In particular, we will tell you if you are legally or contractually required to provide us with personal data.
• “Where?”  Not all jurisdictions or countries provide the same legal protections for personal data and privacy as the European Union and its Member States. Therefore, you have the right to know if your data is being sent outside the EU and if so, what appropriate safeguards have been put in place especially to protect your data protection and privacy rights. Whenever this arises, we’ll tell you how to get a copy of the protections in place for your personal data. You have a right to receive other information too. We’ll always provide the following   specifics to you at the appropriate, relevant time, but here’s a list of what you have a right to receive:
• “How long?”  You have a right to know how long we’ll keep your data. If we can’t state a hard number, then we’ll tell you the criteria that will determine when we will delete your personal data.
• “What information does SGC Dungarvan have?”  You have a right to hear what it is that we have about you. If you see anything that needs correction or that you’d like deleted, please contact us through our Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
• “I don’t consent.” If the basis for our processing is your consent, you have a right to   withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent does not affect any processing we’ve already undertaken. It also doesn’t have any effect where processing is not based on your consent.
• “I’m still unhappy…” If you think your rights have been violated, you have a right to file a complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner.
Right to correct inaccurate data, or supplement incomplete data
We will take every reasonable step to ensure the personal data we process are accurate and up to date. You have the right to inform us of an inaccuracy in data that we process and expect that we will correct it without undue delay. Likewise, if you find that the data we’re processing is incomplete considering the purposes of the processing, you have to right to submit supplementary information. Depending on the circumstances, we might have to ask for some verification of your identity. We’ll do our best to keep those questions to a minimum and to avoid asking for new personal data we don’t already have.
Right to Erasure
In many cases, you have the right to have your personal data deleted. For more information, email our Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
DATA PORTABILITY
Right to Data Portability
We understand that sometimes you’ll need to take your data with you. At your request, we’ll provide you with a transferable copy of your data or send it directly (if possible) to your designated recipient. To make this request, please get in touch with the Data Controller at gdpr@sgcdungarvan.ie
[NB: This only applies where the lawful basis was either consent or performance of a contract and processing was automated]
Right to Avoid Automated Individual Decision-Making
At SGC Dungarvan, all decisions that could affect your rights are human-made! While we use computers to help us in our work, all decisions are made by real people.
EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS
The easiest way for you to exercise the rights above is to contact our Data Controller directly via email. Let our Data Controller know, if possible, what it is that you’re looking for, and what it is that you’d like us to do. If you have multiple requests, please do make sure you state them all clearly so we can act on them all.
We instruct all our employees to identify and appropriately escalate what appear to be subject requests based on the above rights. Employees should usually escalate requests to their Managers, who will be in touch with the Data Controller. The Data Controller may or may not require the assistance of legal advice.
