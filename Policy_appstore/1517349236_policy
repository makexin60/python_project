Who am I?
My name is Winter Bagley, and I am a self taught Full Stack Developer who used to make programming tutorials on youtube before my channel got terminated for copyright because nintendo dicked down my switch modding vids rip xd. I am the dev/owner of a very popular 3rd party appstore called EonHub where you can get mods for ios without a jailbreak. My app is the first thing that comes up when you google EonHub even though itâ€™s the name of a weird magic card. I decided to buy a card shop in my town to hopefully set myself up for the future when my broken bones get arthritis or whatever because I am a cripple blah blah blah. I own Cool Finds with my sister Whimly where we sell tcgs, witchy shit, d&d, 3d prints, video games, toys, and more.
