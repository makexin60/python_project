This is the Website and App Privacy Policy (
“Privacy Policy”
) of the UK registered branch of Cookpad Inc., a corporation registered at WeWork Ocean Gate Minatomirai, 3-7-1 Yokohama-shi Nishi Ward Minatomirai, Kanagawa, Japan (
“Cookpad”
) and we are the data controller in respect of the Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect from you.  It covers information Cookpad collects from users and visitors of our official website (
“Site”
) and official mobile app (
“App”
).
When we use the terms “we”, “us” or “our” we refer to Cookpad and
“Our Group”
means entities controlling, controlled by or under common control with Cookpad. Learn more about Our Group

By accessing our Site or App, you confirm that you have read and understood the entirety of this Privacy Policy.
You have various rights in respect of our use of your Personal Information as set out in the
‘Your Rights’
section below.  Two of the fundamental rights to be aware of are that you may:
ask us to stop using your Personal Information for direct-marketing by email or push notification.  If you exercise this right, we will stop using your Personal Information in this regard; and
ask us to consider any valid objections you have to our use of your Personal Information where we process your Personal Information on the basis of our, or a third party's, legitimate interests.
2. What does this Privacy Policy cover?
We process certain information about you visit or when you use our service provided by our Site or App (“

”). Some of that information may enable you to be identifiable (“
Personal Information
”).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store and use your Personal Information when you visit or use our Site and App. It also describes the types of Personal Information we collect, how we use this Personal Information to ensure we provide a relevant and timely Cookpad Service to you, and to improve your experience of the Cookpad Service.

Uploaded thumbnails may contain information about you, such as your face; however, the image recognition functionality does not perform facial recognition or attempt to identify any individuals in images.  After thumbnails are classified, the original images of those identified as Food Photos are uploaded and stored in our server.  We automatically delete any thumbnails from our server that the image recognition functionality does not identify as a Food Photo or the original images that you manually removed.

7. Our legal grounds for processing Personal Information
We may only process your Personal Information if we have a legal basis for doing so. This section sets out the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your Personal Information.
We consider that the legal bases for using your Personal Information are as follows:
use of your Personal Information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with our Terms of Use which you accept by browsing the Site or by downloading the App);
our use of your Personal Information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations;
where neither of the above two legal bases applies, use of your Personal Information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of the Site or App). Our legitimate interests are:
to run, grow and develop our business;
to operate and secure the Site and App;
marketing, market research and business development;
to provide the Cookpad Services to our users, to provide customer and technical services and to know the users that we are providing the Cookpad Services to;
to protect our users and Our Group from fraud or harm; and
for internal group administrative purposes.
If we rely on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests for using your Personal Information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the third party’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of your Personal Information.  You can ask us for information on this balancing test by
contacting us
.
Other uses of Personal Information (including special categories of Personal Information and participation in the beta programme) may be subject to your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it).
If we rely on your consent for us to use your Personal Information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by
contacting us
and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to provide services to you.
8. Where is your Personal Information stored and processed?
We will process and store your Personal Information in the locations in which Our Group operates, and in the location of our servers. More details on the locations of Our Group can be found
here
.
We comply with applicable laws in respect of the international transfer of Personal Information.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), please note that we may transfer your Personal Information for the provision of the Cookpad Service to locations outside the European Economic Area, including USA and Japan. Some of those locations may not offer a similar level of protection to European regulations. In these cases, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These adequate safeguards include, in the case of entities based in countries outside the EEA (including Japan), entering into data transfer agreements with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data to third countries.
Further details on the steps we take to protect your Personal Information, in these transfer cases is available from us on request by
contacting us
at any time.
9. How long do we keep your Personal Information?
We will not keep your Personal Information longer than reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as prescribed by law. In particular, we will implement a retention policy which stipulates the length of time we keep Personal Information. We will securely delete the Personal Information that we no longer need, and update, archive or securely delete Personal Information if it goes out of date. Therefore, we will retain any personal data related to your account for as long as you keep it open.
We do not retain the contact information you provide about others for matching purposes after we have performed the matching.
We keep daily backups of the Site which will automatically be deleted after 60 days, and a monthly backup which will allow us to keep a record of how the Site appears each month (both of which will include Personal Information)  and which we will keep for 6 years, in each case for the purposes of maintaining the Site, and establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights.   We put measures in place to ensure that any Personal Information which is stored on our backup systems is put “beyond all reasonable use”.  That means that we cannot and will not use that Personal Information to inform any decision about you or in a manner that affects you in any way, or give any other organisation access to that Personal Information.  It also means that, when you exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Information, any Personal Information which is stored on our backup systems will not necessarily be within scope of those rights (i.e. we will not usually disclose it in response to a request for access to Personal Information, nor will we usually need to erase it should you ask us to).  Should you exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Information, we will explain – in our response – how those rights apply in relation to Personal Information which is stored in our backup systems.
The length of time we retain Personal Information for depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise of defend our legal rights.
10. How do we secure your Personal Information?
We take steps in an effort to treat your information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately though, the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure and, as such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to the Site or the App and that such transmission is at your own risk.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
11. What about the privacy of children?
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under the age of 16, and no part of the Cookpad Service is directed to children under the age of 16. If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may
alert us
. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from children under 16, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.
12. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on our Site or App. Depending on the significance of the changes, we may get in touch with you or display a more prominent notice.  If we need to, we will e-mail you with details of those changes and/or ask you to confirm that you are happy with them. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.
