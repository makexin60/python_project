A cookie contains your contact  information and information to allow us to identify your computer when you travel around our site for the purpose  of helping you accomplish your purpose. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you wish, you can  set your browser to prevent it from accepting cookies.

identifiable information.

They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see  how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.

6. Data Retention.
6.1. The length of time for which we retain your personal data depends on the type of personal data and the purposes for which we are processing it. We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the  purposes we collected it for or otherwise permitted by applicable laws. We may also retain your information during  the period of time needed to complete our legitimate business operations, including for the purposes of satisfying  any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain certain information, including cached or archived copies as necessary for legitimate business purposes.

This data processing is necessary to provide or fulfill a service requested by or for you, which is in our legitimate business interest.
6.2. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and  sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If you would like more information about our retention periods, please contact us at
privacy@learnupon.com
.
7. Consent.
7.1. Where we are relying upon your consent for the processing of your personal data, you may withdraw consent without detriment at any time by providing an unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify withdrawal of consent to the processing of personal data relating to you. If you have any queries relating to withdrawing your consent, please contact LearnUpon’s data protection manager using the contact details set out below.
7.2. Withdrawal of consent shall be without effect to the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
8. Security of your Personal Data.
8.1. We take appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data.
8.2. We have put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction. Personal data will only be transferred to a data processor if they agree to comply with those procedures and policies, or if they put in place adequate measures themself. In addition, we have appropriate written agreements in place with all our data processors.
8.3. We maintain data security by protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the personal data, defined as follows:
Confidentiality means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it
Integrity means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed.
Availability means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes.
8.4. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect it  against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. LearnUpon uses third party vendors and hosting partners to  provide the necessary hardware, software networking, storage, and related technology required to run. The data you provide to us is protected using modern encryption, intrusion prevention, and account access techniques.
9. International Transfers.
9.1. When we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure an adequate degree of protection is  afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.
9.2. We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of  protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European  Commission:
Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
9.3. Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission:
Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
9.4. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
9.1.3. We can only then process the personal data that we have collected for the purposes which we have identified or for purposes that are compatible with the purposes that we have identified.
9.1.4. The personal data that we collect and process must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes.
9.1.5. The personal data that we collect and process must be accurate and (where necessary) kept up to-date.
9.1.6. We must not keep personal data any longer than is necessary, bearing the purpose for which we collected it. This includes that we should keep personal data in a form which permits identification of the data subject for no longer than is necessary.
9.1.7. We must keep personal data safe and secure from unauthorised access, deletion, disclosure or other unauthorised uses. This includes not just keeping data safe and secure from persons outside our organisation, but also from people within our organisation who have no need to access or use the personal data. We must also be careful when transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”, being the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), and make sure that we have a valid legal basis on which to transfer that data. Transfer can include using a cloud server that is located outside the EU or allowing people who are located outside the EEA access to personal data that is stored within the EEA.
9.1.8. We must comply with data subjects’ rights of information about, and (separately) access to, their personal data and with their other data protection rights, including rights to correct or erase their personal data, rights “to be forgotten”, rights to object to processing (including profiling), rights against automated decision-making and (under the GDPR) rights to data portability.
10. Will we share your Information with anyone else?
10.1. We may disclose your information to trusted third parties for the purposes set out in Section 3. We require all third parties to have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your  personal data, in line with EU laws on data protection. Any such company or individual will have access to  personal information needed to perform these functions but may not use it for any other purpose.
10.2. Specifically, we need to have written agreements in place with all our data processors and, before we sign each agreement, we need to have vetted and be satisfied with the processor’s data security. The agreements also need to contain specific clauses that deal with data protection.
10.3. We may pass on your details if we are under a duty to disclose or share a data subject’s personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contract with the data subject or other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our employees, customers, or others. This includes reporting information about incidents (as appropriate) to the law enforcement authorities and responding to any requirements from law enforcement authorities to provide information and/or personal data to them for the  purposes of them detecting, investigating and/or prosecuting offences or in connection with crime sentencing.
10.4. We may share your personal data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
10.5. We need to demonstrate accountability for our data protection obligations. This means that we must be able to show how we comply with the data protection rules, and that we have in fact complied with the rules. We do this, among other ways, by our written policies and procedures, by building data protection compliance into our systems and business rules, by internally monitoring our data protection compliance and keeping it under review, and by taking action if our employees or contractors fail to follow the rules. We also have certain obligations in relation to keeping records about our data processing.
