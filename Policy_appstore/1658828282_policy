If you want us to permanently delete your personal information from our servers at any time, please send an email to support@gosnappy.io.

However, no security system is perfect and there is always a risk of unauthorized parties accessing your personal information. Therefore, Snappy makes no guarantees or representations as to the technical or legal compliance of its servers. We cannot guarantee the complete protection and security of your personal information.
