Effective Date: 4 February 2025
WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY
COVER?
Your privacy is
extremely important to Hatla2ee. We are committed to protecting your Personal
Data (as that term is defined further below).
We
want to be transparent with you about how we collect and use your Personal Data
in making our website and mobile applications (“
Platform
”) available
to you
and tell you about your privacy rights and
how the law protects you.
This Privacy
Policy aims to give you information on how Hatla2ee collects and processes your
Personal Data through your use of this Platform.
We will
ensure that all processing of your Personal Data is conducted in accordance
with applicable data protection laws.
By providing your Personal Data
through our Platform, you explicitly agree to the collection, use and
processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. You
acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to
the terms outlined herein.
If you do not agree to our
processing of your Personal Data, please do not provide your information or use
our Platform.
With that in
mind, this Privacy Policy covers the following:
·
WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US
·
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU
·
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES
·
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND WHY
·
WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH
·
HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE
·
HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
·
YOUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA
·
MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
·
OUR POLICY ON CHILDREN
·
THIRD PARTY LINKS
·
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, with
or without notice to you.
If that happens, the new version of this Privacy Policy will be made
available on this page.
WHO WE ARE
AND HOW TO CONTACT US
Who we are
Hatla2ee Egypt L.L.C
operates the
Platform and is therefore the controller
of your
Personal Data
(referred to as either “
Hatla2ee
”, “
we
”, “
us
”
or “
our
” in this Privacy Policy).
How to contact us
You can contact
us by emailing:
info@hatla2ee.com
.
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM
YOU
The Personal
Data we collect directly from you is outlined in the table below.
“
Personal
Data
” is information about an individual from which that individual is either
directly identified or can be identified. It does
not
include ‘
anonymised
data
’ (which is information where the identity of an individual has been
permanently removed). However, it
does
include ‘
pseudonymised data
’
(which is information which alone doesn’t identify an individual but, when
combined with additional information, could be used to identify an individual).
Category
  of Personal Data
What this means
Identity Data
First name, last name, username or similar identifier, and profile
  photo.
Contact Data
Email address, telephone number(s).
Location Data
Approximate location if you enable this feature via your device.
Listings Data
Details about your previous and current listings on the Platform,
  as well as details of other users’ listings that you have viewed, and offers
  you have made for other users’ listings.
Marketing Data
Your preferences in receiving marketing messages from us.
Chat Data
Details of messages that you exchange with other users of the
  Platform through the ‘Chat’ feature, including any additional Personal Data
  you may disclose in such messages.
Call Data
Recordings of calls between you and our teams, which are recorded
  for monitoring and training purposes.
Behavioural Data
Inferred or assumed information relating to your behaviour and
  interests based on your activity on the Platform. This is most often collated
  and grouped into ‘segments’ on an aggregated basis.
Technical Data
Internet protocol (IP) address, login data, browser type and
  version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions,
  operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to
  access this Platform or use our services.
Aggregated data
We also collect,
use and share ‘
aggregated data
’,
such as statistical or
demographic data for a number of purposes. Aggregated data may be derived from
your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form it will no longer constitute Personal
Data as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For
example, we may aggregate your Behavioural Data to calculate the percentage of
users accessing a specific Platform feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated
data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify
you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Special categories of personal data
We do not knowingly
collect any ‘
special categories of personal data
’ about you (this
includes, for example, details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
philosophical beliefs, political opinions, information about your health,
genetic and/or biometric data, and information about criminal offences and
convictions).
We advise you
not to share any of that data with us (for example, through our support chat function)
or other users of the Platform (for example, through the user-to-user chat
function). However, should you choose to share such data with us or other users
of the Platform, you consent to us processing such data in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.
What happens if you refuse to provide necessary Personal
Data?
You do not have
to provide any Personal Data to us. However, where we
need
to
process your Personal Data either to grant you access to the Platform or to comply
with applicable law, and you fail to provide that Personal Data when requested,
we may not be able to provide you access to the Platform. For example, we
need
your email address in order to register your account on the Platform.
PERSONAL DATA
WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES
In addition to the Personal Data that we collect
directly from you (as described in the section immediately above this one), we
also collect certain of your Personal Data from third party sources. These
sources are set out in the table below.

HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
AND WHY
We will only use
your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below,
unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and
that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your
Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and
we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so (please refer to the
‘Changes to this Privacy Policy’ section further below).
What is our ‘legal basis’ for processing your
Personal Data?
In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal
Data, applicable privacy laws require us to ensure that we
have a ‘
legal basis
’ for that use. Most commonly, we
will rely on one of the following legal bases:
·
Where we need to process your
Personal Data to meet our contractual obligations to you (for example, to
provide you access to the Platform) (“
Contractual Necessity
”).
·
Where we need to process your
Personal Data to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations (“
Compliance
with Law
”).
·
Where we have your consent
to process your Personal Data for a specific purpose (“
Consent
”).
We have set out below, in a table format, the
legal bases we rely on when processing your Personal Data.

WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL
DATA WITH
The table below
describes who we may share your Personal Data with and why we share it.
We require all
recipients of your Personal Data to implement appropriate security measures to
adequately protect it, consistent with our policies and any data security
obligations applicable to us. We do not permit our third-party service
providers who process your Personal Data on our behalf to use it for their own
purposes, and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified
purposes in accordance with our instructions.
Recipients
Why we share it
Other users
  of the Platform
We need to share some of your Personal Data with other users of
  the Platform when you wish to transact with them through the Platform.
By placing a listing on our Platform, that information and any
  Personal Data associated with your account profile (including your username)
  will be publicly accessible to, and may be copied and shared externally by,
  all other users of our Platform. Such information may also appear in third
  party search engine results (for example, Google search results). Please ensure
  that you are comfortable with such information being publicly available before
  submitting it on our Platform.
Service
  providers
Our service providers provide us with a range of services which
  are necessary for the operation of the Platform (for example, IT, system
  administration services, or marketing services), and may have access to your
  Personal Data as a result.
Affiliates
Hatla2ee is part of the Dubizzle Group, which operates other
  consumer platforms and share technology with Hatla2ee. Our affiliated
  companies may
require access to your Personal Data
  as they
help us operate the Platform and manage user data. We may also
  use your Personal Data to understand how you use various products operated by
  the Dubizzle Group as a whole.
Professional advisers
Our lawyers, bankers, auditors, insurers and
  other advisers may require limited access to your Personal Data when they provide
  consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services to us.
Public authorities
Public authorities may require us to disclose
  user data to them under certain circumstances, where required by law (for
  example, in the event of a police investigation).
Acquirer(s)
We may share your Personal Data with third
  parties in the event of any reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture,
  assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our
  business, so that any potential acquirer(s) may continue operating the
  Platform. Where that is the case, we will ensure that any such recipient(s)
  continue to use your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Data transfers
We may transfer your Personal Data to jurisdictions outside of Egypt
that may not provide the same level of data protection as is available in your
home country. Such transfers will only occur when necessary for the purposes
set out in this Privacy Policy. In all cases, we will ensure that any
cross-border transfers of your Personal Data comply with the requirements set
forth in applicable data protection laws, including implementing appropriate
safeguards to protect your data.
HOW WE KEEP
YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE
We have put in
place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being
accidentally lost or altered or used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
We limit access
to your Personal Data to those employees and other staff who have a business
need to have such access. All such persons are subject to a contractual duty of
confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any actual or suspected
Personal Data breach. In the event of any such breach, we have systems in place
to mitigate any impact to your privacy and to work with relevant regulators.
In order to
help maintain the security of your information, you should protect the
confidentiality of your username and password.
HOW LONG WE
STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as we reasonably need
to use it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer
retention period is required by applicable law (for example, for regulatory
purposes).
Under some circumstances, we may anonymise your Personal Data so
that it can no longer be associated with you. We may retain such anonymised
data indefinitely.
Our data retention policies are reviewed at regular intervals and
comply with all applicable requirements.
YOUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO
YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Your rights
Under some
circumstances, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data.

·
Request access to your Personal Data
. This allows you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold
about you, and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
·
Request the correction of your Personal Data
. This allows you to ask for any incomplete or inaccurate
information we hold about you to be corrected.
·
Request the erasure of your Personal Data
. This allows you to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data from
our systems where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it.

where we are
relying on your Consent to process your Personal Data. If you withdraw your Consent,
we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain features of our

Please note that
not all of the rights listed above may be available to you, and some rights may
only be exercisable in specific circumstances.

If
you
want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us.
We may need to
request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your
other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Data is
not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact
you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
our response.
We try to
respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt. Occasionally,
it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if
you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep
you updated.

typically not charge a fee for exercising your rights
described
above
, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee in some
circumstances (for example, if your request is unreasonable or if you submit an
excessive number of requests).

like to make a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in
relation to your Personal Data, please contact us. We will reply to your
