Personal information (e.g. name, telephone number, e-mail address, postal address)
·
Contract master data (e.g. contract relationship, product or contract interests)
·
Customer history

Other: Charging process data (e.g. amount of energy, charging duration, charging station used), charging identification data (user, vehicle)
3.2
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as their name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, contract, ordering and billing data which identifies a specific person. We will collect, process and use personal data (including IP addresses) only when we have legal grounds for doing so, or when you have given us your consent to do so, such as by registering with us.
4
Purposes of processing data and legal grounds
4.1
We, and service providers engaged by us, will process your personal data for the following purposes
:
-
User account: In order to be able to use the "Bosch Charging Services" and to invoice accordingly, a user account is required. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Location of and navigation to charging points: In order to indicate charging points in your vicinity and enable you to navigate to them, we need your location data (GPS). You can specify in your cell phone's system settings whether to allow the "Charge My EV" app to use location data. If you do not allow the "Charge My EV" app to use location data in your cell phone's system settings, we will indicate charging points to you, but they might not be in your immediate vicinity. We will then also not be able help you navigate to charging points. There is no live tracking of your position happening. We only receive your current position at the moment of your query to show you charge points nearby. We do not store this location information.
(Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Performance of charging process: It is necessary to process data in order to perform a charging process. This applies in particular for the authentication at the charging station. You can use various access media (such as an app or Charging App, RFID card or vehicle for Plug and Charge) to start and stop charging. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
In order to enable the charging process at a specific charging station, the exchange of (pseudonymous) data between us and the respective Charge Point Operator (CPO) is necessary. To provide a comprehensive service, it is necessary to cooperate with a large number of CPOs and perform the associated data processing. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Monitoring of charging facilities: To safeguard our charging service, we will also monitor your charging operations.
(Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Order and Shipment of RFID cards: If you decide to order an RFID card for access to charging stations, the RFID card will be shipped to the address you provide us. For this purpose, your personal information will be processed. (Legal grounds: Fulfillment of the contract)
-
Log: Running and completed charging operations will be recorded in the log of the "Charge My EV" app. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Payment processing: You can select a payment service provider to pay for charging facilities which you use through the "Charge My EV" app. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Create favorites: In order to quickly and easily find your preferred charging points again, you can add them to a list of favorites. In this context, we save the corresponding charging point information in your user profile. You can remove favorite charging points at any time. (Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Support: As part of our user support services, we will collect your data in order to help resolve any problems you may have. This also includes logging your activities within the "Bosch Charging Services" application.
(Legal grounds: Contract fulfillment)
-
Rating of charging points: Within the "Charge My EV" app, you can rate individual charging points by criteria including functionality, accessibility and price, and submit your feedback to us. (Legal grounds: Justified interest in improving our service quality)
4.2
Duration of storage; retention periods:
As a rule, we will store your data for as long as necessary to deliver our services linked to your use of the "Charge My EV" app and related ancillary services, and for as long as we have a justified interest in storing the said data further (for example, we may have a justified interest in carrying out postal marketing campaigns after having fulfilled a contract). In all other cases, we will delete your personal data, with the exception of data which we are required to continue holding in order to comply with legal obligations (for example, retention periods stipulated under tax and commercial law require us to keep documents such as contracts and invoices for a certain period of time).
5
Forwarding of data
5.1
Forwarding of data to other responsible parties
We will only forward your personal data to other responsible parties to the extent necessary in fulfillment of the contract, to the extent that we or the said third party have a justified interest in forwarding it, or to the extent that you have given your consent for us to do so. Details of the legal grounds for such forwarding are set out in the section headed "Purposes of processing data and legal grounds". Third parties may also be other companies of the Bosch Group. The cases in which data is forwarded to third parties on the basis of a justified interest are explained in this data protection notice.
Other responsible Party:
Charge Point Operators (CPOs):
See 4.1 (Performing of charging process).
In general, further information and contact details of the CPO can be found on the respective charging station used.
Additionally, data may be forwarded to other responsible parties where we are obligated to do so in compliance with the law or pursuant to enforceable orders of a public agency or judgments of a court.
5.2
Service providers (general)
We engage external service providers to perform services including sales and marketing, contract management, payment processing, programming, data hosting, and hotline operations. We have selected the said service providers carefully, and monitor them on a regular basis, particularly with regard to their due diligence in handling and protecting your stored data. We obligate all our service providers to maintain confidentiality and to comply with all legal requirements. Service providers may also be other companies of the Bosch Group.
5.3
Payment service providers:
We use external payment service providers. Depending on which payment method you choose during the ordering process, we will forward the data connected to the processing of payments (e.g. bank details or credit card data) to the bank contracted to make the payment or to payment service providers engaged by us. In some cases, the payment service providers will also collect and process the said data as responsible parties. In such cases, the data protection notices issued by the payment service providers in question shall apply.
6
Data transfer by operators of app stores
The transfer of data such as a user name, e-mail address or individual device ID to the app store when downloading the "Charge My EV" app shall not be classed as data collection by us, and is beyond our control. We have no influence on that data collection, or on the further processing of data by the app store as the responsible party.
7
Use of external links
The "Charge My EV" app may contain links to websites of third-party vendors who are not connected to us. After you click on such a link, we have no further influence on the collection, processing or use of any personal data transmitted to the third party in question by clicking on the said link (such as your IP address or the URL of the page containing the link), as the actions of third parties are inevitably beyond our control. Bosch accepts no responsibility for the processing of such personal data by third parties.
8
Security
8.1
Our employees and the employees of service companies engaged by us are bound to secrecy and to adhere to the provisions of the application data protection laws.
8.2
We will implement all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure appropriate levels of security, and to protect the data you entrust to us, in particular against the risk of unintentional or illegal destruction, manipulation, loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. Our security measures are constantly being improved to keep pace with technological developments.
9
User rights
9.1
Your rights as a user are detailed in this section. Please use any of the methods in the Contact section when asserting your rights. When doing so, please ensure that we are able to identify you uniquely.
9.2
Rights of notification and disclosure of information: You have the right to receive information from us concerning the processing of your data. To do so, you can assert your right to disclosure of information in relation to your personal data which we process.
9.3
Rights of correction and deletion: You can demand that we correct incorrect data and - provided that legal requirements are met - add to or delete your data as appropriate.
This does not apply to data required for billing and accounting purposes, or to data subject to statutory retention periods. To the extent that access to such data is not required, however, the processing of it will be restricted (see below).
We offer you the possibility to delete your user account irrevocably directly in the app. To do so, select the "Delete account" function in your profile. With your confirmation, your personal data will be permanently deleted within one month.
9.4

9.6
Objections to direct marketing: You can also object to the processing of your personal data by us for promotional and advertising purposes at any time. Please note that, for organizational reasons, there may be overlaps between your objection and the use of your data as part of an ongoing campaign.
9.7
Objections to processing of data where "justified interest" is cited as legal grounds:
You also have the right to object to the processing of your data by us at any time where the said processing is based on the legal grounds of justified interest. We will then cease processing your data, unless we are able to prove the existence of pressing reasons for further processing of it which are deemed worthy of protection and which outweigh your own rights according to the law.
9.8
Revoking of consent:
Where you have given us your consent to process your data, you can revoke it at any time, effective for the future. The legality of the processing of your data shall remain unaffected up to the point of revocation.
9.9
Data portability: You further have the right to receive data which you have made available to us returned to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to demand - where technically feasible - that the data be transmitted to a third party.
9.10
Right of complaint to the regulatory authority: You have the right to submit a complaint to a data protection authority. You can submit complaints to the data protection authority whose jurisdiction covers your place of residence or federal state, or to the data protection supervisory authority to which we answer.
