We collect data about you directly through the Services, automatically through cookies and other technologies when you visit the Services, and sometimes from third parties. Some of the data we collect may be considered “personal data” (sometimes also referred to as “personal information”) and some may be considered “sensitive,” under applicable laws. We will also treat other information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal data” where required by applicable law.
Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize your personal data so as to make it non-personal, either by combining it with data about other individuals and/or by hashing the data or otherwise removing characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. If we combine non-personal data with personal data, then we will treat the combined information as personal data under this Privacy Policy. We may share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and marketing purposes.
The following list sets out the personal data collected by category (
“Category”

Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as web beacons or pixel tags or 1x1 GIFs or clear GIFs) may be included in our web pages and email messages. These and similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate Services, to count how many of our email messages were opened, or to count how many particular products were viewed. The information we collect through this technology may include the first date and time you open our email, and whether you click any links included in our email.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
Software Development Kits (SDKs).  These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.
Data Collection from Mobile Devices. We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in SDKs to collect information from mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.

Data You Provide Directly.
Live Chat Features. When you participate in our chat features, such as Chegg Support sessions or an AI assisted feature, we can record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of providing you the Services and allowing you to participate in the feature, assisting you during the conversation, providing related support for your account, subscription, or services, and to improve the Services. If you do not consent, please do not continue with chat features.
Video Call Recording. If you use our Skills Service, we may record video calls between instructors and students, for example one-to-one meetings between instructors and students and class instruction sessions for quality assurance and security purposes. If we record such a call, notice will be provided to you within the video call tool.
Photos and Videos.   We allow you to post photos and videos on the Services or to submit them to us as described above.  Applicable laws and regulations may vary with respect to whether such materials are considered to be biometric information.  For clarity, Chegg does not create a record of facial geometry from your photos or videos, and does not use your photos or videos for the purposes of facial recognition, facial surveillance, or otherwise as a biometric identifier.  Please note, however, that to the extent that you post your photos or videos publicly on our Services, or we share – as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy – such materials with third parties who are permitted to use these materials in accordance with their own privacy policies, we do not control the actions of third parties, and their use of your photos or videos may differ from ours.
Employment Applications.

Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties
Referral Features. We may make available referral functions that permit you to send invitations, content, or other information directly to a third party through the Services. If you send a communication using such functionality, the information you provide about the recipient (e.g., name and e-mail address) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. Any information you provide in connection with sending the message, (e.g., your name and your email address) will, of course, be disclosed to the recipient.

In the case of phone numbers collected through our SMS/MMS/text message programs, we will only share this information with third parties that help provide the SMS/MMS/text messaging service for us (including, but not limited to, platform providers, phone companies, and other vendors). Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.  If you decide that you do not want to receive communications from a third party, or have questions about their privacy practices, you will need to contact that third party directly.

In addition, the Services may allow you to communicate and collaborate with each other, including via video chat or text chat.

We do not control the actions of third parties and you post content and share your information at your own risk.
Third Party Offers/Bundled Products. We may offer through the Services the services of a third party, or we may offer our Services to you through a third party. In those instances, by signing up for the third party service or signing up for our Services through a third party, you are agreeing and directing us, to disclose your information to that third party (or parties), and your information will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. This includes, without limitation, instances in which you use our Services to purchase products or services provided, in whole or part, by third parties. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or social media feature, that we share information about you with a third party or publicly.
Disclosures During Business Transfers.  In the event  Chegg goes through a business transition, Chegg reserves the right to disclose and transfer all personal information related to the Services (including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process): (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy, the sale of certain of Chegg’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other company change. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent, except where required by law.
Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may share information with third-party service providers or allow those third parties to collect information about you, to enable them to perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, conducting website usage analytics, sending email, text, or other communications, fulfilling orders, providing marketing assistance and data analysis, processing payments, and other services. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions.
Social Media and Other Third Party Platforms. We may host or facilitate interactions with social media or other third party platforms, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and LinkedIn, including the use of their login service. When you interact with these third party platforms through the Services, we will receive information about you from the third party platform service and you will be choosing to share information about your interactions with Chegg with that social media service.
In addition, the third party platform service may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of the Services, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on the Services. These third party platforms may be able to collect certain information on your visits to the Services regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the third party platform. If you are logged out or do not have an account and visit a page with a social plug-in, your browser sends a more limited set of information. Like other sites, the third party platform will receive information about the webpage you are visiting, the date and time of your visit, and other browser-related information. They may use that information to help them improve their products or for other purposes set forth in their privacy policy. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or "friends."
The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but may retain the information previously collected.
If you choose to post information to a third-party platform, that information may be public.
3. Third Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls/Do-Not-Track
Chegg works with third party business partners, including online advertising companies, ad agencies, and analytics providers to serve Chegg ads online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (like cookies and web tags) on your device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Information and other information about you, some of which may be personal data or personal information under various state laws. Some of these parties may collect personal data over time when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. We may share information, typically information that has been aggregated or de-identified, pseudonymized, Device ID/Information, and location information with third party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other third parties, including for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads on and off the Services.
If you would like to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, there are a variety of tools available to you:
Our Cookie Opt-Out Tools.
To opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (targeted advertising) via cookies, use the tool available in footer of this webpage. Note that you will need to do this on each of our Services for which you would like to exercise this opt-out right. To opt out of other forms of processing of your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, please complete this form. If you are a California resident, please see our NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS regarding additional rights you have, including how to exercise your “Do Not Sell” and “Do Not Share” rights.
Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals offered by some web browsers are settings that request that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and set up Do Not Track here.
Global Privacy Controls.
Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. You can find out more about and set up GPC here.
NAI/DAA Opt-Out.
Some of the companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI provides information regarding targeted advertising and the opt-out procedures of NAI members, including opt-out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit the DAA's website, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for DAA-participating companies.
Mobile Device/AppChoices.
Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register at AppChoices for their intent not to receive targeted advertising.
Google Analytics/Adobe Analytics.
We use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services report on activities and trends. These services may also collect information about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can learn about Google's practices, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. Learn about Adobe's practices here.
Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and that you will continue to receive generic ads while online. Your opt-out choices are browser and device specific; if you disable your cookies, upgrade your browser after opting out or if you use multiple different devices, please opt-out on each device and each browser separately.

11. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This California Privacy Notice sets forth the disclosures and rights for California Consumers regarding their Personal Information, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder. Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings given in the CCPA and CPRA and the associated regulations, unless otherwise defined.
EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS
California Consumers have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you ("Right to Know"); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we collect about you ("Right to Delete"); (3) that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you (“Right to Correct”), (4) to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising) (“Right to Opt-Out of Sharing”), (5) to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Opt-Out of Sale”), and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information to purposes set forth in the statute, including that use which is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services (“Right to Limit The Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information”), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.
In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it. We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.
Verifying Your Requests
We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making.
When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond your full name, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request. Pursuant to the CPRA, we will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise your Right to Opt-Out of Sharing, Right to Opt-Out of Sale, or Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.
Agents
If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user’s behalf, please email your request to
privacy@chegg.com
per the instructions below. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may, but are not required, to submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.
Right to Know
California Consumers have the right to know what information we have collected about you (the categories and the specific pieces of information).
If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please submit your request here.
In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
Right to Delete
California Consumers have the right to request that we delete information we have collected from you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please submit your request here.
Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.
Right to Correct Inaccurate Information
California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you. If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Correct, please submit your request here.
Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information
As disclosed in the chart below, we may collect certain information which is considered Sensitive Personal Information under California law. This includes race and gender identity. Under the CPRA Regulations, a business must provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information only when its use does not fall within the list of exceptions outlined in Sec. 7027(m). Chegg’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information falls within this list of exemptions and we therefore do not offer an opt-out right at this time.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising
California Consumers have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information. Chegg does not sell Personal Information for monetary compensation.
California Consumers also have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising), whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration. If you are a California Consumer and would like exercise your Right to Opt-Out of “Sales” or “Sharing” for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising, please submit your request here.
Cookie-Based Opt-Outs for Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising
Chegg engages in online advertising practices (and certain analytics or similar activities), which may be considered a “sale” or “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising under the CCPA and CPRA. To opt out of cookies set by 3rd parties that may be considered "sales" or “sharing” under the CCPA and CPRA, please use the footer titled: “DO NOT SELL MY INFO” at the bottom of this webpage.
In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA and CPRA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies. For more information, please visit:
https://www.privacyrights.info/.
Data Retention
We will retain all categories of personal information described in this California Privacy Notice for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this California Privacy Notice, considering the time period reasonably necessary to: provide our Services to you; fulfill and honor the choices and rights you have requested; comply with our contractual obligations; enforce our Terms of Use for the Services; and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Except as noted differently within our Services, we retain your personal information while you have an account with us, or while you are using our Services or continuing to visit us.
Notice of Financial Incentive
Under California regulation, certain aspects of our programs, which provide benefits to consumers, may be considered a financial incentive program. We collect personal information from you, such as your contact information (e.g., phone number or email address) to provide the benefits to you, to better serve you, and to fulfill your requests associated with the program.  To opt into the programs, you may need to provide certain information and agree to applicable program terms.  Please see the terms of the program you are joining for additional description of the program and any additional requirements.  Participation in these programs is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time.  To the extent that we provide programs that may be considered a financial incentive because the program is directly or reasonably related to the collection, deletion or retention of consumer personal information, the value is reasonably related to the overall value we receive from the personal information participants provide specific to the program minus the costs and expenses we incur in providing the program.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA and CPRA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA and CPRA rights.

Other California Rights
California residents have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Chegg does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. Chegg will provide you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Chegg offers that choice, we will not share your personal information with that third party for its direct marketing purposes.
