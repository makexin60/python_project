We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy or the way we use, share or collect Personal Information, we will notify you by revising the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy, prominently posting an announcement of the changes on our Services, or by sending you a written communication using the contact information you provided us prior to the new policy taking effect.

​
Information we get from you
When you use our Services, we collect information that you provide to us. Additionally, certain information is automatically collected from you. Some of this information may identify you (“Personal Information”), and some of this information may not identify you (“Anonymous Information”). Sometimes, Anonymous Information may directly or indirectly be associated or combined with Personal information. In these cases, such Anonymous Information will be considered Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. In addition, to the extent that Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses or similar identifiers or information are considered personally identifiable information by applicable law, we will treat those items as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
​
Information You Provide to Us
Information you may provide includes your name, email, mobile number, Apple username, birth date, place of birth, and time of birth, and login name. If you apply for a position with us, you may provide us information about your work history, work authorization status, education, skills, professional licenses, permits or certifications, and references, as well as information in any documents you may choose to provide, such as a CV, resume or cover letter, and any other information you choose to provide to us. If you purchase our Services or products, you may provide your credit or debit card information. Starcrossed uses third parties to process payments – we do not collect or store credit card information.
​
If you provide your phone number, we send a few kinds of transactional text messages directly relating to your use of your Services, like confirming your account and resetting your password. By providing your mobile phone number, you expressly consent to receive this type of transactional text messages from us at that number. Third-party data and message fees may apply.
​
Information Collected Automatically From Devices
When you access our Services, we may automatically collect information that is linked to your computer, phone, or other device, including information related to your behavior and activity while interacting with us, such as your IP address, operating system and version, local time zone, date, time, and activity of your request, device type (e.g. desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, etc.), device manufacturer, screen size, and language preference.
Consistent with most websites, we use cookies and pixel tags. Cookies are small text files used to collect information and pixels are transparent images that allow us to understand how users interact with our Websites. The Websites use necessary cookies and analytics cookies.
​
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We employ technology to recognize and respect DNT preferences that you set in your web browser.
​
How we use information
In general, we use the information we collect to provide you with the best possible Services, and continually improve them over time.
​

Additionally, we may use your personal information if we think we need to or are permitted to for legal purposes, to protect our business, our rights, or our property, or to address activity that may be illegal, unethical, or legally actionable.
​
How we share information
Starcrossed does not sell your personal information to third parties, nor do we disclose personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
​
We may share Anonymous Information with third parties as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and to improve our Services and for other commercial purposes.
​
We take your privacy seriously, and may disclose Personal Information only as follows:
​
To Authorized Business Partners. Authorized Business Partners are third parties whose services Starcrossed uses to operate and improve our own Services. These third parties include agents, contractors, vendors, system integrators, etc. Starcrossed, our affiliates, and our business partners may share this Personal Information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our Services.
To customer support employees. Authorized customer support employees may access to your Personal Information as needed to resolve issues you encounter on our Services and help you use our Services.
We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.
investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.
protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.
detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If Starcrossed gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.
​
WE DO NOT SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION
We have never sold your Personal Information, and we will not sell your Personal Information to third parties for their use without your consent.
​
Protecting Children's Privacy
Children Online Protection
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are not thirteen (13) years or older, do not use our Website, Apps, or Services. If you believe that we have received the information of a child, please contact us at
greyson@starcrossedapp.com
​
Erasure Law
In accordance with California law, minors under the age of eighteen (18) residing in California may remove, or request and obtain the removal of, content and information that they share on the Websites or App. To remove or to request and obtain the removal of such content and information, the user must email
greyson@starcrossedapp.com
. Users should be aware that removing content and information posted by a minor does not ensure complete or comprehensive erasure of content or information posted on our Services.
​
Under certain circumstances, Starcrossed may not have to comply with the above removal requirements. Starcrossed also reserves the right, to the extent permitted by law, to anonymize the posted content or information or to make such content or information invisible to other users and the public, instead of removing or deleting the content or information.
​
Links to third-party websites
When you use our Services, you may be directed to other websites and applications that are beyond our control. We may also allow third-party websites or applications to link to the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked websites and applications, but we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties, websites, and applications. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Services.
​
Social Media Features
Information You Share Socially
Keep in mind that the users who view any content you share (e.g. your profile or your DMs) can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Starcrossed as well: Don’t share or make public any content that you wouldn’t want someone else to save or share.
​
How we secure, store, and retain information
Security
We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational precautions to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personal information from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, or unauthorized access. We cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to us over the internet.
​
Storage
The Personal Information that you provide to us is generally stored on servers maintained by AWS, or Amazon Web Services. These servers are located in the United States. If you are located in another jurisdiction, you should be aware that once your Personal Information is submitted through our Services, it will be transferred to our servers in the United States and therefore governed by local data protection laws, which can vary state by state.
​
Retention
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
​
International users
Starcrossed is headquartered in the United States, and we store personal information on servers located in the United States, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. If you are using our Services from outside the United States or Canada, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and Canada. By using our Services, you consent to such transfers of this information.
​
We may act as a “controller” as defined under applicable data protection law when we process your information from the Website, Apps, and Services. Generally, we rely on our legitimate interests when processing this information. These legitimate interests include providing our Services, operating our Website and Apps, and our other business purposes. We also may process your personal information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you. If consent is the legal basis, we will obtain your consent and let you know how you can withdraw it.
​

​
You may opt out of email communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link within any message that you receive.
​

If you reside or are in certain jurisdictions, you may have rights and protections in relation to your information under applicable laws. These rights may include the right to access, delete, correct, move (or port), object to the processing and limit the processing of your information as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a regulator. These rights are not absolute, are subject to exceptions, and we may be required or permitted by law to decline your request. To the extent required and permitted by applicable laws, we will process your request, and if applicable, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.
