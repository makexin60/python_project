Use of Cookies
The Weather Captain website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
        online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
        disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
        deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie
        to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
        to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
        you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Surf
        Captain pages, or register with Surf Captain site or services, a cookie
        helps Surf Captain to recall your specific information on subsequent
        visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
        information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
        When you return to the same Surf Captain website, the information you
        previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Surf
        Captain features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
        of the Surf Captain services or websites you visit.

        not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites.
        We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read
        the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally
        identifiable information.
Security of your Personal Information
Surf Captain secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
        use, or disclosure. Surf Captain uses the following methods for this
        purpose:
SSL Protocol
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to
        other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
        Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
        unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information.
        Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
        network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
        to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are
        security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond
        our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all
        information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot

            requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our
            ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract
            between you and us;

Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical
            research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable

            to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such
