NOTICE TO EUROPEAN UNION DATA SUBJECTS – GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
This Section 11 (Notice to European Union Data Subject – General Data Protection Regulation) applies specifically to European Union data subjects. For the purpose of this section, terms used but not defined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the General Data Protection Regulation.
11.1.
Data Subject Rights
: You have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information where and to the extent they apply to your particular processing:
The right to request a copy of your Personal Information which the Eturi holds about you;
The right to request that the Eturi corrects any Personal Information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date;
The right to request your Personal Information is erased where it is no longer necessary for the Eturi to retain such data;
The right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Information at any time;
The right to request that the Eturi provide you with your Personal Information and where possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller (where applicable);
The right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or processing of your Personal Information, to request a restriction is placed on further processing; and
The right to lodge a complaint with a European Union Data Protection or Supervisory Authority.
11.2.
Exercise of Data Subject Rights
: You may let us know of your desire to enforce any of the rights described in this Privacy Policy by sending an email to
dataprotection@ourpact.com
, and we will respond within the time required by applicable. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. Please also note that laws and contractual frameworks limit your exercise of these data rights; we welcome you to ask us questions any time, and we will answer them as described above.
11.3.
Right to Withdraw Consent to Processing
: Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your Personal Information by the Eturi you may withdraw your consent at any time by sending a communication to the Eturi specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your Personal Information, in particular where:
you contest the accuracy of your Personal Information;
the processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information;
we no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
you have objected to the processing and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Eturi override your own.
11.4.
Complaints to Supervisory Authorities
: We invite you to let us know about any and all issues regarding our data processing activities or this Privacy Policy, and we will respond to you within 30 days of receipt of such notification. If you consider that our processing of your Personal Information infringes European Union data protection laws, in particular if you are an EU resident, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. For example, in the United Kingdom this is the Information Commissioner’s Office, and in Ireland this is the Data Protection Commissioner.
