+Background on the LibreView Data Management System
The LibreView Data Management System is a cloud-based diabetes management system that may be used by
                    individuals, healthcare professionals and Abbott to aid in the review, analysis and evaluation of
                    historical glucose data, glucose test results, ketone test results, data from connected devices and user-entered information
                    including insulin, food, exercise, and notes to support an effective diabetes health management
                    program. The LibreView Data Management System allows Abbott to provide improved guidance for
                    patients utilizing Abbott’s readers and mobile apps. It also enables Abbott to improve quality,
                    security and effectiveness of medical devices and systems and allows Abbott to develop innovative
                    and effective treatment for and management of diabetes in the interests of public health.
Please be aware that third parties may offer products, services, software, hardware (such as glucose
                    meters or attachments to an Abbott sensor) and mobile apps not authorized by Abbott and which they
                    claim may be compatible with your sensor, the FreeStyle App, and/or the LibreView Data Management
                    System. The use of such unauthorized third-party products, services, software, apps, or hardware may
                    result in the off label and unauthorized use of Abbott’s products. Abbott does not recommend or
                    endorse using the LibreView Data Management System with these third-party products and services, and
                    is not responsible if you do, including but not limited to where your use of such products or
                    services affect the integrity or accuracy of the information in your LibreView Data Management
                    System account. Abbott is not responsible if you connect with these third-party products or
                    services, or your decision to upload data from these third-party products or services to your
                    LibreView Data Management System account, or to share data from your LibreView Data Management
                    System account with these third-party products or services. If you do use these third-party products
                    or services, your use is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of use. When you do
                    use such third-party products, services, software or apps and upload information into your LibreView
                    Data Management System account, Abbott will receive and process such data, including if you have
                    uploaded health-related information. For information about how Abbott allows you to share your
                    information with authorized third parties, please see
+Disclosure of Personal Information
for more information.
Use of the LibreView Data Management System may require compatible devices, internet access, data
                    usage (charges
                    may apply), certain software (charges may apply), and periodic updates, and the performance of the
                    LibreView
                    Data Management System may be affected by these requirements.
Your health care provider also has the ability to create their own LibreView Data Management System
                    account and to create patient profiles within that account. When you visit your health care
                    provider, they can connect your reader to their LibreView Data Management System account to view and
                    print out patient reports and to remotely view patient reports and share those reports with other
                    professionals in their practice. The LibreView Data Management System allows patient users to create
                    their own accounts, upload their own information and share information with professional users. This
                    allows professional users to remotely view patient reports and share those reports with other
                    professionals in their practice. Your health care provider may also use the LibreView Data
                    Management System to send patient reports directly to their electronic medical record systems where
                    permitted, such as in the United States, or where you opt-in or otherwise consent to this data
                    sharing if you are in a country that requires such opt-in or consent.
You can choose to use the FreeStyle App without creating an account (only in the countries where it
                    is applicable), and if you do have an account you can choose to sign out at any time. If you do not
                    create an account, or you sign out of your account, the functionality of the FreeStyle App will be
                    limited. You will not be able to share your information with family members, friends or caregivers
                    by inviting them to use the LibreLinkUp App; your glucose values and other information will not be
                    backed up and stored in LibreView for you to review historical data; and you will not be able to
                    share your information with your health care provider through LibreView. All of your personal
                    information and glucose values will only be stored locally on your mobile device. If you sign out of
                    your account, you can sign back into the FreeStyle App with the same account at any time to resume
                    full functionality, to store and back up data and to share your information with family, friends or
                    caregivers. For information about what personal information we process when you do not create a
                    LibreView Data Management System account, please see

When you sign up for a LibreView Data Management System account, your account profile information is
                    kept in a separate database that does not include your health-related information, and Abbott uses
                    technical and administrative measures to ensure data separation. Please note that your name and
                    glucose data will be combined when you use the share functionality to share a report of your glucose
                    data with your health care provider or any other third party and where, in the United States, your
                    health care provider requests that the LibreView Data Management System send a report of your
                    glucose data directly to their electronic medical record system, or where you are in a country that
                    requires opt-in or consent for you to share your LibreView Data Management System, and you elect to
                    connect your account to your health care provider’s electronic medical records system, as set out in

                                    Use
for more information) and to perform broader analysis to detect systemic
                            issues;
to help us analyze the performance of the FreeStyle App (regardless of whether or not you
                            are signed into your LibreView Data Management System account on the FreeStyle App). Abbott
                            uses Google’s Firebase Analytics to collect performance monitoring data for the FreeStyle
                            App in an aggregated and de-identified format. The performance monitoring data may include
                            app version, country, OS level, device, radio and carrier information. It will not include
                            your sensor serial number nor any other personal information including health-related
                            information; and

                            alarms, log-in and event data, purchase information from our FreeStyle Libre webshops,
                            statistical information about the number of calls you make to our customer services and
                            statistical information about educational and marketing-related communications that we send
                            you, and use this combined information to:
give you personalized services by providing you with information that is relevant to
                                    you. For example, if you are using a reader, we may send you information that is
                                    relevant to the use of a reader or to send you timely messages to enable you to use
                                    the LibreView Data Management System more effectively;
better understand you and improve our interactions with you. For example, we may
                                    connect your call or text for support to your recent purchase on our webshop, which
                                    would enable us to help you during your call;
understand your preferences, to improve our interactions with you and to provide you
                                    with relevant content, products and promotions that are of interest to you. For
                                    example, if you are a new user of our products or have downloaded a new version of
                                    the FreeStyle App, we can send you educational materials that are relevant to you as
                                    a new user; and
to gain insights into and learn about the preferences and behaviors of our
                                    customers, after aggregating, anonymizing or de-identifying your personal
                                    information.

for more information).
+Medical Devices and other Legal Requirements
Abbott may use personal information, including health-related information, where legally required
                    and, where possible, we will de-identify, pseudonymize, aggregate and/or anonymize information to
                    comply with various legal requirements. For example, as a medical device manufacturer, Abbott has
                    certain legal obligations to help ensure the ongoing safety of our medical devices. This may require
                    Abbott to share personal information with regulatory authorities responsible for the quality and
                    safety of medical devices (e.g. where your health care provider reports an adverse incident to us
                    relating to an Abbott device). The information Abbott may be required to share is not used to
                    identify you individually by your name or email address, except where there is a legal obligation to
                    include this information, such as when a health care provider makes a complaint or reports an
                    adverse incident. Our parent company, Abbott Laboratories, assists us as a processor to ensure such
                    information does not identify a patient by de-identifying, pseudonymizing, aggregating and/or
                    anonymizing personal information.
The legal requirements for which Abbott may use this information include:
ensuring the ongoing safety of a device and any future development;
monitoring and improving the quality, security and effectiveness of medical devices and systems;
validating upgrades, and keeping the LibreView Data Management System safe and secure;
performing broader analysis to detect systemic issues for public interest in the area of public
                        health;
identifying options to improve the usability, performance and safety of the LibreView Data
                        Management System;
testing and evaluating the LibreView Data Management System to improve product features and
                        functionality; and
where required by law, responding to requests from any competent law enforcement body,
                        regulatory or government agency, court or other third party where we believe the disclosure is
                        necessary or appropriate to comply with a regulatory requirement, judicial proceeding, court
                        order, government request or legal process served on us, or to protect the safety, rights, or
                        property of our customers, the public, Abbott or others, and to exercise, establish or defend
                        Abbott’s legal rights or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
                        action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
                        the safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Notice, or as evidence in litigation in
                        which we are involved.
We use the terms ‘de-identify’ and ‘pseudonymize’ interchangeably. The US Health Insurance
                    Portability and Accountability Act and its implementing regulations (HIPAA) describe de-identified
                    information as information where
‘there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information
                        can be used to identify an individual’
. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)
                    (GDPR) defines ‘pseudonymization’ as
‘the processing of personal data in such a manner that the
                        personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of
                        additional information’
. Anonymized data is information that does not relate to a person and
                    from which a person cannot be identified, and this kind of data is not subject to data protection
                    and privacy laws.

+Research
Abbott conducts research for limited purposes using your personal information after it has been
                    de-identified, pseudonymized, aggregated and/or anonymized. Such data includes limited demographic
                    data, namely, year of birth and country of residence, and device related data (such as the frequency
                    and days of sensor scans or usage, frequency of use of readers, glucose target ranges, average
                    glucose values, insulin, mealtime patterns, logged exercise and other logged notes, and
                    information generated by a sensor, namely, sensor started and ended information, Bluetooth
                    connection and disconnection (where it is applicable), information about whether glucose information
                    you upload into the LibreView Data Management System has been viewed by you). This information may also include data received from your third party connected devices or apps as well as your responses to research surveys. Our parent company Abbott Laboratories in the United States assists us,
                    as a processor, to de-identify, pseudonymize, aggregate and/or anonymize your personal information.
                    Where data has been anonymized, it is no longer subject to privacy and data protection laws.
A data set processed for research purposes will not include your name, address, phone number or
                    email address. This de-identified, pseudonymized, anonymized or aggregated data set is securely held
                    by Abbott and will not be used to identify you individually by your name or email address. If you
                    delete your account through the settings in the LibreView Data Management System or through a
                    request to Customer Service, the data that has already been or is in the process of being
                    anonymized, de-identified, pseudonymized and/or aggregated for research purposes as described in
                    this section will not be deleted. The research purposes for which Abbott may use this data set
                    include:
to create, access, retain, use and share information with affiliated companies and third-party
                        researchers, health care entities or professionals or public health authorities for the purposes
                        of advancing scientific research through statistical and other analysis;
to evaluate how the LibreView Data Management System is provided and used and its effectiveness,
                        including its performance or impact on users (including base user demographics, such as
                        geography) based on real-world evidence and observational studies;
to research, develop and test health care systems and management; and
to research, develop and test medical devices, including new and existing features and
                        functionality for product development, and advancing scientific research through statistical and
                        other analysis and surveys.
Abbott conducts product usage research based on de-identified, pseudonymized, aggregated and/or
                    anonymized data for limited purposes, in particular to help us understand the performance of the
                    FreeStyle App and LibreLinkUp App, to help us understand issues which may need fixing with the apps
                    and to help us understand how many times the apps have been downloaded from App Stores.
If, in addition to using the LibreView Data Management System, you use the FreeStyle Desktop
                        Software
, please note that information uploaded to the LibreView Data Management System is
                    hosted separately and independently from the FreeStyle Desktop Software. Abbott will not combine
                    data from these two services (de-identified data obtained through the FreeStyle Desktop Software and
                    personal information uploaded to and contained in the LibreView Data Management System). Abbott uses
                    administrative, technical and organizational measures to ensure that these data flows remain
                    separate.
We use the terms ‘de-identified’ and ‘pseudonymized’ interchangeably. US Health Insurance
                    Portability and Accountability Act and its implementing regulations (HIPAA)
                    describe de-identified information as information where
‘there is no reasonable basis to believe
                        that the information can be used to identify an individual’
. The EU General Data Protection
                    Regulation
                    (2016/679) (GDPR) defines ‘pseudonymization’ as
‘the processing of personal data in such a manner
                        that the personal
                        data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
                        information’

+Data Storage
Abbott uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), CROC or Microsoft Azure to host your LibreView Data
                    Management System accounts in the cloud. The servers that host LibreView Data Management System
                    accounts may be located in
                    North America (United States, Canada), Europe (Ireland, France, Germany), Russia, UAE, and the Asia Pacific
                    countries (China, Japan, Australia, Singapore). You will be asked for your country of residence when
                    you create a
                    LibreView Data Management account. The country of residence that you select will determine where
                    your data is stored. For example, if you reside in a member country of the European Union (EU), your
                    personal information
                    and health-related information you upload to your LibreView Data Management System account will be
                    stored on servers within the territory of the European Union (Ireland, France, or Germany). For French users, Abbott hosts
                    LibreView Data Management
                    System accounts with AWS in France. AWS is certified by the French agency for digital health, the ANS 
                    to host health-related information. The personal information and health-related information you
                    upload to your LibreView
                    Data Management System account may be stored in the country closest to your country of residence or
                    otherwise in accordance with the data storage and privacy requirements of your selected country.
                    When your personal
                    information is hosted in a country other than the country you selected, it may become subject to the
                    laws of the host country, which may not be equivalent to the laws of the country you selected. If
                    you have incorrectly
                    identified a different country as your country of residence, do not complete the installation.

Unless otherwise stated above, Abbott will continue to store your personal information while you
                    have an active LibreView Data Management System account. Your LibreView Data Management System
                    account will be considered to be inactive once there has been no activity on it for six (6) months.
                    Once your LibreView Data Management System account is considered inactive or where you delete your
                    account, all personal information will be permanently and irrevocably deleted unless (1) Abbott is
                    required or permitted to retain the personal information or (2) with respect to such information
                    that has already been or is in the process of being anonymized, de-identified, pseudonymized and/or
                    aggregated for the purposes set out in the section titled
+Research
.
                    We will notify you in advance by sending an email to the email address associated with your
                    LibreView Data Management System account so that you have an opportunity to ensure your account
                    stays current and available for your use. The section titled
+Deleting Your LibreView Data
                            Management System Account
explains how you can delete your account and what happens
                    to your personal information once your account has been deleted.
+Disclosure of Personal Information
We share personal information including health-related information with the following, and in each
                    case only the minimum amount of personal information is shared for the purposes for which the third
                    party is engaged:
Health care providers:
If your health care provider has created a LibreView Data Management
                    System Professional User account, your health care provider has the ability to use the LibreView
                    Data Management System to create patient profiles and to connect your reader to their LibreView Data
                    Management System account to view and print out a patient report and to remotely view patient
                    reports and share those reports with other professionals in their practice. Abbott discloses such
                    information pursuant to its contract with your health care provider and processes such data as a
                    ‘processor’.
Where requested by your health care provider, Abbott may also share your personal information with
                    your health care provider’s electronic medical records system (but only in countries where this is
                    permitted or where you have opted-in or otherwise consented to such sharing). Where Abbott shares
                    your personal information and health-related information, it does so under a data sharing agreement
                    with your health care provider.
If you are in the United States, Abbott may disclose your personal information to your health care
                    provider or with other third parties in accordance with our
Abbott Diabetes
                        Care Notice of Privacy Practices
, including when your health care provider requests that the
                    LibreView Data Management System send a report of your glucose data directly to their electronic
                    medical record system. Please see the section titled
+HIPAA Notice for
                            individual users in the United States of America
and
+USA
for additional information.
Abbott Laboratories:
We share your personal information with our parent company to assist us
                    as a processor with the de-identification, pseudonymization, aggregation and/or anonymization
                    process and assist us with IT operations to support the diagnostic data platform.
Third-party suppliers:
We share personal information with third-party suppliers solely to
                    provide, maintain, host, and support the LibreView Data Management System. Abbott uses Amazon Web
                    Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and other cloud providers (see below) to host LibreView Data
                    Management System accounts in the cloud. (Please see the section titled
+Data Storage
for further information) Where we provide your personal information to
                    third-party suppliers to assist us with the provision of your LibreView Data Management System
                    account, they are required to keep your personal information confidential and secure and to use your
                    personal information to the minimum extent necessary. Where possible, Abbott uses third party
                    service providers to report system errors so that we can support and improve the LibreView Data
                    Management System and in such instances, the information sent to such third parties will not involve
                    the use of your personal information.
Abbott uses third-party service providers to provide you with the LibreView Data Management System.
                    For example, we use third-party service providers to report when either the FreeStyle App or
                    LibreLinkUp App crashes or experiences certain scanning errors so that we can support and improve
                    the apps, and when these crashes or scanning errors occur, the app will send certain information
                    about the incident to such third parties. The information sent to such third parties will not
                    involve the use of your personal information. Abbott uses Lomaco et AGPS to ensure invoicing of
                    telemedicine acts in France to the social security system. Some versions of the FreeStyle family of
                    products may be accessed via mobile devices that may contain pre-loaded third-party operating and
                    device management software. More information about the device manufacturers’ privacy practices may
                    be found in the device manufacturers’ privacy policy or website(s).
For some FreeStyle Apps, Android devices require location services permissions to be granted in
                    order to discover and connect to the FreeStyle Libre sensor using Bluetooth technologies. The data
                    from such location services is not collected by the FreeStyle App or transferred from the device; as
                    such, it cannot be used by Abbott. Once the sensor is connected, location services permissions can
                    be turned off with no impact on the FreeStyle App; however, they must be turned on again to connect
                    to a new sensor. For more information on Google’s privacy practices, please see Android’s support
                    website.
Abbott also uses third party suppliers to send surveys and collect your responses for research
                    purposes and will, if required by law, obtain your consent to do so.
Local affiliated Abbott companies:
We may share your personal information with local
                    affiliated Abbott companies with whom we are jointly marketing a product or service or jointly
                    conducting a program or activity. This will only occur where you consent to sharing, for example,
                    where you opt-in to receive marketing communications from Abbott (or its affiliates) or where we
                    have a legitimate basis for sharing personal information as described in this Privacy Notice. Where
                    we require assistance from Abbott companies in your country to address diagnostics/troubleshooting
                    and the fault you have reported, we will share the minimum of your personal information necessary to
                    them.
Third Party Partners of Abbott:
We also may share your personal information with third
                    parties where you have expressly asked us to do so and/or consented to share your personal
                    information, including where you use the share functionality in the LibreView Data Management
                    System. When you use that share functionality your personal information, including health-related
                    information from your third party connected device, sensor or reader, such as your glucose targets, glucose values,
                    insulin, logged food, logged exercise and other logged notes may be shared. Where you decide to
                    share your personal information, including health-related information, the use of your personal
                    information, including health-related information by the third party partner of Abbott is not
                    governed by this Privacy Notice, and will be governed by the third party partner’s privacy policy.
Your third party connected device, where applicable, may share data with the LibreView Data Management System. When you connect the device of an Abbott third party partner to the LibreView Data Management system, and your third party connected device shares data with the LibreView Data Management System, the consent choices that you have made for the LibreView Data Management system will apply to the data you share from the connected device to Abbott. The sharing and use of your data by the third party partner will be governed by the third party partner’s privacy policy.
You can elect to stop sharing data to/from your LibreView Data Management System account at any time by
                    turning off the sharing function.
Other third parties:
We may share de-identified, pseudonymized, aggregated, and/or anonymized
                    information with affiliated Abbott companies and with other third parties for the purposes relating
                    to
+Research
as set out above. This is information which Abbott
                    securely holds and will not be used to identify you individually by your name or email address.
We will not sell or license your personal information to third parties except in connection with the
                    sale, merger, or transfer of a product line or division, so that the buyer can continue to provide
                    you with information and services. We will not sell your personal information for commercial
                    purposes to third parties and we may only share your personal information with third parties where
                    you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law.
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to respond to requests from any competent
                    law enforcement body, regulatory or government agency, court or other third party where we believe
                    the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with a regulatory requirement, judicial
                    proceeding, court order, government request or legal process served on us, or to protect the safety,
                    rights, or property of our customers, the public, Abbott or others, and to exercise, establish or
                    defend Abbott’s legal rights or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
                    action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
                    safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Notice, or as evidence in litigation in which we
                    are involved. Your personal information may be subject to foreign laws and may be accessible by
                    foreign governments, courts, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies.
+How You May Share Information with your Health Care Provider or Others
The LibreView Data Management System allows users to share information with health care providers and professional users of LibreView. You may also share your personal and health-related information with a person you invite to use the LibreLinkUp app. Depending on your selection of country, you may have limited ability to connect to other users of the LibreView Data Management System who choose a different country of residence. Where you use the share functionality in the FreeStyle App, we may share your personal information with your health care provider or with other third parties.  We may also share your personal information with third parties where you have expressly asked us to do so and/or provided consent to share your data with our partners and third parties.
You may elect to share information with health care providers by allowing your health care provider
                    to connect your reader to their LibreView Data Management System Professional User account or by
                    using the share functionality in the FreeStyle App.
Where you use the share functionality in the FreeStyle App, you can send reports with your personal
                    information and glucose data to your health care provider.
Where your health care provider has created a LibreView Data Management System Professional User
                    account, your health care provider has the ability to use the LibreView Data Management System to
                    create patient profiles and to connect your reader to their LibreView Data Management System account
                    to view and print out a patient report and to remotely view patient reports and share those reports
                    with other professionals in their practice.
When you provide your health care provider access to your LibreView Data Management System account
                    or where your health care provider sets up a LibreView Data Management System account for you,
                    Abbott (through the LibreView Data Management System) will be processing your personal information
                    on behalf of your health care provider to protect your vital interests as determined by your health
                    care provider. Abbott will process your personal information, including health-related information,
                    as a ‘processor’ for the purpose of the healthcare they provide to you to protect your vital
                    interests and your health care provider will be the controller of your personal information in such
                    instances.
Abbott may also share your personal information with your health care provider where you have
                    consented to or opted into connecting your LibreView Data Management System account to your health
                    care provider’s electronic medical records system if you are located in a country that requires such
                    consent or opt-in.
If you are in the United States, Abbott may disclose your personal information to your health care
                    provider or with other third parties in accordance with our
Abbott Diabetes Care
                        Notice of Privacy Practices
, including when your health care provider requests that the
                    LibreView Data Management System send a report of your glucose data directly to their electronic
                    medical record system. Please see the section titled
+HIPAA Notice for
                            individual users in the United States of America
and
+USA
for additional information.
+Security of Personal Information
We have implemented administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal
                    information, including health-related information, from unauthorized or unlawful access, accidental
                    loss, destruction, damage, misuse, disclosure and alteration, including the use of cryptographic
                    technologies. Abbott restricts access to personal information by its employees on a need to know
                    basis. Personal information including health-related information may only be accessed by duly
                    authorized personnel, respecting the principles of proportionality and necessity, and all personal
                    information is treated with confidentiality. Please keep in mind that no internet or Wi-Fi
                    transmission is 100% secure, so please exercise caution when uploading personal information,
                    especially health-related information, to your LibreView Data Management System account.
FreeStyle sensors transmit personal glucose information to FreeStyle mobile apps and devices using
                    NFC (Near Field Communication) and Bluetooth technologies. NFC and Bluetooth are both secure means
                    of transferring information between devices. NFC has the added level of protection by requiring
                    very close physical proximity. Encrypted Bluetooth connections for FreeStyle sensors are established
                    during an NFC communication between a FreeStyle sensor and a FreeStyle mobile app or reader.
Please be aware that the LibreView Data Management System may be unavailable during periods of
                    routine maintenance.
For LibreView users: Two-factor authentication may be required, where available, for you to log into
                    LibreView and to complete your LibreView Data Management System account registration. You may either
                    provide your phone number, email address, or other means to be authenticated as a user of your
                    account. You also have an option to “remember me” to avoid repeating the two-factor authentication
                    process and you will be able to “reset” your “remember me” settings in order to be prompted to
                    complete two-factor authentication the next time you log into LibreView.
For FreeStyle App users: Use of the custom alarm feature may require you to permit access to mobile phone storage in order to play the custom alarm.
You are responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your LibreView Data Management
                    System account and devices.
                    We recommend securing access to LibreView by logging-out, choosing a robust password for your
                    LibreView Data
                    Management System account that nobody else knows or can easily guess, implementing security settings
                    on your
                    mobile device or computer such as a password to access it, keeping your device locked when not in
                    use and
                    keeping your account information and password private. Abbott is not responsible for any lost,
                    stolen or
                    compromised passwords or for any activity on your LibreView Data Management System account from
                    unauthorized
                    users where caused by you. If you think your account has been compromised, please contact us as soon
                    as you are
                    able at
DiabetesCarePrivacy@abbott.com

+Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Information
If you selected a country outside the United States of America as your country of residence, we may
                    occasionally need to access, transfer or view your personal information to provide you with
                    technical or other customer support related to the use of your LibreView Data Management System
                    account and/or support and maintain the LibreView Data Management System. The personal information
                    may include your name, email address, and in certain exceptional circumstances, your health-related
                    information, where the technical issue requires the support team to view such information. Access to
                    personal information is via a secure network from the United States of America and only occurs to
                    the extent it is necessary for us to provide the technical or other customer support required,
                    and/or to maintain the LibreView Data Management System.
If you request our support and share your diagnostic/ troubleshooting data (including health-related

+How Abbott Sends Marketing and Other Material
Abbott (or its affiliates) may send you advertising and marketing-related information or request
                    that you participate in surveys about diabetes care or other products and services, provide you with
                    news and newsletters, or notify you about special offers and promotions at any time if (where
                    required by law) you opted-in to receive such communications or if we have a legitimate basis for
                    sending you this material.
You may receive marketing information which is tailored to your specific needs based on the
                    information uploaded or connected to your LibreView Data Management System, such as account profile
                    (name, age range, mobile, email address and country) with other information you may have provided to
                    us for marketing purposes, such as your address, and if you’re a FreeStyle App User the time of your
                    first sensor scan and frequency of sensor use, and whether you have Type I or Type II diabetes so
                    that we can send you information relevant to you.
You will be provided with an opportunity to opt-in to these communications (where required by law)
                    when you first provide us with your personal information and when you log into your LibreView Data
                    Management System account. After you opt-in, you will also be provided an opportunity to opt-out
                    through each marketing communication you receive from us. These materials may be sent by us or by an
                    affiliate of Abbott. You may opt out from receiving marketing-related communications by either
                    clicking on the unsubscribe link in each marketing-related communication or by contacting us at
DiabetesCarePrivacy@abbott.com
.
                    We will process opt-out requests without undue delay.
Neither Abbott nor its affiliates or licensors will knowingly send advertising or marketing-related
                    information to children.
Abbott will not sell your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Where you opt out of receiving marketing-related information about diabetes care, we may send you
                    non-marketing related information, where required by law, such as information related to necessary
                    system and service updates or issues relating to user or product safety.
+How Abbott Protects Children’s Privacy
Each user is required to enter their date of birth and country so that we may establish whether the
                    user is a child under the law of their country. If a date of birth attributable to a child is
                    entered, the user will be required to enter the email address of a parent/guardian before a
                    LibreView Data Management System account will be created. The parent/guardian must consent to the
                    child’s use of the LibreView Data Management System. Upon such consent, a LibreView Data Management
                    System account will be created for the parent/guardian for use by a child.
Where a child wishes to use any functions in the LibreView Data Management System that disclose
                    their personal information, including health-related information, to any other party, the child is
                    prevented from doing so without obtaining the consent of his or her parent/guardian. Before a child
                    may take such an action, the parent/guardian is required to enter his or her password to enable this
                    functionality. We will send parents/guardians notice via their registered email address when such
                    settings have been accessed, and it is the parent’s/guardian’s responsibility to manage these
                    settings for the child.
At any time, a parent/guardian may stop the collection of a child’s personal information, including
                    health-related information, by requesting that Abbott delete the LibreView Data Management System
                    account used
                    by a child by contacting us at
DiabetesCarePrivacy@abbott.com
.This action will delete the account being
                    used by the child but we retain information that has already been or is in the process of being
                    anonymized, aggregated, pseudonymized and/or de-identified for the purposes set out in the section
                    titled
+Research
and we may need to retain certain personal
                    information as required by law. See
+Retention of
                            Personal Information
for more information.
+How Individual Users can Access and Correct Personal Information and Your Rights
You may correct your profile information (your name, mobile phone number (where it is applicable),
                    country, date of birth (except children), email address and password) through the LibreView Data
                    Management System account settings, or through the settings within your FreeStyle App or LibreLinkUp
                    App. We are not able to correct or amend any sensor readings that you have uploaded into your
                    LibreView Data Management System account or any data uploaded from a FreeStyle reader, but we will
                    assist you with deleting your LibreView Data Management System account and creating a new one so
                    that you can reload the correct information.
Depending on your place of residence, you may have the right to: (a) access the personal information
                    we hold about you; (b) request we correct any inaccurate personal information we hold about you; (c)
                    delete any personal information we hold about you; (d) restrict or cease the processing of personal
                    information we hold about you; (e) object to the processing of personal information we hold about
                    you; and/or (f) receive any personal information you have provided to us on the basis of your
                    consent in a structured and commonly used machine-readable format or have such personal information
                    transmitted to another company by using the export function in your LibreView Data Management System
                    account, where accessible. Please note that Abbott is not required by law to adopt or maintain
                    systems that are technically compatible with other companies. It may not be possible for Abbott to
                    directly transmit your personal information to another company.
Children may also have the right to access the personal information held about them through the
                    LibreView Data Management System. Where we receive a request for access for a child’s personal
                    information from the child’s parent/guardian, we may respond directly to the child’s
                    parent/guardian. We will always seek to verify the identity of person seeking access to a child’s
                    information, whether it is from the child him/herself or from a parent or guardian.
To request the exercise of these rights, please contact us using any of the methods set out in the
                    section titled
+Contact Us
.
+Deleting Your LibreView Data Management System Account
If you would like to delete your LibreView Data Management System account, you may do so by logging
                    into your LibreView Data Management System account via www.libreview.com and using the delete
                    account functionality. Please be aware that if you delete your account, all data in the LibreView
                    Data Management System account will be deleted but we will retain information that has already been
                    or is in the process of being anonymized, aggregated, pseudonymized and/or de-identified for the
                    purposes set out in the section titled
+Research
. We may also need
                    to retain certain personal information when required by law. See
+Retention of Personal Information
for
                    more information.
Once your LibreView Data Management System account has been deleted, you will no longer have access
                    to the LibreView Data Management System and deletion of your account is irreversible. You are not
                    therefore able to reactivate your LibreView Data Management System account or retrieve any personal
                    information, including health-related information, so you may want to download and save any required
                    information before requesting that we delete your account from the LibreView Data Management System.
If you have chosen to share your LibreView Data Management System account information with your
                    health care provider or with other connections and you delete your account, those persons will no
                    longer be able to view your glucose readings.
Please be aware that if your health care provider has set up their own account in the LibreView Data
                    Management System and created a patient profile specific to you, your deletion of your LibreView
                    Data Management System account may have no effect on the account or patient profile created by your
                    health care provider.
If you reside in the United States, please see the
+USA
section for
                    additional information related to deleting your LibreView Data Management System Account.
Abbott reserves the right to delete inactive LibreView Data Management System accounts after six (6)
                    months. We will notify you in advance by sending an email to the email address associated with your
                    LibreView Data Management System account so that you have an opportunity to ensure your account
                    stays current and available for your use.
