Sharing your personal data both between the Marshmallow Group and to third parties may involve transferring your personal data to countries outside the EU and UK.

Please contact us at
dpo@marshmallow.co
for more information on the protections that we put in place.
‍
6. Presence of automated decision-making
‍
Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal data to make a decision without human intervention. We use automated decision-making technology to combine the information you provide with data from our partners (listed above) in order to offer you quotes and provide you with a policy.
‍
If we make an automated decision using your personal data which has a legal or substantially similar effect, you have rights in relation to that decision. In particular, you have the right to receive information about the logic involved in relation to the decision and the right to human intervention. You can exercise this right by emailing us at
dpo@marshmallow.co
.
‍
7. How long we keep your personal data
‍
We will only hold your personal data for as long as necessary to administer your policy, manage our business or in order to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. This will be in line with our data retention policy.
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may also retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
‍
To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we collected the data in the first place, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax and accounting requirements. By law, we have to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers.
In some circumstances, we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. In these instances, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
‍
8. Your rights under data protection legislation
‍
Under data protection laws, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:
‍
- Access
: you can request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
-Correction

: in certain circumstances, you can request that your data be deleted (commonly known as an “erasure request”). Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
-
Objection
: you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular of your data. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.
-
Consent withdrawal
: you have the absolute right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. Note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out to withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products to you but we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
-
Transfer
: you can request the transfer of your personal data to you or another party. This right only applies to information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we have used the information to perform a contract with you.
-
Restrict
: in certain scenarios, you can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data.
If you want to exercise any of the rights set out above, please visit our
privacy portal

Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In such cases, we will inform you and keep you updated on the progress of your request.
‍
9. Where we store your data
‍
We use cloud storage solutions within the UK and EU to store your personal data. In some situations, we may store your data in similar technologies outside of the UK or EU.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK and EU.
Your data will be stored on our recruitment platform for 1 year after we have communicated to you our decision about whether to appoint you to a role. We retain your personal data for that period so that we can show, in the event of a legal claim, that we have not discriminated against candidates on prohibited grounds and that we have conducted the recruitment exercise in a fair and transparent way. After this period, we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with our data retention policy.
We will only contact you about similar roles if you have provided your consent for us to do so. You have the right to withdraw your consent for processing for that purpose at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact
talentacquisition@marshmallow.co
.
If your application is successful then your data will be processed in accordance with our employee privacy notice.
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
●
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
●
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
●
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
●
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
●
Request the restriction
of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
●
Request the transfer
of your personal data to another party.
We know data protection can be confusing. If you have any questions or concerns about how we use your personal data, reach out to our Data Protection Officer by emailing
dpo@marshmallow.co
.
We would always suggest referring your complaint to us in the first case so we can try to handle your complaint. However, you have the right to make a complaint to the ICO relating to our data protection practices. To do that, you can use their complaint web form
