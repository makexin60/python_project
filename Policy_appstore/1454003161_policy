Incoming or outgoing transactions can be initiated with the help of our platform and sent to the respective blockchain via your Crypto Vaults, which means that for each transaction, one of the addresses (public key) stored in your Crypto Vaults is published on the respective public blockchain and is publicly accessible in pseudonymised form over the internet.
Although Crypto Vault addresses do not appear at first glance to be personally identifiable information because they are pseudonymized, they are considered personal data under the GDPR because it is possible for us to associate individual addresses with our users for the purposes of providing our services.
Since the Bitcoin Vault provider is located in the US, any of your interactions with the Bitcoin Vault, including your creation, will transfer information about digital assets to the US. A sufficient level of data protection is ensured by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework decided by the EU Commission.
