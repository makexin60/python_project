Submission Guide
On this page
Before You Submit
​
1. Enroll with Apple as an Organization
​
For your iOS apps, please
enroll
as an organization (not as an individual) with the Apple Developer Program. Apple requires competition skill-based games to be submitted by organizations, only.
2. Get Production Tester Login
​
You need to provide Apple with a Skillz Production login so that they can test Skillz related features. This is to make sure Apple can test the functionality in your game. Without a login, your app may be rejected.
A test login you can provide them with is:
Username
:
Apple-tester
Password
:
Contact us
for the Apple tester credentials or reach out to your Skillz account manager
3. Name Your App
​
All Skillz based games must be skill-based. Please refer to our
recommendations
on naming your app so that your app will not be mistaken for a chance-based game.
4. Upload Binaries to Skillz
​
Within Xcode, click
Product -> Archive
. Select your build and click
Distribute App
.
Follow the prompts to upload to App Store Connect:
Select
Export

Manage Version and Build Number
in the distribution options. Deselecting this prevents Xcode from overwriting your set version and build numbers in the main app and in framework dependencies.
An
.ipa
file will be created in you local filesystem. Upload this build to the Skillz Developer Console. Additional information can be found on the
Going Live with Skillz page
.
Make sure the game binary you upload to Skillz is the same exact build as the one you upload to Apple. If you upload different binaries, Skillz Production will not work as a security precaution against unauthorized software.
Submit Your Game to the iOS App Store
​
1. Add a New App by Uploading to App Store Connect
​
Xcode now allows the New App creation to be done automatically by pushing your build up to App Store Connect.
See Apple docs

4. Prepare for Submission
​
Now, navigate to the "Prepare for Submission" page. This is where a number of items must be completed before being able to submit your app to await approval from Apple.
5. App Privacy Questionnaire
​
Apple has rolled out a
new mandatory developer survey
asking for information about what user data is collected by their app and what this data is used for. Responding to this survey is mandatory for all developers who have an app on the Apple AppStore.
To aid developers with games developed on the Skillz platform, Skillz has laid out sample responses to this survey based on the collection and usage of user data in the Skillz SDK.
DISCLAIMER:
​
The below responses are the Skillz-recommended declarations if your game uses the Skillz SDK alone and does not use any other 3rd-party SDKs aside from Skillz. If you do use additional 3rd party SDKs, you are responsible to understand how those SDKs collect and use user data in order to properly respond to the questionnaire.
Questionnaire Structure
​
There are two questionnaires that need to be filled out:
The first questionnaire pertains to WHAT user data is collected.
The second questionnaire pertains to HOW that data is used.
Responses to the First Questionnaire: WHAT user data is collected
​
Select

to data collection for the following fields for each category:
Contact info:
Select “Name”, “Email Address”, “Phone Number”, “Physical Address”

6. Upload App Previews and Screenshots
​
Be sure to upload app previews (re: videos) and screenshots for required platforms. Screenshots must conform to the exact dimensions listed for each specific platform. An easy way to meet these requirements is to run your app on the Simulator for a platform and selecting the
New Screenshot
item from the File menu:
Here is an example of a screenshot uploaded for the an iPhone with 5.5" screen:
Refer to the App Store documentation for guidelines on how to produce compelling
app previews

Notes:
In accordance with Section 5.3.4, skill-gaming competitions (powered by Skillz) are geo-restricted to players located where competing for real money in skill-based games is legal. Because the game also includes free tournaments that do not have cash prizes, the app can be accessed from anywhere but users in prohibited jurisdictions are blocked from entering real money competitions.
In accordance with Section 3, the game’s multiplayer functionality allows players to deposit money into an account for competing against other players for real prizes (where allowed by law). The deposited money is not a virtual good and cannot be used for the purchase of virtual goods.
Attachment:
(not usually needed)
10. Export Compliance Information
​
The Export Compliance Information question asks if your game uses cryptography. Choose Yes as the Skillz SDK leverages HTTPS for its traffic.
11. Submit for Review
​
Click the "Submit for Review" button. It typically takes
24-48 hours
for an app to be reviewed. However, this could take longer if your submission has incomplete or missing information.
You can view the status of your app submission in the
My Apps
section of the iTunes Connect site.
Please refer to the
App Store Review Guidelines
for more information, especially if your app submission was rejected.
12. Add App ID to Developer Console
​
Once your submission is approved, remember to enter your app's
App ID

We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider. Please see “Your Choices About Online Ads” below, to learn more about interest-based advertising.
9.1 Your Choices About Cookies
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to change the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Be aware that disabling cookies may negatively affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionalities and features of the Services. Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.

9.2 Your Choices About Online Ads
To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at

http://youradchoices.com/appchoices
and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s principles.

However, we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or change in our active databases, subject to any obligations under any applicable law. Where permissible, we may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms of Service.
