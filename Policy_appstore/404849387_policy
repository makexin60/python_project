Personal Information that we "Share," "Sell," or Use for "Targeted Advertising"
We disclose the following categories of personal information to third parties for the purpose of engaging in targeted advertising and other marketing activities, including to expand the reach and effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns, for example to help avoid duplicative advertising to you.  In some cases, this information may also be used for the third parties’ own marketing purposes. These activities are considered “sales,” “sharing,” or “targeted advertising” under certain state laws and you have the right to opt out of having your personal information used or disclosed for these purposes.
This
means that we share identifiers, such as your IP address or your mobile device's marketing identifier, with 3rd parties who help us categorize you and other consumers into audiences and then adjust the advertising you see based on characteristics of that audience so that ads are more relevant.  You may opt out of this sharing at any time; if you do opt out you will still see advertising, but we will not share your data for purposes of tailoring those ads to our understanding of your interests.
Certain state laws also provide you with the right to opt out of data processing that constitutes “profiling” for purposes of decisions that may have a legal or similar effect, such as hiring or issuance of credit.  Here, “profiling” means the use of a solely automated process to render a decision. REI does not currently engage in any such “profiling.”
See below
for details about opting out.

Other Details About Our Information Practices
As described in more detail in our
Privacy Notice
, we collect personal information from different sources, including: directly from you; automatically when you access or use our Services or shop in our stores; and from third-party sources, including the financial institutions we partner with if you apply for certain co-branded financial products, and other users if they decide to purchase a gift for you.
We do not knowingly collect, sell, or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16.
We generally do not collect information that is considered “sensitive” under state privacy laws. In the limited circumstances that we do, such as collection of your account username and password, which is designated as “sensitive” under the California Consumer Privacy Act, we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.
We store personal information associated with your account for as long as your account remains active. If you close your account, we will delete your account data; otherwise, we will delete your account data after a period of inactivity. We store other personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other business purposes explained in this Notice.

In some cases, we may provide additional terms and conditions for a financial incentive, which we will provide to you when you sign up. The value of your personal information is reasonably related to the value of the offer or discount presented to you.
Notice of Bona Fide Loyalty Program
REI is organized as a cooperative business and offers membership to any natural person in return for a one-time membership fee.  REI membership provides certain organizational rights, such as authorization to vote on its Board, but also certain rewards and benefits, such as discounts, rewards, free shipping and member-only events.  Some state privacy laws may consider this a “bona fide loyalty program,” and as such we provide here notice of the personal data collection for REI membership and what to expect may happen to membership benefits if you request we delete your membership. When you join REI as a Member, we collect personal information from you, such as identifiers (like your name and email address), commercial information (like your purchase history), and inferences. We disclose this information to our cloud service providers and marketing and advertising partners, including for the purpose of engaging in targeted advertising and other marketing activities.

To the extent the Rewards Program is related to the value of Member personal information, the method for calculating that value would include the value related to our offer or discount. The value of your Member personal information that we collect will vary depending on the engagement by each Member.
