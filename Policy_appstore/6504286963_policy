Effective Date: 2024-07-25
Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the HUD VPN app (referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, developed by CO CO HI TECH LLC (referred to as "Service Provider") as a free service. This service is provided on an "AS IS" basis.
Acceptance of Privacy Terms
By using the application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using the application.
Data Security Commitment
Protecting our customers' data is our top priority. We only collect essential user data required to provide and maintain our services. All terms used in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use. By accessing, installing, or using the application app and submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this Privacy Policy and enter into a legal agreement with CO CO HI TECH LLC, a Georgian company, referred to as HUD VPN, “we,” or “us.” The data controller for your personal data is CO CO HI TECH LLC (email: support@cocohitechllc.com). If you disagree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the application. For any inquiries regarding this policy or your privacy, contact us at support@cocohitechllc.com.
Information We Collect
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), the pages of the Application you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and the operating system you use on your mobile device. The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.
Data Processing Details
The application app processes data only as necessary for service provision, payment processing, and the operation of our website and mobile applications. Data processing may be automated or manual, with HUD VPN or its subsidiaries. We utilize third-party processors for payment processing, email services, marketing, and basic analytics. We follow a strict no-logs policy, ensuring that your activities through the HUD VPN app are not monitored or recorded.
Information Collection and Use
HUD VPN does not collect, store, or transmit personal data or any information that could identify a user. Data we handle is crash information, which helps us improve the app without processing user details.
Targeted Advertising
We may work with third-party networks using cookies and pixel tags to collect data for personalized advertising. These ads may appear on our and third-party websites and apps. You can learn more about these practices and opt-out choices at the National Advertising Initiative's website. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; they will just be less personalized. We are not responsible for third-party cookie use and advise caution when sharing personal information on external platforms. Our advertising partner is Admob (Privacy Policy: Admob Privacy Policy).
Underage Users
Individuals under 18 should not use the HUD VPN app or provide personal data without guardian supervision. We assume all users and data providers are at least 18. If we find that underage users have provided personal information, we will immediately suspend their access.
Data Processing Justification
We process your data mentioned above to provide the best possible service, based on our contract outlined in the Terms of Use.
Your Data Rights
We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws. We do not log browsing history or traffic, making it difficult to link VPN IP addresses to individual users. In legal cases, we will provide the limited data we process. You can withdraw your consent or discontinue use at any time by contacting support@cocohitechllc.com and obtaining consent.
Opt-Out and Data Retention
HUD VPN does not collect, store, or transmit personal data or any information that could identify a user. Data we handle is crash information, which helps us improve the app without processing user details.
Third Party Access
Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help the Service Provider improve the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties as described in this privacy statement.
Security
The Service Provider is dedicated to safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. They provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information they process and maintain.
Policy Amendments
This Privacy Policy may be updated at our discretion. Users are encouraged to review the latest version regularly. Changes take effect upon publication. You cannot transfer your rights under this policy to others. For questions or to enforce privacy rights, contact us at support@cocohitechllc.com.
Children
The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 18. The Application does not address anyone under the age of 18. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years of age. If the Service Provider discovers that a child under 18 has provided personal information, they will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider (support@cocohitechllc.com) so that they can take the necessary actions.
Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
Your Consent
By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
