Frequently Asked Questions
What type of information will I receive when signing up for Arrival Assistance?
We'll inform you of everything that's relevant for you to know as an incoming international student in the Netherlands, including public transportation, registering at the municipality, opening a Dutch bank account, getting a bike, etc.
Are Student Mobility and ISIC the same organisation? How are they related?
Student Mobility is an ISIC Appointed Office and thus an official issuer of the International Student Identity Card. However, it is now also its own independent organisation focusing on simplifying the lives of international students in the Netherlands.
In what way do you cooperate with educational institutions?
The two main cooperation models between HEI's and Student Mobility are;
1. Provide a "soft landing" for the new international students of the HEI
2. Cobrand and offer the ISIC Student-ID to students from a particular HEI, replacing or adding value to the existing college-card
What is ISIC actually?
ISIC is the organisation behind the International Student Identity Card, which gives you internationally accepted proof of bona fide student status. Anyone can purchase an ISIC to get preferential and discounted access to various products, services and experiences.
