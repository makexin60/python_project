Website Users
Your privacy is important to us. Individual information gathered by the International Powered Access Federation (IPAF) is only used to answer and process your enquiries. Individual information will not be used for commercial purposes nor shared with any other organisation or third party, unless required to do so by law or regulators. You will not receive any email from IPAF simply as a result of visiting our site. Relations with our member organisations to which many pages link, are governed by their respective general terms and conditions.
However, it is pointed out that mail secrecy is not guaranteed on the Internet and that it is up to each Internet user to take all appropriate measures so as to protect his/her own data and/or software from corruption by any viruses that may be circulating on the Internet. IPAF takes appropriate steps to maintain the security of each user’s information on this site. Each Internet user should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. IPAF cannot guarantee that such communications will not be intercepted or changed or that they will reach the intended recipient safely.
