Privacy Policy
Last updated: March 10, 2023
CounterPath is committed to protecting the privacy of customers and users of our website, products and services. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect from you and how we use it. This Privacy Policy pertains to our online collection of data from our web properties and to our collection of data from your use of our products or services. We encourage you to read the full policy below as by using our website, products, or services, and submitting any personal information, you consent to the collection and use of this information by CounterPath.
Also, please be aware that our Privacy Policy may change from time to time to evolve with the products and services we offer you and changing technologies. Be sure to check back here periodically for any changes.
CounterPath is sensitive to the private nature of information you provide to us over the Internet. Our privacy practices are designed to maximize your ability to control the use of your personal, private information while at the same time giving you the opportunity to obtain interesting and useful information, products, and services.
Personal Data We Collect
CounterPath collects data to operate effectively and provide you with the best experiences with our products and services. You provide some of this data directly when you purchase one of our products or services, register for a program, or when you contact us for support. We also get some of it by recording how you interact with our services, for example, using technologies like cookies, receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device, or tracking IP addresses when you visit our website.
Data we collect depends on the products, services, and features you use, and can include the following:
Name and contact data.
We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.
Credentials.
We collect passwords and security information used for authentication and account access.
Demographic data.
We collect data about you such as your country and preferred language.
Payment data.
We, or our third-party service providers, collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your credit card number, or CCV number.
Usage data.
We collect data about how you and your device interact with our services. This includes data, such as the features you use, items you purchase, and web pages you visit. This also includes data about your device and the network you use to connect to our services, including IP address, device identifiers, regional and language settings. This includes information about the operating systems and other CounterPath software installed on your device. And it includes data about the performance of the products or services and any problems you experience with them.
Location data.
We may collect information about your location in multiple ways. When you register or purchase a product or service we may request a billing address or location of use. Precise GPS location may be collected from mobile devices with your permission and may be used when making Enhanced 911 emergency calls. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine your approximate location.
Content.
We collect content of your files and communications when necessary to provide you with the services you use. For example, if you receive a message using a CounterPath hosted messaging service, we need to collect the content of that message in order to deliver it to your softphone client, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Examples of this data include the content of instant messages, or documents, photos, music or videos you file transfer using CounterPath services. When you grant the Contacts permission in our apps, we load your local address book into the app in order to provide direct access to your contacts’ names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
We also collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions or information you provide for customer support. When you contact us, such as for customer support, chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.
How We Use Personal Data
CounterPath uses the data we collect to provide you with the services we offer and to improve and personalize your experiences, as well as the products and services CounterPath provides. We also may use the data to communicate with you, including sending you information on security updates, account status notices and product changes or updates. Further details on how we specifically use your data are outlined below:
Providing and improving our products and services.
We use data to provide and improve the services we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes operating the services, maintaining, and improving the performance of the services, including development of new features, research, and providing customer support.
Communications.
We use the data we collect to deliver and personalize communications with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending, let you know when updates are available, remind you about items left in your online shopping cart, invite you to participate in a survey, or tell you about new products or services available to you. Additionally, you can choose to sign up for email subscriptions, like our News Subscription list, and choose whether you wish to receive promotional material along with your subscription. We do not sell any information we collect to third parties. With any of our promotional material emails, you will have the option to unsubscribe from future mailings from a link within the email communication.

Business operations and compliance.
CounterPath may use personally identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity that threatens either CounterPath or any company affiliated with CounterPath.

Push notification.
To let you know of incoming calls, chats and other messages, our apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, our service has to tell the company providing the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. CounterPath is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you don’t want to use the notification services with our applications, turn it off in the settings found in the application or your device.

General Data Protection Regulation (for EU residents)
Last updated: May 10, 2018
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a regulation by which the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU). While the GDPR was developed with a focus on Social Networks, companies like CounterPath that market goods or services to EU residents whose personal data is collected are subject to the regulation.
Under the GDPR, personal data is defined as: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
CounterPath will process (collect, store, and use) the information you provide us in a manner compatible with the GDPR. We will endeavor to keep your information accurate and up to date, and not keep it for longer than is necessary. CounterPath is required to retain information in accordance with the law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes. How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs. For more information on how we get and use your data, please see our privacy policy at: www.counterpath.com/privacy/
The operational data we collect as it relates to our software and services is stored in order to 1) to fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers and/or 2) is necessary for the use of services. Namely, we collect the data necessary to be able to provision the user account to be operational and to ensure compliance within the terms of our licensing and contracts. We retain data as long as required, either by our contractual obligations to our customers or by regulation. CounterPath makes use of encryption to protect the transmission and storage of data. Access to data within CounterPath is strictly controlled and limited to those that need access to perform their duties. CounterPath does not share this data with any party that is not part of the contractual obligation. A company may contract with CounterPath to purchase a softphone solution, and they in turn may provide the softphone solution to their customers. In this case, some operational data would be supplied by, and shared with, the company that is contracting for the service.
Wherever possible, CounterPath anonymizes the data it collects. CounterPath processes data as it relates to the use of our client and server software for operational and contractual compliance reasons and this data is not mixed with our marketing systems. Our marketing systems are operated separately from our operational databases and use an explicitly separate method of data collection. We expressly ask all users to opt into our marketing programs, and they may opt-out of our marketing programs at any time through an unsubscribe system. We do store data on servers outside of the EU with countries recognized by the EU under Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as providing adequate data protection.
For any user that wishes to see what information CounterPath has collected about them in the course of using our website, software, or services, they can contact us at
privacy@counterpath.com.
You can request the following information:
• Identity and the contact details of the person or organization that has determined how and why to process your data is processed.
• Contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable.
• The purpose of the processing as well as the legal basis for processing.
• If the processing is based on the legitimate interests of CounterPath or a third party, information about those interests.
• The categories of personal data collected, stored, and processed.
• Recipient(s) or categories of recipients that the data is/will be disclosed to.
• If we intend to transfer the personal data to a third country or international organization, information about how we ensure this is done securely. The EU has approved sending personal data to some countries because they meet a minimum standard of data protection. In other cases, we will ensure there are specific measures in place to secure your information.
• How long the data will be stored.
• Details of your rights to correct, erase, restrict, or object to such processing.
• Information about your right to withdraw consent at any time.
• How to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
• Whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether you are obliged to provide the personal data and the possible consequences of failing to provide such data.
• The source of personal data if it wasn’t collected directly from you.
In order to access this information, we will require scans of two of the following forms of ID: Passport, driving license, birth certificate, utility bill (from last 3 months). In order to determine what information we have recorded about the individual, we also require a means to identify the individual, such as your email address or account ID. CounterPath will validate the identity of the requester and the validity of the request, and supply the information in a reasonable timeframe (currently less than 30 days from receipt). Users then may request that specific information be removed or updated. Some of the data is stored in encrypted formats that by design even CounterPath cannot read, and will be provided in this encrypted manner. CounterPath will make the changes within a reasonable period of time within compliance with the directive (currently less than 30 days from receipt), unless the data is covered by one of the five lawful grounds for processing data, namely Contractual Obligation, Compliance with a Legal Obligation, Vital Interests, a Public Task, or Legitimate Interests.
For any organization that that wishes to update or remove any of their user’s information that CounterPath has collected about their users in the course of using our software, they can make a request via the Technical Assistance Center. In order to determine what information we have recorded about the individual, we do require a means to identify the individual, such as their email address or account ID. CounterPath will validate the identity of the requester and the validity of the request, and supply the information in a reasonable timeframe (currently less than 30 days from receipt). Organizations then may request that specific information be removed or updated. Some of the data is stored in encrypted formats that by design even CounterPath cannot read, and will be provided in this encrypted manner. CounterPath will make the changes within a reasonable period of time within compliance with the directive (currently less than 30 days from receipt), unless the data is covered by one of the five lawful grounds for processing data, namely Contractual Obligation, Compliance with a Legal Obligation, Vital Interests, a Public Task, or Legitimate Interests.
In all cases, CounterPath will respond to the requester within 30 days of each request. Once data is removed, it cannot be restored.
