POLICY TERMS
INTRODUCTION
This Policy sets out the obligations of Imagineear Ltd, a company registered in the United Kingdom under number 0688 7633, whose office is at The Compton Rooms, Fulham Palace, Bishop’s Avenue, London SW6 6EA (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries, regarding data protection and the rights of clients, suppliers and business contacts (“data subjects”) in respect of their personal data under General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The GDPR defines “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
This Policy sets out the Company’s obligations regarding the collection, processing, transfer, storage, and disposal of personal data. The procedures and principles set out herein will be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.
The Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights, privacy, and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.
THE DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply. All personal data will be:
2.1 Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.
2.2 Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes will not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes.
2.3 Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.
2.4 Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step will be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased, or rectified without delay.
2.5 Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.
2.6 Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
THE RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS
The GDPR sets out the following rights applicable to data subjects (please refer to the parts of this policy indicated for further details):
3.1 The right to be informed (Part 12).
3.2 The right of access (Part 13);
3.3 The right to rectification (Part 14);
3.4 The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) (Part 15);
3.5 The right to restrict processing (Part 16);
3.6 The right to data portability (Part 17);
3.7 The right to object (Part 18); and
3.8 Rights with respect to automated decision-making and profiling (Parts 19 and 20).
LAWFUL, FAIR, AND TRANSPARENT DATA PROCESSING

a
The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;
b
The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract with them;
c
The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject;
d
The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
e
The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; or
f
The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
4.2 If the personal data in question is “special category data” (also known as “sensitive personal data”), for example, data concerning the data subject’s race, ethnicity, politics, religion, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics (if used for ID purposes), health, sex life, or sexual orientation, at least one of the following conditions will be met:
a
The data subject has given their explicit consent to the processing of such data for one or more specified purposes (unless UK law prohibits them from doing so);
b
The processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law (insofar as it is authorised by UK law or a collective agreement pursuant to UK law which provides for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject);
c
The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
d
The data controller is a foundation, association, or other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious, or trade union aim, and the processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities, provided that the processing relates solely to the members or former members of that body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data is not disclosed outside the body without the consent of the data subjects;
e
The processing relates to personal data which is clearly made public by the data subject;
f
The processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;
g
The processing is necessary for substantial public interest reasons, on the basis of law which will be proportionate to the aim pursued, will respect the essence of the right to data protection, and will provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject;
h
The processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of an employee, for medical diagnosis, for the provision of health or social care or treatment, or the management of health or social care systems or services on the basis of UK law or pursuant to a contract with a health professional, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 9(3) of the GDPR;
i
The processing is necessary for public interest reasons in the area of public health, for example, protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of UK law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (in particular, professional secrecy); or
j
The processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) of the GDPR based on UK law which will be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.

19.2 Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data based on its legitimate interests, the Company will cease such processing immediately, unless it can be demonstrated that the Company’s legitimate grounds for such processing override the
data subject’s interests, rights, and freedoms, or that the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims.
