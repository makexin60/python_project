We aim to ensure that the processing of personal data by or on behalf of MobileFrame is fair and reasonable and that your personal data is secure, accurate, and up to date.

This information includes contact and registration information, information about the way visitors use our websites and/or services, as well as details of individual's interests.

In addition, MobileFrame may ask for information about your business, including but not limited to information such as industry, business model, user needs, or company address details.

The information described in this Privacy policy may be retained and used by MobileFrame after an individual or business ceases to use MobileFrame's services or ceases dealing with MobileFrame.

Location Data Collection and Usage (within the MobileFrame App)
The MobileFrame app may request to collect and process location data, including precise GPS-based location, approximate location derived from network sources, and background location when required by specific workflows. The collection and use of location data within the app are determined by the provider of the MobileFrame backend system to which the user connects and whom has provided the user with credentials to connect to such backend including access to such provider's data (typically the user's employer); this party providing access to a MobileFrame backend is hereafter referred to as the "Employer". Employer(s) may configure data collection workflows as part of their business operations. MobileFrame Corp. does not collect, store, or use location data for our own purposes.
When configured by the Employer, the app may collect location data at regular intervals, such as every 15 seconds while the app is in the foreground to support workflow requirements. Examples include geo-tagging photos or forms for proof of service, estimating arrival or en-route times, recording the location of field service activities, mapping routes, or enforcing geo-fencing restrictions for operational purposes. The MobileFrame app does not collection location data when it is fully closed, and background location is only accessed if specifically enabled by Employer and permissions have been granted by user as described below.
Users must explicitly grant location permissions when first using the app and may decline to grant such permissions. These permissions can be revoked by users at any time through the device settings. Disabling location services will not prevent access to the MobileFrame app but may affect the functionality of certain workflows that require location data.
All location data collected through the app is shared only with the user's Employer and is used strictly for Employer's business-related purposes. We do not sell, share, or use location data for advertising, analytics, or personal tracking. The retention and management of location data are subject to the policies of the Employer, and users should refer to their Employer's privacy policy for further details.
To ensure the security of transmitted data, all MobileFrame communications (including location data transmissions if applicable) between the MobileFrame App and its registered MobileFrame backend system(s) are encrypted to protect location data and other sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception while being transmitted between the app and Employer-controlled systems.
Our app fully complies with Google Play's location data policies by ensuring that location access is requested only when necessary for Employer's workflows / processes, that users have full control over their location permissions, and that no location data is used by MobileFrame Corp. for tracking, analytics, or advertising. For any questions regarding the collection or use of location data, users should refer to their Employer's privacy policy or contact us at support@mobileframe.com
