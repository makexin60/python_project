Cookies help us to provide you with a good experience when you use our platforms and also allow us to improve our platforms. By continuing to use and browse our platforms, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.
We use the following cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies.
These are cookies that are required for the operation of our platforms. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our platforms.
Analytical/performance cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our platforms when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our sites and/or the App works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
Functionality cookies.
These are used to recognise you when you return to our platforms. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
Targeting cookies.
These cookies record your visits to our platforms, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our platforms and any advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
Remarketing cookies.
You may notice that sometimes after visiting a site you see increased numbers of adverts from the site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves, pay for these adverts. The technology to do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a so-called "remarketing cookie" during your visit. We use these adverts to offer special offers etc to encourage you to come back to our site. We cannot proactively reach out to you as the process is entirely anonymised.
You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below:

where it is otherwise necessary for our legitimate interests (or those interests of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
Our Legal Basis for processing data
Organisations that collect and use personal data must have a lawful basis for doing so under data protection law and we are required to let you know the lawful basis on which we rely to process your personal data. We rely upon the following lawful bases:
Your consent to use your data for a particular purpose (for example to send you direct marketing by e-mail or to collect sensitive personal data);
Where the use of the data is in our “legitimate interests” (see below for more information);
Where we need to process your data in order to perform our obligations under a contract that we have entered into with you (for example to enrol you in an event or provide you with access to resources); and
To process data where we are under a legal obligation to do so.
Will we share your information with others?
We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which includes our group companies both in the UK and outside the UK.
We may share your information with selected third parties including:
business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
we may (with your consent, where appropriate) pass your details onto third parties including our partners to provide you with information and offers which may be of interest to you;
advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in south London). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience; and
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our platforms.
How do we protect the security of personal data?
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
While we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal data, you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal data that are transferred via the internet. If you have any particular concerns about your information, please contact us.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
The information we collect from you may be transferred to and processed and/or stored at a destination outside the UK. If we send your personal data outside the UK we will ensure a similar level of protection is afforded to it, by ensuring that we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
How long do we keep your data for?
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.
