Aavia Privacy Principles
Last Updated: May 10, 2024
At Aavia, we believe your body is your business. This should be the norm, not an exception.
We take your privacy seriously and want you to understand how we use, collect and share your personal information. Your personal information includes health information about your body and state of mind that you provide to Aavia while using our services, such as information about your birth control pills and your menstrual cycle. We have invested heavily, and will continue to invest, in features and security to protect the privacy and security of your health information and other personal information. We continually evaluate our privacy practices to ensure that we treat your personal information in compliance with applicable privacy laws.
Please note that we may de-identify, aggregate, or anonymize your health information in such a way that it no longer identifies you.  We may use this type of information for purposes we think will benefit our users, such as for research, to understand trends and habits, or for advertising.  You can find more detailed information about ways in which we use, collect, and share personal information below.  If you are interested in further details, please review our
PRIVACY POLICY
.
AAVIA MEMBERS CONTROL THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We believe you should be in control of your personal information. Consistent with this belief:
We will delete your personal information if you ask us to (unless we are legally prohibited from doing so), including if asked when you cancel your membership.
We will provide you with access to your personal information if you ask us to, including if asked if you cancel your membership.
We will NOT share your identifiable health information with others except to the extent necessary to run and provide our services. Our service providers are contractually bound to only use your health information to provide services to us and are prohibited from sharing your health information with third parties (unless they are required to do so under applicable laws). For example, we may use a cloud service provider to store health information you provide while using our app.
AAVIA DOES NOT SELL MEMBER PERSONAL INFORMATION
Our business model is to provide highly valuable product experiences and services to our members in exchange for membership fees. We do not monetize your identifiable health information or other personal information. As such, we do not sell your health information or other personal information. This is our promise.
We may use personal information other than health information to help us identify and connect with other people who may be interested in becoming members.
AAVIA PROTECTS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We believe that your personal information and health information should be protected from unauthorized access to the fullest extent possible. To that end, we have implemented security measures to protect your personal information in line with the highest industry standards, including encrypting your personal information at rest on our hosted servers, limiting access to and sharing of your personal information only for purposes of running our services and delivering our products to you, and working with outside privacy and security experts to assess the security of our tech, data storage and privacy and security practices and to implement their recommendations.
AAVIA MAY SHARE AGGREGATED OR DE-IDENTIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION TO CREATE BETTER EXPERIENCES FOR OUR MEMBERS
We may share aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized personal information, including health information, that does not identify particular individuals for research, to understand trends and habits, for advertising, and for other purposes. We believe we have a responsibility to create an ever-better experience for our members by identifying and sharing cutting edge insights. We will always look to provide new content and product features, improve and customize our services, and develop thought leadership in the area of hormone health without identifying you.
We know privacy and security are important to you and that you are trusting us with intimate health information. We are committed to making Aavia the best platform to understand and optimize your health based on your hormone cycle. We will continue to be transparent about our privacy and security practices as we grow alongside our membership.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.

explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

While we do not sell Personal Information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver targeted ads (also known as interest-based ads) to you, as we have described in the “How and Why We Use Your Personal Data” section above. The CCPA classifies our use of some of these services as “sharing” your Personal Information with the advertising partners that provide the services, from which you have the right to opt-out.
Right to Nondiscrimination
. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination prohibited by the CCPA.
11.3 HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS
Right to Information/Know, Access, Correction, and Deletion
. You can exercise any of these rights by submitting a request through our
Privacy Request Form
or by mailing us at 55 2nd Street, 4th Fl., San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, Attention: Compliance.
Right to Opt-Out of Tracking for Targeted Advertising Purposes
. You can submit requests to opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes by using our
Cookie Management Center
. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request.
Verification of Identity
. We will need to verify your identity to process your information/know, access, correction, and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into an Intercom online account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law.
Authorized Agents
. Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent's identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
