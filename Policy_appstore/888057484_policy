You and We agree that our sole relationship is a contractual one governed by these Terms and the Code of Conduct. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the provision of services or materials by Us shall be resolved solely based on these Terms.
13.	DISPUTE RESOLUTION
ALL DISPUTES WITH TLC MEDIA LLC ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS
          AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING OR IN SMALL CLAIMS
          COURT.
This includes any claims against other parties relating to this Agreement or the use
          of the Software (such as employees, affiliates, and vendors). This
          Agreement affects interstate commerce such that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal
          arbitration law apply. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN
          ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).
The Company may terminate your access to and use of the Company Sites and Materials at
          any time. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to (i) breaches
          or violations of these Terms or other agreements or guidelines, (ii) requests by law
          enforcement or other government or regulatory authorities or (iii) violation or
          unauthorized use of copyrights or other intellectual property. Cancellation or
          termination of your account, services or subscriptions by the Company shall not relieve
          you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges. You may not access or use the
          Company Sites and Materials after termination or notification of the same.
The arbitration shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association
          (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes. The AAA Rules are
          available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration
          shall be conducted before a single arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or
          amount, the relief allowed by the applicable law.  This agreement is governed by the
          Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state in which you
          reside without reference to its choice of laws principles. The arbitrator shall decide
          all issues of interpretation and application of this arbitration provision. For any
          arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert
          witness fees, are $5,000 or less (“Small Claim”), the arbitrator may, if you prevail,
          award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs as part of any
          award, but may not grant TLC Media LLC its attorney fees, expert witness fees or costs
          unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. Upon filing of the
          arbitration demand in a Small Claim case, TLC Media LLC will pay all filing,
          administrative, and arbitrator fees. Administrative, filing, and arbitrator fees for
          arbitrations in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert
          witness fees, exceed $5,000 (“Large Claim”) shall be determined according to AAA rules.
          In a Large Claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or apportion
          among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs. Judgment
          may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
This arbitration provision also applies to claims against TLC Media LLC's employees,
          representatives and affiliates if any such claim arises from the Terms or the Product's
          sale, condition or performance.
You may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to TLC Media
          LLC no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the first consumer purchaser's
          purchase of the Product. To opt out, you must send notice by e-mail to
          support@profit.ly, with the subject line: “Arbitration Opt Out.” You must include in
          the opt out e-mail (a) your name, address and email address used in connection with the
          Service and (b) the data on which you began using the Service.
Advice of Counsel. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH
          PARTY HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND HAS
          READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT
          SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.
14.	CLASS ACTION WAIVER
ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL
          BASIS AND SHALL NOT BE COMBINED OR CONSOLIDATED AS A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER
          REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and
          us that any part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to some
          claims, the arbitration agreement and Class Action Waiver will not apply to those
          claims only but will remain in force with respect to all other claims.

Last Revised: December 27, 2019
Nothing in this Privacy Statement may be construed to create any obligation for the Company beyond what is required by applicable law.
California residents click here to access our California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) Notice.
This Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement" or "Statement") describes the practices of TLC Media LLC ("TLC Media," "TLC," "Company," "we" or "us") with respect to information, including Personal Data (which means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person), we obtain from and about individuals interacting with us and our websites, mobile applications, products and services (collectively, our "Services"). This Statement does not apply to job applicants or Company employees.
This Privacy Statement only applies to the data processing activities of TLC Media. This Privacy Statement does not apply to services, websites or mobile apps offered by third parties, even if this site links to those services or third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of every third party website that collects your Personal Data.
Please read the information below to learn about the information, including Personal Data, collected about you and how it is used. Please note that there is a separate
Terms of Service found at the hyperlink located at the bottom of our site.
If we make any material changes to this Statement we will notify you by means of a prominent notice on our site prior to the change becoming effective. The most current version of the Statement may be reviewed by clicking on the "Privacy Statement" link located at the bottom of our site.
1.	Information We Collect
The type of information, including Personal Data, we collect depends on how you use our Services or interact with us.
Sources of Personal Data
Information, including Personal Data, is collected directly from you when you:
Register for an account;
Communicate with us, such as to provide feedback, request support, or ask for additional information;
Subscribe to newsletters, register for seminars or training, or purchase goods or services;
Use interactive or social networking features of our Services, including setting up a public profile, submitting content (such as comments, articles, links, or other items), or using our chat feature; or
Otherwise interact with or use our Services.
TLC Media also collects information, including Personal Data, from our affiliated entities. For example, you may sign up for newsletters with one of our affiliates and in so doing choose to receive information from us as well.
In addition, TLC Media receives information, including Personal Data, from third parties who provide services to us. This information may include information about your use of our Services, your use of other websites as well as your interests and preferences. For example, we may collect information about your browsing and usage history on this site. We may combine the information we obtain from third parties with information that we or our affiliates have collected about you.
Categories of Personal Data
The Personal Data collected (electronically, in writing, or by phone) includes:
Contact information (such as name, email address, mailing address and phone numbers);
Payment information (including credit card information, billing address and bank account information);
Purchase or product/service use history;
Account log-in credentials;
Your interests;
Demographic information (such as number in household, information on your income and
          assets, age, etc.);
Photographs, images, video and other user-generated content such as materials that you may submit for contests or sweepstakes; and
Data gathered by technology when you visit our site.
California Do Not Track Disclosures (Automatically Collected Information)
Like most website operators, we collect information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as your IP address, your browser type, information regarding your internet service provider or the type of device you used to access this website, language preference, pages visited, and the date and time of each page request. Some of this information may be considered Personal Data under applicable laws.  Some of this data may also be sent to third-party content providers (for example: advertisers, website analytic companies, etc.) that provide content on our Services. Such sharing may allow the website and/or content providers to track you over time and across multiple websites. At this time, our site does not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins as there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret Do Not Track signals from browsers. Additionally, if you navigated from or navigate to other websites from our site, we may collect the address of those websites.
We may collect information about your activities on this site through the use of cookies, clear gifs or web beacons, local shared objects or Flash cookies, or through other identifiers or technologies, including similar technologies as they may evolve over time. We refer to these technologies collectively as Data Technologies. We use Data Technologies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our Services, and their website access preferences.
We may allow third parties to use Data Technologies on our site. The information collected from these Data Technologies may be shared with and used by us, by others acting on our behalf, or by third parties. Information collected by Data Technologies may be used on this website or on other websites, services, or online applications, including websites that may not be operated by us. For example, we may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. These ad-network partners use Data Technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. These websites and third-party ad networks are not controlled by us.
You may be able to restrict our use of certain Data Technologies, such as cookies, by modifying your browser settings. For example, your web browser may enable you to refuse cookies. By restricting our use of Data Technologies, certain features of our Services may not function properly.
