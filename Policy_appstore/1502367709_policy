Please note, these terms and conditions reflect the full service offered by Boostworks People Engagement Limited (“BW”).
Please note, some features referenced in these terms and conditions may not apply to the Platform You have access to.
Privacy Notice
We respect Your privacy and are committed to protecting Your personal information. Our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these terms and conditions by reference, outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Your personal information. By using the Platform, You consent to the collection and use of Your personal information as outlined in our
Privacy Policy
.
Acceptance of Terms
By using this Platform, You acknowledge that You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms and conditions, as well as any additional terms and conditions that may apply to specific sections or services of the Platform. We reserve the right to modify or amend these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Platform after any such changes constitutes Your acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.
Terms and Conditions
The Platform is controlled, operated, and administered by Boostworks People Engagement Limited, Company Number No 04516741, whose registered office is at Victor House, Wheatley Business Centre, Old London Road, Wheatley, Oxford, OX33 1XW, VAT Reg No 805 4597 19 ("BW", "We", "Us" or "Our") from its offices within the United Kingdom.
BW makes no representation that materials within the Platform are appropriate or available for use at other locations outside of the United Kingdom and access to the Platform from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited. If You access the Platform from locations outside of the UK, You are responsible for compliance with all local laws. These terms and conditions of use shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.
Due to the nature of the Internet, we do not always promise full and error free operation of this Platform.
These terms and conditions ("Terms") do not affect Your statutory rights.
To order goods through the Platform You must be at least 18 years of age and accept delivery within the UK. We will treat each order for goods as an offer by You to purchase the goods subject to these Terms.
Please note all activity and orders placed through the Platform are subject to fraud prevention and security checks.
User Accounts
To access features or services on the Platform, You will be required to create a user account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep Your account information updated. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your account credentials, and You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your account. You must notify our customer service team by emailing
help@boostworks.co.uk
immediately of any unauthorised use of Your account.
BW reserves the right to close Your account if You are deemed, at Our sole discretion, to be attempting to defraud, deceive or any misuse of the Services or in any other unacceptable manner. Your account will also be closed if You leave Your employer or association or affinity sponsoring the scheme, or You are in breach of these terms and conditions. Once the closure process is complete, You will no longer be able to access Your Account or the other benefits associated with the Services and any monetary balance in Your Account would be deemed to be forfeited.
We take Our responsibility for looking after the security of Your Account and Our Service very seriously. Occasionally We need to carry out a "Know Your Customer" or "KYC" check. This check forms part of Our standard fraud and anti-money laundering prevention processes. We will temporarily close Your Account and send You an email which requires You to send us proof of Your identity to
checkin@boostworks.co.uk
so that We can validate Your identity. Upon validating Your identity, We will re-open Your Account.
Formation of Contract
For the avoidance of doubt, when purchasing from BW, we will consider a contract to have been made upon receipt of an order from You once we have established the availability of the goods and the price. If there is any discrepancy from the information shown on the Platform You will be informed.  If there is no discrepancy and payment has been taken the contract will be formed.  You will be informed by e-mail that payment has been taken.
Should an inaccuracy of the information on the Platform be discovered following receipt of Your order, You will be informed and You may decide whether to cancel or confirm the order. Once Your order has been processed Your contract will be binding provided when paying using points that Your Points balance is found to be correct prior to delivery. If the Points balance is incorrect the order will be void. If You have insufficient funds in your Account Balance to pay for the value of the order, We will request the order to be paid by debit card. Only personal UK registered debit cards may be used on the Scheme.
Some products and services You may have access to by using the Platform have conditions that apply in addition to these conditions: When purchasing from our Retailer partners additional conditions may be displayed within the appropriate Retailer's web page and You should read those carefully before You agree to use the product/service in question. If there are any inconsistencies between these Terms and the Retailer's product/service conditions, the Retailer's product/service conditions will prevail in relation to the products and services provided by the Retailer. You may be required to register with the Retailer to enable You to access the Retailer's Platform and to obtain the manufacturers warranties.
Description of Goods
Some of the products we sell are of a technical nature and it is not practical to publish detailed specifications of all the products. All images, descriptive matter, specifications, and advertising on our site are for the sole purpose of giving an approximate description of the goods. Full detailed specifications are available from the manufacturer's brochures or their Platforms. You should examine the specifications carefully to satisfy Yourself that You are purchasing what You require.
Accuracy of Product Information
All product specifications, images and other information published on our Platform have either been made accessible by suppliers, manufacturers, publications, publicists, or been gathered from public domain sources. Our intention is that all information on the Platform should be as accurate and up to date as possible. However, BW cannot guarantee the reliability, or the accuracy of the information contained within its pages. Should an inaccuracy be discovered prior to contracting, if possible, You will be informed, and You may decide whether to cancel or confirm the order. We may monitor or record calls between You and BW's support team to confirm that Your instructions have been carried out correctly and to help improve the quality of service. If You decide to buy any of these products or services, You do so at Your own risk and as a result of Your own choice. We are not a party to any dealings You have with Third Parties - these are Your direct responsibility.
Payment and Price
The total price payable for the goods will be stipulated at the time You place Your order. We are entitled to adjust the price to take account of any increase in our supplier's prices, or the imposition of any taxes or duties, or if due to an error or omission the price published for the goods is wrong, prior to contracting. If there is any reason to change the price for the goods ordered, You will be informed prior to contracting so that You either cancel or confirm the order.
All prices on our Platform are inclusive, where applicable, of VAT but exclusive of delivery charges and or special delivery charges which will be payable as indicated at the time of placing Your order.
When purchasing using rewards You may purchase goods and services to the value of Your Account Balance. Should the goods exceed the value of Your Account Balance You may, if Your reward programme administrator allows, pay the balance of the price using Your personal debit card which is registered to You in the UK. If You are using Your debit card to pay the balance on an order You must provide BW with Your exact billing address and telephone number, that is, the address and phone number Your debit card issuing bank has on file for You. Incorrect information will cause a delay in processing or cancellation of Your order. Your order will only be processed, and goods despatched (subject to availability) once authorisation of Your debit card has been properly received and processed.
Ordering Items
If Your basket only contains discount items and You opt to pay for the items using a debit card, You will save a percentage of the value – as stated on the Platform – which will be credited to Your Account Balance. The amount You are due to save will display in the basket and will be credited to Your Balance as soon as the transaction is successful.
If Your basket contains a combination of reward and discount items, and You choose to use a debit or credit card to pay for the order, You will save a percentage of the value of the discount item(s). You will not save any money from the reward item(s) as discounts are not offered for these items.
Items paid for in part or full using Your Balance do not qualify for a saving or discount. If Your basket contains a combination of reward and discount items, and You choose to use all or part of Your Balance to pay for the order, You will not save anything on the discount item. If You choose to follow this payment method, Your Balance will not be credited with a saving of any kind.

DISCOUNTS
Reloadable Gift Cards
You may order Reloadable Retailer Gift Cards via our Platform. Once You receive the cards You will need to activate each one by registering them online on our Platform and, in some instances, You will also need to register with the retail partner whose card You have ordered. This will be indicated on the Reloadable Gift Card wallet and email You receive. On loading funds onto a Reloadable Gift Card, the price that You will pay will be as advertised on the Platform. Any Discount amounts and fees may be changed from time-to-time at our discretion and without notice.
For new card orders, we will send You the Reloadable Gift Card You have chosen and You will need to activate following receipt. We will only initiate funds loaded onto activated cards, and we will do so as soon as possible and normally within 24 hours from activation. For all subsequent loads onto Reloadable Cards, we will endeavour to load money soon after Your order is processed, and normally within 24 hours. The time taken for the load to be spendable on the card will vary by retailer with some being immediate and others taking up to 4 working days. We reserve the right, however, to cancel and/or delay the processing of any Order if we suspect or believe that there is suspicious or irregular activity taking place on Your Account.
Please note Reloadable Gift Card orders are non-refundable.
Instant Vouchers
Some vouchers available through the Platform are delivered in digital or electronic format and known as “Instant Vouchers”. If You order an Instant Voucher, this will be delivered to You by email to the email address You have registered on the Platform. Instant Vouchers (except for discounted cinema tickets) will also be placed in Your Digital Wallet and Messages area on the Platform where they can be retrieved at any time. We will endeavour to send Your Orders soon after Your order is processed, and normally within 24 hours. We reserve the right, however, to cancel and/or delay the processing of any Order if we suspect or believe that there is suspicious or irregular activity taking place on Your Account.
Please note Instant Voucher orders are non-refundable.
Online Purchasing
You can order products online direct with BW or third party Retailers linked through Our Platform. You will be offered either Cashback, a discount or a special price offered on the Retailer Platform. If You choose to purchase through a Retailer which is offering Cashback, You will be able to see the transaction through the Account Balance feature on Our Platform as set out in the process below in the Cashback section.
Your Cashback
Where orders are placed with third party Retailers offering Cashback, the service tracks Your payment and relies on third party systems used by the Retailer over which We have no control. The Cashback value should appear in Your Balance once we have received the Cashback from the retailer. This will normally be within 30 working days but can take up to 3 months to be allocated back to You. BW accepts no liability for failure in the tracking process on third party systems. Cashback may be affected by certain settings or software products installed on a computer which prevent the Retailer from tracking Your actions or the Retailer refusing to pay Cashback. If a technical failure on the part of the Retailer, or an incompatibility with the settings on a computer, prevents the Retailer from tracking the qualifying action or for some other reason we do not receive the Cashback, then We reserve the right not to allocate Cashback to your Balance.
We provide features on the Platform for You to check that Your Cashback will be correctly tracked and added to Your Balance, and it is Your responsibility to ensure that You check Your Balance regularly.
If You report to BW within 45 days of a qualifying action taking place that the action has not been reported by the Retailer, then BW will contact the Retailer on Your behalf to try and recover the funds. In no circumstances should You contact the Retailer directly to try and obtain missing Cashback payments. BW may choose to make a goodwill payment in some circumstances, but this is absolutely at BW's sole discretion.
All Cashback payments are subject to BW receiving payment from the Retailer. Cashback in Your Balance has a nominal cash value of £0.00001 for every £1.00 of Cashback.
Unless expressly stated, Cashback payments into Your Balance are only available on purchases completed online. No Cashback will be paid on phone or post orders. Orders placed online that are later completed or revised by phone are also not eligible for Cashback. In these circumstances You are advised to cancel the order and place a new order online.
If You return an item or cancel a subscription before Your obligations with the Retailer are complete, then no Cashback will be awarded, and Cashback already credited to Your Balance will be removed. If You receive a Cashback payment that You are not eligible to receive, You must inform Us by contacting our support team at
help@boostworks.co.uk
at the earliest opportunity so that the transaction can be corrected.
Cashback is only available from Retailers’ Platforms that are visited directly via a hypertext link from the Platform. If You follow a hypertext link to one Retailer, then from that Retailer follow a hypertext link to another Retailer listed on our Cashback supplier site, without visiting the second Retailer directly from that Platform, Cashback will not be tracked or awarded.
Cashback amounts are published for guidance purposes only. We reserve the right to change or withdraw Cashback rates at any time and without notice. Amendments will be posted to the Platform as soon as possible. Current rates are displayed on the Platform and are available by contacting our support team. It is Your responsibility to check current rates before making a purchase. We reserve the right to cancel or amend any Cashback that, at Our sole discretion, is deemed by us to have been awarded in error.
BW will not be liable for incorrectly published Cashback amounts, nor will We be liable for any payment to You resulting from an incorrectly published Cashback amount.
In the event of a technical, administrative, or other error that results in the Balance in Your account exceeding the correct value, then You must inform Us at the earliest opportunity. The status codes of Cashback payments in Your Balance are for guidance only and represent BW's then current understanding of the status of the payment.
You can only redeem Your Cashback once the accrued Balance exceeds £10.00 and only on items advertised on our Platform. The price You will pay will be the face value of the item[s] as advertised on the Platform and You will not be entitled to any discounts and/or Cashback on such purchases.
Cashback in Your Balance - which is the value in your Balance that has been accrued from using Retailer offers - can be transferred out to a bank account of your choice once the accrued Balance exceeds £10.00.
Any Cashback credited to Your Balance has a validity period of 12 months from the date of issue. After 12 months, any unspent Cashback in Your Balance will expire and be removed from Your Balance as it expires on a First in First Out (FIFO) basis.
If Your account remains “Inactive” - meaning You have not accessed Your account using Your credentials or been passed through from another service (single sign on) and/or Your Balance has remained dormant for period of 12 months - Your account will be closed and the money in Your Balance will expire and will be deemed to be forfeited.
You are not permitted to spend funds gained from Cashback payments that You know You are not eligible to receive. Knowingly spending ineligible funds constitutes fraud. BW reserves the right to take legal and/or other remedies to recover these amounts.
Paper Vouchers
Paper Vouchers ("Vouchers") means any physical retail gift vouchers purchased on the Platform. For all physical Voucher orders, You may be asked at the Checkout if You wish to cover the loss of the vouchers in transit by using special (insured) delivery, if You do not take this option and Your Vouchers are lost in the post, You will not get a refund or be reissued with replacement vouchers. All postage and processing costs will be clearly stated at the Checkout.
You may return a complete order for Vouchers up to 14 working days from the despatch of Your order. It is Your responsibility to pay the postage on all returns except where Vouchers have been sent in error. We do not accept responsibility for returns lost in transit. We strongly recommend all returns are be sent by tracked or recorded delivery mail. Before returning Your Vouchers please contact Our support team at
help@boostworks.co.uk
to get a Returns Authorisation Number (“RAN”). Returns cannot be accepted unless they have been previously approved.
Voucher refunds will be credited on receipt of the returned and unredeemed Vouchers using the same payment method that was used to purchase the Vouchers.
After a period of 14 working days, We do not offer a returns service for Vouchers that are no longer required so please ensure that You only order the amount and type of Vouchers that You need.
Outside of the 14 working day period after receiving Your Vouchers, We are unable to accept returns or issue refunds for any reason including where a retailer has stopped accepting a particular Vouchers or ceased trading since the purchase was made. You should only order Vouchers that You intend to spend soon after receiving them.
If You do not receive Your Vouchers, please ensure You contact our support team within 21 days of Your order so that We can investigate any lost or misplaced Vouchers. We cannot guarantee a re-issue or refund of Your Vouchers outside of this 21-day period.
Voucher availability and postage rates are subject to change at any time and without notice. Our support team can provide current information on Vouchers and available rates. All orders are subject to fraud prevention and security checks. We take all reasonable care to ensure there are no errors, but we reserve the right to refuse an order where an error has occurred or for any other reason.
BW endeavour to ensure the correct despatch of Vouchers. BW cannot accept responsibility for any loss, liability, claim, damage, expense or cost whether as a consequence of negligence or otherwise arising in connection with an order placed with the Vouchers provider.
In the event of a failure to deliver Vouchers in time for You to make the intended use of them or to benefit from a planned purchase, Our liability is limited to providing a refund in full for the Vouchers if they are returned to us in accordance with these Terms.
The issuer of the Vouchers will account for tax under the face value voucher provisions in Schedule 10A VAT Act 1994.
Local Discounts
Your service may include a Local Discount Card. This card can be used to provide a discount or value-added offer when used at participating merchants across the UK. The service provides a feature which allows You to see what merchants in Your local physical location will accept the Local Discount Card and the offers available. Whilst BW make every effort to ensure the Local Discount offers remain available, from time-to-time offers may change and merchants withdraw from the Local Discount service. In the event of non-acceptance of the Local Discount Card at the merchant please contact our support team at
help@boostworks.co.uk
and provide the name of the merchant, the offer advertised and the time of the transaction. BW will investigate and provide a response to You in a timely manner.
Paperless Direct Debit
The service provides You the opportunity to set up regular payments to ensure that Your Reloadable Gift Cards are loaded so that You can benefit from the savings offered at the Retailers that You use regularly through setting up a regular Direct Debit Instruction. You can set up the paperless Direct Debit through BW by completing the forms on the system. You can alter the amount and choice of Reloadable Gift Cards that You load. There are certain situations where You may be required to send in a paper copy, where the account is in joint names, or You are not the account holder. You are at liberty to cancel the Direct Debit by notification to Your bank or building society. If You provide any information about another person, You should ensure that You have their consent to do so. This Direct Debit Instruction complies with the latest Direct Debit rules and guidelines published by Pay.uk and will be updated to ensure it complies to any changes in those regulations including the Direct Debit Guarantee for each account holder. Reloadable Gift Cards will only be credited once we have received cleared funds from Your Bank under the terms of the Direct Debit Instruction.
Fuel Card
Through the Platform You may be offered the option to purchase a Fuel Card for an annual fee - “Card Issuing Fee”. On receipt of Your application, completion of the Direct debit instruction and payment of the Card Issuing Fee, You will be sent a Fuel Card in the post. Once activated, the Fuel Card can be used to purchase fuel at participating fuel stations across the UK under the terms which will be sent to You with the Fuel Card. You will be asked to provide Your bank details when ordering the card to enable BW to set up a paperless Direct Debit from Your bank account to collect the charges incurred by You for the fuel purchased.
The charges relating to the service includes the Card Issuing Fee and transactional cost incurred by BW. The fuel card service offers a geo-location map, which provides You detailed information on which fuel station will accept the Fuel Card. Each week You will be emailed a “Fixed Fee” for Petrol or Diesel which will be the price at which You will be able to purchase Fuel for the next 7-day period using the Fuel Card. The charges relating to fuel purchased will be calculated based on the number of litres of fuel You purchased at the weekly Fixed Fee and not the advertised pump price at the location where the fuel was purchased. The charges that You have incurred will be collected by Direct Debit weekly for the previous week’s fuel purchased and the process repeats every 7 days.
If You have misplaced Your Fuel Card or it has been lost or stolen, You must inform our support team immediately at
help@boostworks.co.uk
. Your Fuel Card will then be cancelled and will not be able to be used.
If You report to us that Your Fuel Card has been misplaced or stolen, BW will not accept any responsibility for Charges incurred on Your Fuel Card before the date and time BW has confirmed that the Fuel Card has been cancelled, subject to any accrued fuel purchased that is not recorded at the time of suspension.
If BW are unable to collect payment from the Direct Debit for fuel that You have purchased using the Fuel Card, Our support team will then contact You to take an alternative form of payment. BW reserve the right to cancel any Fuel Card because of a missed payment indefinitely. If agreed with Your employer and You, You are unable to pay for Your fuel by means of a Direct Debit or an alternative payment method, then You agree that BW will instruct Your employer to make a net deduction from Your next salary payment to the value of the outstanding payment.
If You use Your Fuel Card to pay for premium Petrol or Diesel fuel, a surcharge may apply.
The maximum value of fuel You can purchase using Your Fuel Card per month is £500.
The payment reference on Your bank statement for Your Fuel Card Direct Debit will display as "PSL re Boostworks People Engagement Limited".

                    cost of calls may vary so please check with your provider for exact

Usability
To make the site as usable as we can, we have introduced a number of features that
                    will make it easier for you to find your way around:
Breadcrumb trails - Always know where in the structure of the website the page
                        you are looking at is located.
Consistent presentation - The site is built from a number of templates,
                        offering consistency as you use the site.
Accessibility
In order to ensure the information presented to the public is accessible, we try
                    to make sure of the following:
All content images used in this site include descriptive ALT attributes. Purely
                        decorative graphics include null ALT attributes.
Tables are used purely for presenting data, not for formatting content. Where they
                        are used, Captions and Column Headers are included.
Wherever possible we will provide documents in an HTML format for viewing online
                        with web browsers or using assistive technologies such as screen readers.
Visual design
This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout. This offers benefits in
                    terms of accessibility, although the differing manner in which web browsers interpret
                    style sheets may lead to some minor formatting errors. If your browser or browsing
                    device does not support stylesheets at all, the content of each page should still
                    readable.
This site uses only relative font sizes, which means you are able to alter the font
                    sizes to suit your preference (for example, Internet Explorer users can alter their
                    text size by going to the Text menu).
