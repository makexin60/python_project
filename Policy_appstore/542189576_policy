Privacy policy
Introduction
This is the Privacy Policy of Clare Community Radio Holdings PLC trading as Clare FM, which operates as a local service independent broadcaster based in Ennis, Co. Clare. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to outline Clare FM’s policy concerning the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of Personal Data which is gathered and processed by Clare FM. This Privacy Policy also sets out Clare FM information management practices.
Clare FM respects the privacy of all those individuals whose Personal Data it encounters, which includes the following:
A. all users of the Clare FM website (i.e. the Clare FM desktop and mobile sites), Clare FM social media pages and apps and other Clare FM services (whether on-air or online);
B. Clare FM employees and contractors (including applicants for employment with Clare FM);
C. all members (including former employees) of Clare FM sponsored pension schemes;
D. Clare FM business contacts and suppliers; and
E. Individuals whose Personal Data is provided to Clare FM in the form of content for editorial, content creation, journalistic purposes (including those who contribute content for live discussion or other purposes including audience participation).
For each of these categories of individuals, this Privacy Policy will explain why Clare FM collects and how Clare FM uses the Personal Data it collects. Clare FM will ensure that it keeps all Personal Data provided to it in accordance with Clare FM’s obligations under applicable data protection laws. Clare FM will update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any material changes in technology, legislation or Clare FM’s data use practices which may materially affect the way in which Clare FM processes Personal Data.
This is not an exhaustive statement of all Clare FM’s data protection practices and Clare FM may apply specific policies within certain environments. Clare FM might include a separate privacy notice at the point of capturing data on a new service and any specific consents obtained or information provided in this way will apply specifically to that service and will supplement this Policy. Clare FM may also introduce additional user choices on our digital platforms which will be clearly explained to users as required by data protection law.
What is Personal Data?
Personal Data is any information relating to a living individual that allows for the identification of that individual. Personal Data can include a name, address, contact details, an identification number, IP address, CCTV footage, accesses cards/co-tags, audio-visual or audio recordings of a person, details about an individual’s location or any other detail(s) specific to that individual.
In circumstances where Clare FM controls Personal Data by deciding why and how that Personal Data is processed, Clare FM will be a “Data Controller”. Any entity that processes Personal Data controlled by Clare FM and does so on behalf of Clare FM, is a “Data Processor”. Data Processors may include third party service providers engaged by Clare FM (for example communications providers, payroll and marketing or recruitment agencies). As required by applicable data protection law, when Clare FM appoints a Data Processor, we will ensure that appropriate contractual protections are in place.
In circumstances where content is produced independently of Clare FM, the third-party producer shall usually be the Data Controller, and as such, it is the privacy policy of such third-party producers that will govern the collection and processing of Personal Data. Where content is co-produced, Clare FM and the third-party producer may be Joint Data Controllers. In such situations, it may be necessary for Clare FM to share Personal Data with the third-party producer and vice versa.
Clare FM Website, Social Media and Apps
This section of the Privacy Policy sets out the type of Personal Data collected by Clare FM, the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected and processed and the lawful justifications for such processing in the context of the Clare FM website (https://www.clare.fm) & App (Clare FM App).
Clare FM is not responsible for the privacy practices of any external websites, device manufacturers or platforms which may be accessed or used in connection with a person’s use of the Clare FM website, Clare FM social media pages or App. They are subject to their own privacy statements which may materially differ from those of Clare FM so users should review them for further information.

If such inappropriate content is posted to a social media page that Clare FM controls you can report it
at the following address dpo@clare.fm and Clare FM will endeavour to ensure that appropriate action is taken in accordance with the Clare FM policies and the policies of the relevant social media platforms.

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies” as outlined above. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
You can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Other third-party cookies such as those from YouTube, Google and double click.com are also in use to enhance your experience on the site and to help us tailor content to our user’s needs.
We further use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behaviour of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences.

Clare FM may also verify the location of a user’s device while using the app or country of the relevant Appstore registered credit or debit card. Clare FM may block usage of the app in some cases based upon this information. This is because there may be territorial restrictions on the use of certain content.
