Sensitive information
Every now and then, we might ask you for information that may seem sensitive. We’ll only ask for this when we really need to.
For example, we might need to use facial or voice recognition technology to identify you and protect your account from fraud. As part of our regulatory obligations, we might have to ask you if you have any criminal convictions. Or, if you tell us about a health issue or a difficult situation you’re in, we might ask for more information so that we can make any adjustments to your account that you might need.
How do you use my information?
We have to have a valid reason for using your information. This is called the ‘lawful basis for processing’.
How we use your information – and the lawful basis for using it – depends on the type of information we collect and the reason we collect it.
To operate as a bank
This includes:
operating bank accounts and allowing you to make and receive payments (including through digital services like GooglePay, ApplePay, SamsungPay, GarminPay, and Click to Pay)

Using sensitive information
We need a second lawful basis to be able to process sensitive information. This could include:
if you or someone acting on your behalf has given us clear and informed consent
to protect someone’s life
if we’re carrying out a task to protect or improve your financial wellbeing, or to prevent illegal activity
if it’s in relation to legal claims
Who do you share my information with?
There are certain organisations we might need to share your information with so we can do the things set out in the 'How do you use my information' section above. This includes:
Organisations we work and connect with
Affiliated companies, including companies within our group
Partners, suppliers, subcontractors
Social media platforms
Fraud prevention suppliers and analytics providers
Google Maps and Google Earth
When you use Google Maps and Google Earth, you have to follow the Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Service. This includes Google’s privacy policy, which you can read at
https://policies.google.com/privacy
.
Organisations you can choose to give us permission to share with
Open Banking providers you use
Marketplace partners you use
Organisations who’ve integrated with us through our API
Other banks in connection with services we offer
Organisations that help to protect against fraud and reduce credit risk
Credit reference agencies

For more information about how credit reference and fraud prevention agencies use your information, you can read their privacy policies at the following websites:
Credit reference agencies
https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain
https://www.equifax.co.uk/privacy-hub/crain
http://www.experian.co.uk/crain/
Fraud prevention agencies
https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn
https://www.synectics-solutions.com/privacy-policy
https://www.napier.ai/privacy-policy
Our websites and app might sometimes contain links to the websites or apps of organisations we work and connect with. These websites and apps have their own privacy policies and we’re not responsible or liable for these. Please check their policies before you submit any information to these websites or apps
Do you make automated decisions about me?
We use systems to help us make certain decisions. We decide the level of automated decision-making we need on a case-by-case basis.
We use systems to help us make decisions on things like:
whether to give you an account, or if a product or service is relevant for you
detecting fraud or money-laundering, and taking action against it
To help us make these decisions, we use information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, as well as facial and voice recognition tools.
We also use credit scoring systems to help us decide whether to give you an overdraft, or offer you a higher overdraft limit. These systems work by taking into account information from credit reference agencies as well as information we already hold about you, and analysing how much money we can responsibly lend to you. They’re regularly reviewed to check they stay fair and effective.
If your application for an account, product or service is declined, you can ask for it to be reviewed in full by a human. To do this, send us a message in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not.
Do you apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to my data?
We use artificial intelligence as part of us operating as a bank (for example, during the account application process). We use it to extract information from your application and help us understand if we’re able to offer you an account or service.
We might also use machine learning:
to prevent fraud
to transcribe calls you have with us, or identify if you’ve asked us to access your personal information – we do this for training and quality purposes so we can improve the service we give our customers
for other reasons from time to time, as long as we don’t use machine learning on its own to make a decision
How do you store my information and do you transfer it anywhere?
Where we can, we store and process your information using servers in the UK and European Economic Area (EEA). The servers are secure, and very few people have access to them. All your information stored on these servers is also encrypted, which makes it impossible for anyone who isn't authorised to read it.
The only times your information might go outside the UK and EEA are:
if a supplier has to store or process it elsewhere, which only applies to a very small number of our suppliers. We try to avoid this, but when it does happen we put safeguards in place to help keep your information secure.
if you’re outside the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages, or you’re in the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages to other places. If this happens, your information will be stored and processed in line with the countries’ own regulations, which might not be as rigorous as those in the UK and EEA.
We have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to protect your information. Although we’ll always do our best to keep it safe once it reaches us, we’re not responsible if anything happens to it before that point.
How long do you hold my information for?
We usually keep your information for six years from the date you stop using Starling products or services, which is the minimum the law says we have to keep it for.
What are my rights?
The right to access
You have the right to access information we hold about you. To do this, send us a message in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not.
The right to update
You have the right to update information we hold about you so it’s correct. You can update your address, email address, and phone number in the app. To update any other details, get in touch with us.
We’ll also check in with you every year to make sure the information we hold about you is up-to-date.
The right to delete
You have the right to ask us to delete your information, but we might not always be able to for legal reasons. For example, if you’re applying to open an account and we’ve started checks with a credit reference agency, we have to keep your information to comply with the law and other regulations.
We’ll delete your information if you ask us to, unless:
we need to keep it for any of the reasons set out in the
How do you use my information?
section
we’re not reasonably able to permanently delete it
you’ve shared the information for use on our website – this might stay publicly available
you’ve shared the information with other companies, like our Marketplace partners – their own privacy policies will apply
To ask us to delete your information, send us a message in the app or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
.
The right to restrict processing
You can ask us to limit how we use your information. To do this, send us a message in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not.
We’ll do what you ask, unless:
we need to use it for any of the reasons set out in the
How do you use my information?
section
you’ve shared the information for use on our website – this might stay publicly available
you’ve shared the information with other companies, like our Marketplace partners – their own privacy policies will apply
The right to object
You can ask us to stop using all or some of your information. To do this, send us a message in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not.
We’ll stop using the information you ask us to, unless:
we need to use it for any of the reasons set out in the
How do you use my information?
section
you’ve shared the information for use on our website – this might stay publicly available
you’ve shared the information with other companies, like our Marketplace partners – their own privacy policies will apply
If you’ve consented to receiving marketing communications, you can withdraw this consent at any time. To do this, you can update your marketing preferences in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not. Any updates might not take effect immediately, so you might still get marketing communications from us for a short time afterwards.
The right to transfer
You can ask us to transfer information about you that you’ve given us to somewhere else. To do this, send us a message in the app if you’re a customer, or email us at
privacy@starlingbank.com
if you’re not.
We’ll usually transfer your information, but
there are some reasons we might not be able to
we might have to keep a copy of it
Either of these things might happen for any of the reasons set out in the
How do you use my information?
section.
We’ll usually respond to any requests relating to these rights within one calendar month. But if we receive several requests from you, or your request is complex or involves a lot of information, we might need up to three months to get back to you.
How do I make a complaint?
If you think we’ve broken data protection laws when it comes to your information, you can make a complaint. To do this, send an email with your name and details of your complaint to
privacy@starlingbank.com
. We’ll then investigate and let you know the outcome.
If you’re unhappy with the outcome, you can raise a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). For more information about the ICO, visit

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN)
This privacy notice, produced with Experian and Transunion (the other key CRAs), explains how personal data is processed for core credit referencing activities. This often relates to personal data that has not been collected directly from the individual.
Download CRAIN PDF
Version: 1.2 - Adopted: 2 December 2024
IN BRIEF
We (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, collectively referred to as “we” and “us” throughout this Privacy Notice) are credit reference agencies and we play an important role in the UK’s financial ecosystem. This Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (referred to as “this Privacy Notice”) explains how we collect, process and share personal data about consumers and businesses (referred to as “you”).
This section briefly summarises the key processing activities common to all of us. For more detail, please refer to the rest of this document. We recommend reviewing each credit reference agency’s own privacy notices, which explain the specific processing activities of that credit reference agency. Links to these documents can be found in
Section 14
.
Throughout this Privacy Notice, where we use “data” we mean the data types as described in
Section 4
.
What do Credit Reference Agencies do?
We collect information about you from various sources and build databases that hold this data.
We need to hold relevant permissions from the Financial Conduct Authority to collect and share this financial information about you.
Where do Credit Reference Agencies get information from?
The primary source of information we collect is from public records, such as court judgments (CCJs) and electoral register information, financial information from financial account providers, and information generated by us based on the information received and/or our own analytical research.
In addition, we may also collect information from payment accounts via the use of open banking, gambling organisations, employers, utilities suppliers, telecoms businesses as well as (business data only) from publicly available business websites.
Who uses the information, and what do they use it for?
Financial account providers and other organisations carry out searches against information with one or more of us.
Organisations can carry out searches for several reasons. These include assessing creditworthiness and ability to afford financial products, checking the accuracy of other information, preventing and detecting crime (such as fraud or money laundering), checking identity, locating individuals (for example to recover debts that they owe), calculating how much their insurance premiums should be, employment verification, including assessing their suitability for a job or a tenancy, and helping to protect individuals from the impacts of problem gambling.
When an organisation carries out a search of someone’s data, we will record details of that search. This is known as a search footprint. Depending on the type of search they can be visible to the individual and/or to other organisations that may conduct searches on that individual. Some organisations may draw adverse inference from the presence of some search footprints, for example if a person has multiple debt collection searches recorded.
We link people who appear to be financially associated, for example, through a joint account, joint application for credit or a joint County Court Judgment. This information on financial associates may be checked by companies when undertaking credit searches for the purposes of assessing credit risk. This is because your link with financial associates may affect your ability to repay debt.
Examples of this include, acting as guarantor for a personal loan that another individual is taking out, or in the capacity as a director or business owner, where the relevant business is applying for a commercial loan. See the table in
Section 4
for further information on how the financial associate’s data affects your credit report and score.
We also use some data for marketing-related purposes. Each of us provide different marketing services, to help organisations to better direct their marketing to consumers and (where relevant) business owners and directors, for example excluding individuals from advertising for credit products they would not be eligible for. We may also use the data to predict information or characteristics about the population, to inform product and marketing strategy, to help organisations identify who they want to market their products and services to, and how they should be delivered.
The data relating to you held by each of us might be different. This is because not every financial account provider supplies data to every one of us.
What else do Credit Reference Agencies do with my information?
We also use the data in our databases for other activities, including analytics and profiling. This can help financial account providers build scorecards to use in assessing credit applications.
We carry out several types of data processing to help achieve the aims described above. These include loading data, matching and linking data together, generating credit scores, as well as testing, developing and building products and services for our clients.
Individuals have certain rights that they can exercise in relation to the personal data held by us. For example, they have the right to obtain a copy of the data, to ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate, and to object to the processing of the data. The
ICO's website
provides more details on the available rights and details of how these rights can be exercised are set out in
Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12
below. Personal data about individuals in their role as owners, directors, and employees of UK businesses may also be obtained, processed and shared by commercial data sharing credit reference agencies not referenced in this Privacy Notice. For further information please refer to the
Business Information Providers Association’s website
.
Please note:
If you are looking for information about the role that data plays in lending decisions made by financial account providers, you may wish to consult Understanding your credit information and how lenders use it. This is published on the website of each of us,
Equifax
,
Experian
and

In this Privacy Notice, these three companies are referred to as Equifax, Experian and TransUnion respectively and collectively referred to as “we” and “us” throughout.
Controllers
Each of us is a controller of the data that we hold. This means that we have certain responsibilities under data protection law to make sure that the data is used fairly and lawfully.
Where we operate as part of a group of companies, we may share joint responsibility with the other members of that group when sharing data with them. You can contact the relevant credit reference agency using the details above if you want to enquire about any of those group companies or exercise any of your rights in respect of your personal data.
2. WHAT DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES USE DATA FOR?
We use data in products and services that we offer to our clients. The purposes for which those products and services are used are described below, but please note that different clients may use the products and services in different ways. Consumers should check the privacy policies of the organisations that they deal with for details about how they use any products and services provided by us.
(a) Credit risk assessment, financial vulnerability, and affordability checks
Each of us use data to provide credit reporting services, financial vulnerability and affordability checks to our clients.
CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT
Organisations use credit reporting services to see how people and businesses are managing payments in respect of their credit commitments and how they have done so in the past. For example, if a person applies for a bank loan to buy a car, the bank may use credit reporting services to check whether that person has kept up with their repayments on any previous credit agreements. It will then use this information, together with information from other sources, to assess the risk of offering the loan, including identifying any financial vulnerabilities.
A financial account provider may also take into account the creditworthiness of a director or business owner as part of its assessment, when considering whether to agree to lend to a business associated with such individuals.
It is important to note that once a search has been undertaken with one of us, it is for the credit provider to decide whether or not to accept that person’s application for credit. While we may help clients to analyse the data or create application models, we are not the decision maker.
AFFORDABILITY AND FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY CHECKS
Organisations use affordability checks made available by us to help understand whether people or businesses are likely to be able to afford to make payments, and to highlight financial vulnerabilities. For example, when you apply for a loan, the lender will check whether you have previously suffered a CCJ or missed credit payments, which might impact your ability to afford the repayment instalments.
Organisations might also check your affordability by reviewing the transaction data or the level of income and expenditure in relation to your payment account. This could include the use of open banking or current account turnover data provided by Current Account providers (“Current Account” refers to bank accounts designed to be used for your day-to-day payment transactions).
The information provided as part of the affordability checks may affect a person’s or business’s ability to obtain credit or other services. For example, where an individual has their own business, a lender may take into consideration the personal credit commitments of that individual, as well as how the business is maintaining its financial commitments, prior to granting credit.
Affordability checks are also used by organisations in the gambling sector to help identify and protect potentially vulnerable people from the impacts of problem gambling by helping organisations set appropriate spending limits and implement appropriate engagement strategies. These checks are used to support gambling organisations comply with their regulatory obligations.
These activities help promote responsible lending, prevent people and businesses from getting into more debt than they can afford, and reduce the amount of unrecoverable debt and insolvencies.
(b) Checks to validate and verify client data, and help prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity
VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
We use data to provide validation and verification services to clients. For example:
Where some products and services are only available to people of a certain age, organisations may check whether the person they are dealing with is eligible by looking at data held by us. For example, if a person is signing up to join a gambling website for people who are at least 18 years old, the organisation may check to see if the age or date of birth provided by the person matches the data held by us.
HELP PREVENT AND DETECT FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
We also use data to help prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity, and apprehend and prosecute offenders.
When a person applies to an organisation for a product or service, the organisation might ask that person to answer questions about themselves, and then check the answers against the data held by us to see if they match. For example, they may ask “What is your current address?” If the address provided does not exist on our records (for example, because it is a fictitious address) or does not match the data held by us (for example, there is no record of the person at the address provided), this may be an indicator of a mistake or fraud.
When a person wants to make a payment to another person, the organisation making that payment might want to understand more about them. By using data about the person making the payment and the intended recipient, the organisation can determine if there are indicators of fraud present. If there are, the organisation may query the payment or take steps to stop it.
Government and quasi-government bodies may use our services to check for potential fraud or other criminal activities, whether people are entitled to certain benefits, and to help recover unpaid taxes, overpaid benefits and similar debts. For example, if a person is claiming single person discount for council tax, a local authority may check with us to see if any other adults are living at the same address. Conversely, public bodies may use our services to identify individuals who may be entitled to discounts but are not claiming them. For further details on government use of our data, refer to
Section 2(m)
.
Law enforcement agencies (including police forces, security services and border control) may also access/ use data held by us to assist with the investigation, prevention or detection of crime and criminal activity.
An indication of invalid or unverified information, fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity may affect (amongst other things) the outcome of an application for a product or service, a tenancy agreement or employment. If clients using the services identify potentially fraudulent activity, they may also pass the applicant’s details to a fraud prevention agency such as Cifas and/or to the police.
For more details about the fraud prevention services offered and the personal data used by each of us please refer to
Section 14
.
(c) Customer management
We use data to provide products and services for organisations to use for customer management purposes. Customer management is the ongoing maintenance of an organisation’s relationship with its customers. This could include activities designed to support:
data accuracy
: for example, to correct or update client customer data held on the organisation’s records, such as correcting spelling mistakes or adding missing fields; or providing services to link records together in order to show a single customer view; and
ongoing relationship and account management activities
: for example, to help organisations make decisions relating to credit limit adjustments, transaction authorisations, card reissue, lending requests, and to identify and manage the accounts of customers including those at risk of financial difficulties, showing signs of financial stress, in arrears, or going through a debt collection process. This may include ongoing monitoring of individuals’ data, and sending alerts to clients in specified circumstances.
(d) Tracing and debt recovery
We use data to provide products and services that allow organisations to trace people. This is typically needed where a person has moved address or changed their telephone number and has not provided their new contact details. We help organisations locate customers they have lost contact with by providing them with updated addresses and other contact details.
The products and services are used to support organisations’ debt recovery and debtor tracing activity. For example, if a person owes money to an organisation and moves to a new house without telling the organisation where they have moved to, the organisation may use these services to help find that person to recover the money that is owed to them.
We also assist debt collectors in predicting, analysing and evaluating the costs of debt recovery to enable them to determine appropriate collections strategies.
These products and services are also used to find people to let them know about assets that they may have forgotten about or not be aware of, such as old dormant savings accounts or pension funds, or to find people to let them know about assets of a deceased person which they have an interest in, such as administrators or beneficiaries of a deceased person’s estate.
Please also see
Section 2(h)
below which describes how we may provide tracing services for marketing purposes.
(e) Tenant vetting
We use data to provide products and services that allow landlords to verify some of the information provided by their prospective tenants, as well as confirming that they are who they say they are and that they are likely to be willing and able to pay their rent on time. Landlords can use this information to help decide whether to agree to the tenancy, or how much of a deposit they should ask for.
(f) Staff and job candidate vetting
We use data to provide products and services that allow organisations to verify some of the information provided by their staff and job candidates and confirm that they are who they say they are. They also enable employers to assess whether the staff member or candidate has a history of managing their own financial commitments well, or whether they are financially compromised. This can be used to help them decide whether the person would be or will continue to be a suitable member of staff.
(g) Insurance risk assessments and pricing
We use data to provide products and services for organisations to use to assess insurance risk. For example, an insurer may find that a person’s financial standing and history can be used to help predict how likely that person is to make a claim on an insurance policy, or how large that claim might be. This can help the insurer to decide (i) whether to provide insurance to a person, (ii) how much the insurance premium should be, and (iii) whether to allow payment for insurance on a credit instalment basis.
(h) Marketing and marketing-related services
OVERVIEW
We offer our clients marketing services. Some of these marketing services use data and some do not, and some impact consumers while others affect directors and/or business owners. For details about the marketing services offered and the personal data used by us for these services, please see the following links:
Experian | Consumer Information Portal
Experian | Marketing Transparency Notice | Business Information UK
Equifax | Privacy Hub | UK
TransUnion | Marketing Services Privacy Notice | UK
As well as other rights, consumers have the right to object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes, including any profiling that is related to direct marketing.
Section 11
sets out more details on how this right can be exercised.
If we provide marketing services, we may use an individual’s title, name (including aliases), address, date of birth, gender and address links information (see
Section 4
for more detail), as well as limited information relating to their financial standing.
SCREENING OUT
We use data to provide screening services to our clients. This means that we identify people who clients may wish to screen out of marketing lists. Screening is used to help ensure that individuals do not receive irrelevant or inappropriate marketing information. These individuals will most often be consumers, but we also provide screening services which impact on company directors and/or business owners for our clients who carry out business-to-business marketing activities.
For example, a client may want to screen out from its marketing list someone who is deceased, or who is under 18, or does not reside at the address they hold, or who may not be interested in a product or service or is unlikely to be accepted for it.
OTHER MARKETING-RELATED ACTIVITIES
In addition, we may use data to offer some or all of the following marketing services:
We may supply the open version of the electoral register (where people have not opted out from their electoral register data being used for marketing and other purposes) to organisations for marketing purposes. This can include identifying new potential customers, verifying that names, addresses and dates of birth collected from other sources are accurate and complete, and informing customers of any errors.
We may identify when someone has moved away from an address so that marketing is not sent to them at that old address.
We may trace individuals to a new address so that their marketing preferences (opt-outs) collected at a previous address can continue to apply at their new address and so that marketing is not sent to them at their old address.
We may help build insight using profiling techniques used by organisations to help them identify people that they want to communicate with about particular products and services. This insight might predict, for example, age, marital status, household composition, length of residency at an address and gender. It can help give organisations insight into the likely characteristics of the UK population at an individual, household and postcode level. Data also helps us to validate the insight being created. This insight might also be used to help clients assess the financial standing of a person so that they can personalise their interactions with them and make communications more relevant and suitable. For example, they could use the insight to select products or offers that they believe would be relevant to that person.
Models and insight created by us can be matched to clients’ own contact lists so that they can make better informed decisions about how they interact with individuals (both consumers and company directors and/or business owners).
We may confirm whether individuals are resident at the address that we or our clients hold for them. This can be done by checking the data to see if there are any open credit accounts at an address and whether the accounts have recent activity, such as where a recent payment has been made. If they do, then it is likely that they have the correct address details. This will help ensure that an individual does not receive marketing for someone else and our clients do not send marketing to the wrong address.
We may also use data to help keep our own marketing suppression lists (or those of our group companies) accurate and up to date. For example, if you have previously asked to be excluded from marketing activity and your data indicates that you have since moved or changed your name, that information can be used to make sure that you continue to be excluded from marketing activity at your new address or under your new name.
(i) Profiling, statistical analysis and anonymisation
We use, and allow our clients to use, data to carry out profiling of consumers through statistical analysis. This includes the creation, validation and use of scorecards, models, and attributes in connection with the assessment of risks relating to credit, fraud, affordability, financial vulnerability and debt collection. It is also used in verifying identities, to monitor and predict market trends and to enable clients to refine lending and fraud strategies, and loss forecasting. This can include drawing inferences about individuals on the basis of the data available, such as inferences about whether a credit application they have made has been accepted or declined.
These practices profile consumers (typically a client’s own customers or previous applicants) to help determine the likelihood that a consumer with certain characteristics will act in a way that will produce certain outcomes; for example, to repay credit, to be able to afford credit, to claim on an insurance policy, to commit fraud, to respond to certain collection strategies or to become insolvent.
We may also convert personal data into statistical or aggregated form so that individuals are not identified or identifiable (thereby creating anonymised data). Anonymised data is not personal data, and we may use such data to conduct research and analysis, including to produce statistical research and reports or for any other purposes.
We may share this anonymised data with organisations, such as those identified in
Section 5
. For example, this non personal data may be shared with government and public sector organisations to help them: assess the impact of changes to the financial economy on consumers and businesses; to inform policy setting and monitor the effectiveness of policy implementation; or to enable tailored economic support and other key resources to be directed to the groups that need it the most.
(j) Data management activities
We use data to carry out certain processing activities to support our own business operations. This includes supporting the effectiveness, efficiency and security of our databases, products and services, both in the context of our credit reference activities and more widely. For example:
Data loading: data is checked for integrity, validity, consistency, quality and age to help make sure it is accurate. These checks pick up issues such as irregular dates of birth, names, addresses, account start and default dates, and gaps in status history.
Data matching: data is matched to our existing databases to help make sure it is assigned to the right person, even when there are discrepancies like spelling mistakes or previous names or different versions of a person’s name. We use data to create and confirm identities, which we use to underpin the services that we provide.
Data linking: when we compile data into our databases, we create links between different pieces of information. For example, people who appear financially associated with each other may be linked together and a person can be linked with their previous and current addresses. Also, where someone has an alias, such as a maiden name and married name, these names will be linked.
System maintenance and testing: data may be used when carrying out system maintenance, repair and testing, and security activity.
Each of us have our own processes and standards for data management activity.
(k) New development and testing
We use data to help develop new products, services and technologies and to test them. This may include the controlled use of artificial intelligence or machine learning techniques. We may combine data with information from other parts of our businesses and use data to develop products, services and technologies in other parts of our businesses. Where appropriate, we will anonymise data before it is used for these purposes.
(l) Compliance with laws
We use and disclose data where required by law. For example, this can happen in response to a court order or a request from a regulator, or in order to comply with a request from a person (or by a third party acting on their behalf), to exercise their legal rights in respect of any personal data, such as by requesting a copy of it.
(m) Government and public sector organisations
We may provide data to government and public sector organisations. For example, their uses of this data could include:
the assessment or collection of any taxes, duties, or other such impositions; recovering unpaid income tax, council tax or national insurance contributions;
recovering unpaid television licence fees;
benefits eligibility assessment and monitoring (for example, by checking for changes in circumstances that would affect established eligibility);
the assessment or collection of any payments due to a public sector organisation in carrying out a statute or other legal obligation;
the detection and prevention of a crime, and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders;
the detection, prevention and recovery of improper payments or overpayments from public funds; and
for the purposes of any legal proceedings (including prospective legal proceedings).
3. WHAT ARE THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES’ LEGAL GROUNDS FOR HANDLING CREDIT REFERENCE DATA?
Data protection law requires us to always have what is referred to as a “lawful basis” (i.e. a reason or justification) for processing personal data. There are a number of lawful bases available, but the majority of our data processing activity is on the basis that:
the processing is necessary to pursue our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties (such as our clients), and those interests do not unduly prejudice the rights and freedoms of individuals; or
the processing is necessary to comply with a
legal obligation
binding on us.
For information about any other lawful basis relied on by each of us, please review our individual privacy notices (see
Section 14
).
LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
We use data to pursue our legitimate interests, those of our clients and those of individuals. The following table explains these legitimate interests. We have carried out assessments and concluded that these interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
Interest
Explanation
Promoting responsible lending and helping to prevent over-indebtedness
Responsible lending means that lenders only sell products that are affordable and suitable for the borrowers’ circumstances. This is in the interests of borrowers so that they do not become burdened with debt that they cannot afford to repay, and the stress associated with that. It is also in the interests of lenders in that it reduces bad debt and collections activity.
We facilitate responsible lending by providing services that allow lenders to access information about a person (and anyone they have a financial association with, such as a joint account holder), including how they are managing current debt, have managed debt in the past and whether they have sufficient income to repay the debt.
Helping prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and validate and verify identity
We provide identity, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering services to help clients meet legal and regulatory obligations. These services benefit individuals by facilitating prompt access to services through identity verification, and helping to protect them against fraud, and other criminal activity.
Prevention and detection of fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity is in our legitimate interest and that of our clients. It is also to the benefit of wider society and therefore in the public interest.
Customer and data management activities for the benefit of consumers and businesses.
We provide services which help businesses maintain the quality of their own customer data they hold and to make informed decisions about how they engage with their customers.
It is in our legitimate interests to offer these services to our clients, but it is also in the legitimate interests of both the consumer and businesses by helping ensure that the information held about them is accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date and that informed and responsible decisions can be made, particularly in the context of lending decisions.
Supporting tracing and debt recovery
We provide services that support tracing and collections where the client has a legitimate interest in conducting activity to find its customers and to recover debt, or to reunite, or confirm that an asset relates to the right person.
Enabling landlords to check the suitability of their prospective tenants
We enable landlords to verify some of the information provided by their prospective tenants, as well as confirming that they are who they say they are and that they are likely to be willing and able to pay their rent on time. This helps the landlord to decide whether to agree to the tenancy, or how much of a deposit they should ask for; and it reduces the risk that the tenancy relationship will subsequently break down. It also helps tenants to avoid getting into legal difficulties where they have agreed to pay rent that they cannot afford.
Enabling employers to check the suitability of their current and prospective staff
We enable employers to verify some of the information provided by their staff and job candidates and confirm that they are who they say they are. They also enable employers to assess whether the staff member or candidate has a history of managing their own financial commitments well, or whether they are financially compromised. This can help reduce the risk of fraud and can help the employer to decide whether the person is or would be a suitable member of its staff. All of which is in the legitimate interest of those employers.
Enabling insurers to calculate and price risk more accurately
We enable insurers to consider certain kinds of data when they are assessing risk. This data can help the insurer decide whether to provide cover to a person, and how much the insurance premium should be. This enables them to better forecast their future liability and to price their insurance products more accurately and competitively. For consumers, it means that insurance policies are priced more fairly, with the lowest-risk individuals paying less for their insurance.
Supporting government and public sector organisations in the performance of their duties
We enable government and public sector organisations to consider certain kinds of data to help them in the performance of their duties. For example, this could include the assessment or collection of taxes; benefits eligibility assessment and monitoring; and the detection, prevention and recovery of improper payments or overpayments from public funds. This enables them to protect public money and ensure it is used effectively. This is in the public interest. For consumers, it means that their tax contributions are utilised efficiently and effectively and that the right benefits and entitlements are granted to them.
Supporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
Our services may be used by our clients to help them comply with their own regulatory obligations, for example, complying with anti-money laundering obligations and regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) which require lenders to assess the creditworthiness of individuals who apply for loans. This is in the legitimate interest of clients.
Our services are also regulated and may use data to ensure our own legal and regulatory compliance. As part of this compliance, regulators may also ask us to provide information to assist them. For example, the FCA may ask for data to help inform them of areas of potential harm to allow them to identify areas where they should focus their resources.
Further, these regulatory obligations are in place in the interests of wider society, so facilitating compliance with them indirectly benefits society as a whole, which is in the public interest.
Promoting responsible, efficient and informed marketing activities for the benefit of consumers and businesses
We provide services to support organisations in ensuring that their marketing strategies are responsible, informed and efficient. This helps them to reduce waste (driving costs down and increasing competition) and avoid sending communications to individuals who are less likely to be interested in receiving them or who should not receive them.
Commercial interests
It is in each of our legitimate interests to provide the services described above to our clients to generate sales revenues.
Enabling gambling organisations to meet their obligations to protect individuals from the impacts of problem gambling
Our services may be used by organisations to help protect individuals from the impacts associated with problem gambling and gambling related harms. Excessive spending on gambling at the expense of payment of priority household debts (such as mortgage or rent payments) could have a significant financial impact on the individual and family unit.  This is in the legitimate interests of gambling organisations and supports them to comply with their regulatory obligations, whilst also being in the legitimate interests of individuals.
There are wider societal benefits, including reducing the burden on public health services and impacts on the economy.
Our use of data is subject to an extensive framework of safeguards that balance the legitimate interests set out above with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people whose data we use and share. The framework includes information given to people about how their data will be used and how they can exercise their rights to obtain their personal data, have it corrected, erased, or restricted, object to it being processed, and complain if they are dissatisfied. It also includes extensive due diligence checks on clients, robust contractual arrangements, and internal data management processes that we have in place. These safeguards help sustain a fair and appropriate balance and to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals.
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS
In some circumstances we are required by law to use or share data in particular ways. This happens, for example, when a court, law enforcement agency or regulator makes a legally binding request or order for disclosure of data. It also happens when individual consumers exercise their rights, for example by requesting a copy of their own personal data from us.
4. WHAT KINDS OF DATA DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES USE, AND WHERE DO THEY GET IT FROM?
Each of us obtains and uses data (including your personal data) from different sources, so we often hold information that is different to some degree from that held by the others.
However, most of the personal data we each hold falls into the categories outlined below from the sources described (please note that some of this data may relate to individuals from the Crown Dependencies as well as from the UK).
Information type
Description
Source
Identifiers
We hold personal data that can be used to identify people, such as name, date of birth, and current and previous addresses. We may also hold business data including name, address and details of company shareholders and directors.
We may also hold business data including name, address and details of company shareholders and directors.
This data is part of some of the other data sources mentioned below in this table.
Data about postal addresses is obtained from commercial sources such as Royal Mail.
Data about businesses may also be sourced from public websites, including Companies House and companies’ own websites.
Electoral register data
We hold information from the electoral register (also known as the ‘Electoral Roll’). There are two versions of this. One is known as the open register (also known as the ‘Edited Electoral Roll’ or ‘EER’) and can be used for a variety of purposes including marketing. The other is the full register which we can only use for limited purposes.
This data is supplied by local authorities.
Credit account performance data
We receive personal data about how people are managing to repay their credit commitments.
The data includes the name of the lending organisation, the date the account was opened, the account number, the amount of debt outstanding (if any), any credit available (including overdraft limits) and the repayment history on the account, including late and missing payments. This may also include transactions that have been made on a buy now pay later basis.
This data is provided from banks, building societies and other financial services providers such as credit card companies, credit suppliers, credit unions, hire purchase companies and buy now pay later organisations. It is also provided by utilities companies, mobile phone networks, retail and mail order companies and insurance companies.
Rental related data
Some of us receive personal data about whether people are managing to pay their rent on time.
The data includes tenancy reference, start date, end date, rental amount, arrangement amount and outstanding balance.
This data is provided by social housing providers and private landlords. You can also sign up to certain services which identify your rent payments from your bank account transactions and report them to us.
Current Account turnover data
This data includes the name of the organisation providing Current Accounts, current account numbers, sort codes, the number of account holders, the current balance, a figure for credits on each current account and sometimes a figure for debits.
This data is provided from organisations who offer people Current Accounts, such as banks and building societies and e-money institutions.
Application salary data
This data consists of the salary declared by a person when they are applying for credit. It also includes whether that figure is net or gross, and whether the salary has been verified (e.g. with copies of salary slips). This data also includes the date that an application was made.
This data is provided to us by organisations who collect declared income from individuals when they apply for credit.
This information is provided as a separate file of data, although declared income can sometimes be provided together with other data (see search footprints below).
Open Banking data
This data includes details of the financial transactions within your payment account(s) accessed via Open Banking (including details of payment amounts, dates, payees and payers).
This data is made available by your account provider, where access to the account has been specifically authorised by you.
For example, this may be to help support a credit application you are making to a lender or as proof of your income.
We are only permitted to obtain this data through being FCA registered Account Information Service Providers or though working with firms that hold this FCA permission.
For more details of how each credit reference agency provides open banking services, please see the privacy notices of each credit reference agency, a link to which is provided in
Section 14
.
Judgment data
We obtain data about court judgments and decrees. This may include, for example, the name of the court, the nature of the judgment, how much money was owed, and whether the judgment has been satisfied.
The government makes court judgments and other decrees and administrative orders publicly available through statutory public registers. These are maintained by Registry Trust Limited, which supplies the data on the registers to us.
Insolvency data
We obtain data about insolvency-related events. This includes data about bankruptcies, administration orders, individual voluntary arrangements, debt relief orders, sequestrations, trust deeds and debt arrangement schemes. This data includes the start and end dates of the relevant insolvency or arrangement.
This data is obtained from The Insolvency Service, the Accountant in Bankruptcy, The Stationary Office and Northern Ireland’s Department for the Economy – Insolvency Service, the London, Belfast and Edinburgh Gazettes and Registry Trust Limited.
Business insolvency data is obtained from the London, Belfast and Edinburgh Gazettes.
Fraud prevention indicators
This data consists of information which indicates that an individual has demonstrated behaviour that appears to be consistent with that of known fraudulent conduct. It also consists of information where an individual has been a victim of identity fraud or feels that his or her personal data is vulnerable due to a data breach.
This data is generated internally by us and also obtained from third parties such as Cifas, a not-for-profit fraud prevention membership organisation.
Search footprints
When an organisation uses us to make enquiries about a person, we keep a record of that enquiry. This is known as a ‘search footprint’. This includes the name of the organisation, the date, and the purpose for which the enquiry was made.
We may also receive additional data that was provided as part of the search, such as employment status, disclosed income (income sometimes provided separately as application salary data) and contact information.
Some footprints are visible only to us and the individual about whom they are made. Other searches are also visible to other organisations, and in some cases can therefore affect credit decisions (e.g. where an organisation draws a negative inference from a debt collection search).
We generate search footprints automatically when enquiries are made about a person.
Each credit reference agency only creates search footprints for searches against its own records.
Scores
We and our clients use data to produce scores including in relation to credit, affordability, fraud, identity, collections and insolvency.
We use algorithms known as ‘scorecards’ to produce scores. Similarly, other organisations create their own scores from data obtained from us as well as other sources.
Other third-party data
This data includes phone numbers and email addresses, data concerning politically exposed persons (PEPs) and people on sanctions lists as well as mortality data.
We receive this data from reputable commercial sources under contracts agreed from time to time.
Other additional information credit reference agencies create (not already referred to in this table)
We derive certain additional information from the data. For example:
Summarised and aggregated data
: we can summarise data, for example by providing a count of the total number of accounts or judgments a person has, or the total amount of debt. We can also aggregate data about different consumers together, for example to provide an overview of the financial status of particular postcodes and other geographical areas. This may then be anonymised data.
Address links
: when we detect that a person has moved to a new house, we may create and store a link between the old and new address.
Aliases
: when we believe that a person has changed their name, we may record the old name alongside the new one.
Financial associations and linked people
: when we believe that two or more people are financially linked with each other (for example, because they have a joint account, apply for credit together, such as a mortgage or loan, or get a joint County Court Judgment), we may record that fact. Just sharing an address with someone or even being married to them (but not having any joint credit) does not make them a financial associate.
Your financial associates can impact your ability to get credit. They appear on your credit report, and companies may check their credit history when deciding whether to approve you. This is because your financial associates may affect your ability to repay debt. For example, if your partner has been made bankrupt, companies may be concerned that you will need to help them repay their debts before you can repay your own. Credit scores you receive through services you sign-up for may reflect and explain the impact of a financial associate on your ability to get credit.
Flags and triggers
: we may create flags and triggers that we use in our systems to highlight that certain data exists or to summarise that data. For example, if we hold fraud data from the fraud organisation known as Cifas, we may create a flag indicating this fact. This flag would highlight to clients that the data is available and give them the opportunity to ask for more details.
We generate this additional information from the data sources already available to us.
Data provided by individuals themselves
People sometimes provide data about themselves directly to us. For example, individuals have the right to ask us to add a short statement that will be displayed when an organisation sees data about them. This statement is known as a ‘notice of correction’ and can be used to allow the person to explain the reason for an entry. The right to do this is explained in
Section 10
below).
If a person exercises any of their other legal rights, we will retain data relating to these activities, for example, records will be kept of all actions and correspondence relating to managing complaints.
This data is provided directly by individuals themselves.
5. WHO DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES SHARE DATA WITH?
This section describes the types of organisations we share data with. Before sharing data with any third party we will, where appropriate, complete our own due diligence checks to ensure that the organisation is a real business and has applicable regulatory authorisations in place.
Clients
We supply our products and services to clients in various sectors, such as banks, building societies, other credit providers, buy now-pay later providers, utility companies, mobile phone companies, insurance companies, employers, credit report providers, retailers, gambling organisations, tenant and employee vetting firms, professional services organisations (such as firms of solicitors and accountants), estate agents, landlords, marketing companies, charities and public bodies such as the police, central and local government and regulators.
Certain organisations that share financial data with us are members of closed user groups which entitle them to receive similar kinds of financial data contributed by other organisations in the group. These organisations are typically banks, building societies, and other lenders, as well as other credit providers like utilities companies, mobile phone networks and other organisations like gambling firms.
Resellers, distributors, partners, agents and other third parties
We sometimes use or partner up with other third party organisations to provide combined products or products which combine our data with other information to help provide our products and services to clients and to help us improve our own products and services. To do this, we may provide data to third parties so that they can provide the services.
Service providers
We may use other external organisations and other members of our own groups of companies to perform tasks on their behalf (for example, IT service providers, call centre providers and security service providers). To do this, we may provide or make available data to them so that they can perform the tasks.
Fraud prevention agencies
Each of us is a member of Cifas, a not-for-profit fraud prevention service. Where we believe that you may have been a victim of fraud, we may share that information with Cifas so that other Cifas members can access it. This enables other Cifas members to check when (for example) a credit application is made in your name. Please refer to the
Cifas’ privacy notice
for more details.
Government and other public sector organisations
We may share information with government and other public sector organisations, including the following bodies: ministerial government departments, such as the Department of Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs, HM Treasury, the Cabinet Office; publicly owned corporations and other arm’s length bodies such as the Public Sector Fraud Authority) and private sector organisations providing services on behalf of a public sector organisations, such as a housing association acting on behalf of a local authority.
Regulators
Regulators, such as the Financial Conduct Authority, Competition & Markets Authority, Information Commissioner’s Office, Ofgem and Ofwat, can sometimes request or require us to supply them with personal data. This can be for a range of purposes such as investigating complaints or in response to legal obligations. The regulators may also need data insights from us when assessing how well a particular industry sector is working.
Law enforcement agencies
This includes police forces, security services and border control.
Individuals
People are entitled to obtain copies of the personal data we hold about them. Details on how to do this are set out in
Section 9
below.
6. WHERE IS DATA STORED AND SENT?
All three of us are based in the UK and keep our main databases there. We may also have operations and service providers elsewhere inside and outside the UK and the European Economic Area, and data may be accessed from those locations too. Regardless of where the data is processed, we ensure that it is always protected by applicable UK and European data protection standards.
While the UK and countries in the European Economic Area all ensure a high standard of data protection law, some parts of the world may not provide the same level of legal protection when it comes to personal data. As a result, when we send data overseas we make sure suitable safeguards are in place in accordance with applicable UK and European data protection requirements, to protect the data. For example, these safeguards might include:
Sending the data to a country that has been approved by the relevant authorities as having a suitably high standard of data protection law. Examples include the Isle of Man, Switzerland and Canada.
Putting in place a contract with the receiving organisation containing terms approved by the relevant authorities as providing a suitable level of protection.
Sending the data to an organisation which is a member of a scheme that has been approved by the relevant authorities as providing a suitable level of protection. One example is the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (UK-US “Data Bridge”) agreed between the UK and US authorities.
Overseas recipients of data include our group companies, clients, resellers and service providers. Please see
Section 5
for more information about recipients of data.
More information about the safeguards we each use can be obtained by contacting us at the contact details in
Section 1
above.
7. FOR HOW LONG IS DATA RETAINED?
Each of us may retain data for different periods of time. Information about our respective retention periods can be found at the following locations:
Equifax:
Equifax I CRAIN - Data Retention Periods
Experian:
Experian | CRAIN Data Retention Periods
TransUnion:
TransUnion | CRAIN Data Retention Periods
These periods are subject to regular review and may change from time to time.
8. DO THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS OR PROFILE THEM?
DECISIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS
We do not tell organisations what decisions to make about consumers. Our role is primarily to provide information to other organisations which supports them in making their own decisions as this is for each organisation to decide. For example, we do not tell lenders whether to offer credit to consumers; we just provide services that help those lenders make decisions about consumers. An organisation’s own data, knowledge, processes and practices will also play a significant role in those decisions.
We may provide similar services to our respective clients, but these services may lead to different decisions because (i) each credit reference agency may hold different information from the others, (ii) each client may place differing importance on some information compared to others, and (iii) each client may take into account information available to it from other sources. These are some of the reasons why a person may receive a “yes” from one lender but a “no” from another.
SCORES AND RATINGS
When requested, we use the data we obtain to produce credit, risk, fraud, identity, affordability, screening, collection and insolvency scores and ratings; these are explained in
Section 4
above. In providing these scores and ratings to our clients, we are not making decisions about consumers or telling organisations what decisions to make about consumers – this is for each organisation to decide on the basis of their own criteria.
9. HOW CAN A CONSUMER SEE WHAT DATA THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES HOLD ABOUT THEM? DO CONSUMERS HAVE A ‘DATA PORTABILITY’ RIGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR DATA?
Data access right
Consumers have the right to find out what personal data we hold about them. Each of us provides more information about access rights on our websites.

DATA PORTABILITY RIGHT
Data protection legislation also contains a right to data portability. Where it applies, the right to data portability gives consumers a right to receive their personal data in a standard format. However, this right only applies when personal data is processed on certain lawful grounds, such as consent. This right does not apply to our data because it is processed on the grounds of “legitimate interests”. To find out more about legitimate interests please go to
Section 3
above.
10. WHAT CAN A CONSUMER DO IF THEIR CREDIT REFERENCE DATA IS WRONG?
When the credit reference agencies receive personal data, they perform lots of checks on it to try and detect any defects or mistakes. Ultimately, though, the credit reference agencies rely on their suppliers to provide accurate data.
If a consumer thinks that any personal data a credit reference agency holds about them is wrong or incomplete, the consumer has the right to challenge it. If challenged, the credit reference agency will need to take reasonable steps to check the data, such as asking the organisation that supplied it to check and confirm its accuracy.
If the data turns out to be wrong, the credit reference agency will update its records accordingly. If the credit reference agency still believes that the data is correct after completing their checks, they will continue to hold and use it. Where the data is part of the consumer’s credit report, they can ask the credit reference agency to add a supplementary statement of up to 200 words explaining their views about the information. This statement will be supplied to organisations who subsequently access the information that the consumer has disputed.
To do this, consumers should contact the relevant credit reference agency using the contact details in
Section 1
above. Where more than one credit reference agency holds incorrect information, it may be necessary to contact them separately.
11. CAN A CONSUMER OBJECT TO THE USE OF THEIR CREDIT REFERENCE DATA AND HAVE IT DELETED?
This section helps consumers understand how to exercise their data protection rights to object to data being used by us and how to ask for it to be deleted. To understand these rights and how they apply to the processing of data, it is important to know that we hold and process personal data under the “legitimate interests” basis for processing (see
Section 3
above for more information about this), and do not rely on consent.
Consumers have the right to object to the processing of personal data by us. This can be done by contacting the relevant credit reference agency using the contact details in
Section 1
above.
Although consumers have complete freedom to contact us with objections at any time, under data protection law, a consumer’s right to object does not automatically lead to a requirement for processing to stop, or for personal data to be deleted.
Because of the importance of the credit referencing industry to the UK’s financial system, and the important purposes for which the data is needed (such as supporting responsible lending, and preventing over-indebtedness, fraud and money laundering) we will normally have compelling, overriding grounds to carry on using the personal data following an objection. In many cases, it will not be appropriate for us to restrict or to stop processing or delete data, for example, where the result would be to hide a poor credit history that could enable a person or organisation to get credit they otherwise would not be eligible for.
However, as an exception from the general rule described above, all consumers have an absolute right to object to their personal data being used for direct marketing purposes. If you object to us using your personal data for those purposes, you can get us to stop by contacting us using the details in
Section 1
or specifically, in the case of Experian, through the online service at
https://www.experianmarketingservices.digital/OptOut
.
12. CAN A CONSUMER RESTRICT WHAT THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES DO WITH THEIR DATA?
In some circumstances, consumers can ask us to restrict how we use their data. Contact details for each credit reference agency are in
Section 1
above.
This is not an absolute right and processing will only be restricted if certain conditions are met (for example, if the processing is unlawful or the personal data is no longer required by us for the purposes for which it was obtained).
Even where a restriction condition is met, a consumer’s personal data may still be processed (and shared) by us where certain grounds exist. These are:
with the consumer’s consent
for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims
for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person
for reasons of important public interest
We will consider and respond to requests we receive and will assess whether any of the restriction conditions apply and, if they do, whether there are any grounds that permit the continued processing of the personal data.
Given the importance of complete and accurate data, for purposes including, for example, for responsible lending and preventing over-indebtedness, fraud and money laundering, it will usually be appropriate for us to continue processing data on the basis of protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. Consumers can contact us to ask about this processing of their personal data so that they can understand how their data will be used.
13. WHO CAN A CONSUMER COMPLAIN TO IF THEY ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE USE OF THEIR DATA?
THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCY
Each credit reference agency tries to ensure that it delivers the best outcomes for its clients and for consumers. If a consumer wants to make a complaint to us, they can do so by contacting us at the following addresses.

1. Introduction
We are Synectics Solutions Ltd., a fraud prevention agency which works with organisations in the fight against fraud and financial crime. Those organisations (our clients) include businesses from the finance sector, insurance sector and others who have a legitimate interest to prevent fraud against them and to verify the authenticity of an identity.
1.1. National SIRA Fraud Prevention Service
Before our clients provide services, goods or financing to you, they may undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. These checks require them and us to process personal data about you.

name
date of birth
residential address and address history

When we process your personal data, we do so on the basis that our clients have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect their business and to comply with laws that apply to them. Such processing may also be a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.
We may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
In order to process your application our clients may supply some of your personal information to a credit reference agency (e.g. TransUnion International UK Limited, Equifax Limited), which is providing services such as credit risk and affordability checking, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, identity verification and tracing.
The credit reference agency will use your personal information to provide services to our clients. They may use their services in order to assess your creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity such as fraud and money laundering.
More information about the ways in which credit reference agencies use and share personal information can be found in their respective privacy notices (e.g.

you appear to have deliberately hidden your true
You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more please contact us using the details below.
1.1.4. Consequences of Processing

A record of any fraud or money laundering risk may be passed to us and other fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details above.
1.1.5. Processing of special categories of personal data and criminal offence etc data
Our clients may include processing of special categories of personal data and criminal convictions etc data.

2.  What Does This Notice Cover?
This Privacy Information explains how we use your personal data: how it is collected, how it is held, and how it is processed. It also explains your rights under the law relating to your personal data.
3. What Is Personal Data?
Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “the Data Protection Legislation”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.
Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.
The personal data that we use is set out in Part 5, below.
4. What Are My Rights?
Under the Data Protection Legislation, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:
The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Notice should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 12.
The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 10 will tell you how to do this.
The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 12 to find out more.
The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we hold. Please contact us using the details in Part 12 to find out more.
The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.
The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.
The right to withdraw consent. This means that, if we are relying on your consent as the legal basis for using your personal data, you are free to withdraw that consent at any time.
The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.
For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 12.
It is important that your personal data is kept accurate and up-to-date. If any of the personal data we hold about you changes, please keep us informed as long as we have that data.
Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.
If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office. We would welcome the opportunity to resolve your concerns ourselves, however, so please contact us first, using the details in Part 12.

We share your data with external third parties, as detailed below in Part 9, that are based outside of the EEA. The following safeguards are applied to such transfers:

These contracts require the same levels of personal data protection that would apply under the Data Protection Legislation. More information is available from the
European Commission
.
Where we transfer your data to a third party based outside the UK, including in the United States, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and applicable data protection laws. These safeguards may include:
The use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), supplemented by the UK Addendum where necessary, to ensure the data is subject to protections equivalent to those provided under UK law; or
The use of the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA), where appropriate.
We assess each transfer on a case-by-case basis and implement additional measures as required to ensure the security and protection of your personal data.
The security of your personal data is essential to us, and to protect your data, we take a number of important measures, including the following:
limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality; and
procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner’s Office where we are legally required to do so.

If any of your personal data is shared with a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 8.
If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation, as explained above in Part 8.
10. How Can I Access My Personal Data?
If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.
All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 12.
There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.
We will respond to your subject access request within 30 days and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time.
