help center.
How does the free trial work?
At New Faith Network we give our new users the first days free access to all our movies. All we need is to verify your information through a one-time payment of $0,04.
During the registration process we do ask you to already make a choice between either our monthly or yearly membership. The reason why we ask this, is so that when you’re happy with New Faith Network you don’t have to take any other actions to keep watching: after your free trial period of days you’re automatically registered with your chosen membership.
However, when you cancel your membership within the trial, you won’t pay anything.
