Why?
Org mode
on
Emacs
is wonderful. I'm a big fan and use it regularly on my laptop. As an iPhone user, I wanted
quick access to org tasks while on the go
... so
I built
Plain Org
for iOS.

Feature requests
Org has a
rich feature set
. Plain Org is young and catching up. It's only me behind it, so I have to prioritize whatever is built next. If Plain Org v1 is missing a feature, file a request over at
r/plainorg
or upvote an existing one. You can also send feedback via Plain Org itself.
What is org?
Org
is a powerful plain text markup, somewhat similar to markdown. It's got
lots of features
. Being pure text, you can view and edit using your favourite text editor (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) while you're at your computer.
Here's a sample snippet:
#+TITLE: My iPhone stuff
* Inbox
** DONE [#A] Publish Plain Org to App Store                        :plainorg:

Syncing your data
Plain Org syncs data using iOS
file-providing extensions
. If your favorite cloud service offers an iOS extension, Plain Org should be able to open, edit, and sync your data.
Your mileage may vary creating new files or opening local links. These may not be possible using your provider's extension.

Paid app
Plain Org is a paid app. At present, it is not
FOSS
. This may change in the future, but it is not something I can currently offer. I understand this may not be ideal for all, but hope there's partial relief in implementing a well-known text markup (ie. no vendor lock-in). Please help support its development if you can. Ping me if you need a free copy. Email me at "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com".

      https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html
Beta testing
Please help support Plain Org by purchasing from the App Store. If you're feeling adventurous and have tolerance for a few rough edges, you can also get access to early beta builds via TestFlight. I'll need an email address to send you an invite. Ping me on
reddit
,
twitter
, or email me at "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com".
FAQ
Can I use my own custom keywords?
Yes. Plain Org recognizes
per-file keywords
. That is, in the org file itself, you can specify both active and inactive keywords. You can the following to an existing org file:
#+TODO: TODO STARTED BLOCKED | DONE CANCELLED
Note:
Keywords on the left hand side of the "|" are considered active while those on the right are inactive.
How do I sync my org files?
All depends on your preferred provider. See
syncing your data
.
What kind of links are supported?
http(s):// links
https://plainorg.com
http://plainorg.com
[[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]]
id: links (across files)
To resolve id links, Plain Org needs granted access to a directory. When an id link is opened, the app searches the owning directory for other org files that may contain the id that's linked to. The following snippet shows a sample snippet:
Note:
Not all syncing providers support granting access to a directory. Without this, Plain Org is unable to resolve id links.
Documents/bar.org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       90daa47c-3d6b-4d94-bf78-18d776c431c1
:CREATED:  [2021-09-28 Tue 09:02]
:END:
#+TITLE: Bar
* TODO Review [[id:e4453d79-227f-4a78-bf04-9bdff5e4675f][Foo]]
Documents/foo.org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e4453d79-227f-4a78-bf04-9bdff5e4675f
:CREATED:  [2021-09-28 Tue 09:02]
:END:
#+TITLE: Foo
* Some heading
* Another heading
file: links
To resolve file links, Plain Org needs granted access to a directory. When an file link is opened, the app tries to access the referenced file within the owning directory. If the linked file is an image and is accessible, Plain Org renders it inline. For others, like pdfs, they are opened in a modal screen.
Note:
Not all syncing providers support granting access to a directory. Without this, Plain Org is unable to resolve file links.
File structure
Documents/report.org
Documents/subdir/image.png
Documents/subdir/foo.org
Documents/subdir/document.pdf
Documents/report.org
[[file:subdir/foo.org][Foo]]
[[file:subdir/image.png]]
[[file:subdir/document.pdf]]
Note:
Relative link resolution requires the org file's owning directory (i.e. Documents) to be a parent of the linked file.
Unsupported
[[file:../Desktop/foo.org][Foo]]

An essential and beautiful app for org mode on the go
This app has been a game-changer for me. I use it to write and edit todo lists, notes and journal when I’m away from my computer and the app seamlessly syncs these with files and backups through the cloud (I use iCloud). It is also fantastic for inserting links to items (like webpages, snippets of code) on my iPhone.

I use emacs org mode for almost everything I do: keeping todo lists, plans, notes from meetings or research ideas, drafting papers, preparing presentations. (I transitioned to org mode after trying many other “productivity” programs, because none of them gave me the interface I needed between all of these functions.)

Until Plainorg came along, I used org mode and accessed my org files only when I was sitting in front of a computer. None of the other mobile options gave me an easy sync with the cloud. (Maybe I’m just not tech-savvy enough!) I think I was also turned off by the other app’s clunky interfaces on an iPhone. This meant I carried around paper notebooks to jot down items, or ideas, as they occurred to me when away from a laptop or desktop. But, this was not ideal – I missed nuances: todo actions that would pop up when I’m writing notes, or detailed URLs (when I was too lazy to collect them under some easy-to-find-again bookmark).

Plainorg is the first app I have found which works on an iPhone and it works brilliantly! I've reached out to the developer on a few small issues and he was very quick to respond. I recommend it very highly to anyone who is using org mode.

The beautiful interface is incentive enough to start using org mode I think, if you’re not using it already.

A pretty good org-mode App!
Compare to another org-mode Apps for iOS-device, it supports many unique features like displaying inline images or rendering table perfectly even with full-width characters(like Chinese characters).
And the most important: the author is very responsive so once you have any idea or advice, just talk to him!

Great Org App
Thank you for providing a plain text organizer. The author is very responsive and improves the app continually.

 It provides a very good raw edit feature. Great for tasks.
You can check the developer website for details.

Agenda feature is missing so far, but the developer is constantly adding features. We are all invited to ask. :) That is wonderful.

A different take on org tables editing!
Plain org is an org files editor, allowing to edit org tables, view images and so on. Also, the UX is quite good. I hope that one day the agenda functionality will also be added, but it is also useful as it is now.

A fine editor
It does Org mode editing really well on a single file. However relying on the Files app to handle browsing and searching is a really poor experience. It finds nothing, even files by name. With a large collection this app doesn’t really work (at least with working copy).

Bugs + uncomfortable ui
1. Dropbox files opening doesn't work sometimes
2. Adding subitem isn't working
3. Reordering expands all suites so it's very difficult to move items to the end of the file
4. No syntax highlight in text edit mode

The pleasure of Org on iOS
I've gone through each and every org-mode supporting (and "supporting") app that works on iPhone. Native, PWA, you name it. They all fell short with either being too focused on tasks or too clunky to work with. PlainOrg is a pleasure to work with. Not overpacked w features, not lacking anything of substance. Love it. Thanks a bunch for all the efforts u/xenodium!

Nice but needs work
- Editing on iPad Pro doesn’t work
- Can't copy and paste text from
other sources.
- Needs a tutorial
- Inconsistent interface. (Edit and Add
functions need to indicate WHAT
they're editing or adding)
- Good start, but not intuitive for an
org mode novice

Better than Beorg
For my purposes, this is much better than the competitors in the “org-mode” editor space.  I use NextCloud to store my files, and since the NextCloud app on iPad/iPhone interfaces with the native Files app, I can access all my org files from NextCloud in this app!! So happy to have found this!

A breath of fresh air
Plain Org is the first time I’ve been genuinely excited about any iOS software in a while. The commitment to an iOS-native feel is greatly appreciated, and the developer has been pretty successful in sticking to it despite the complexity inherent to Org. Keeping to best practices also makes for a strong focus on reading and writing Org rather than having to manage externalities such as file backend implementations. It keeps the app small and free of unnecessary feature duplication. Combined with Working Copy, it’s an unmatched task management experience on iOS, and iCloud works too if you’re not much of a Git guru.

The developer is very active on the app’s community page and is frequently testing new features. He’s also responded to every one of my emails. It won’t be long before I uninstall Beorg, I think 🤫.

Worth every penny, highly recommend.

Tiny request: it’s time for a proper settings screen. The context menu trees are getting a bit disorienting :)

I lost work to this
If you type something in and close the keyboard your text disappears. I lost work I spent time on because of this. The app would be nice if it didn't do that but that makes it less than useless for me.

Please get in touch ASAP "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com" or use the feedback menu in the app. This sounds like a bug (I'll need steps to reproduce and fix). Most importantly, there are safeguards to recover local snapshots (if used soon).

Clean, productive, task management
Good software gets out of your way and provides clean, clear pathways to accomplish your goals. Plain org does exactly that for task management. It also happens to be compatible with org-mode, which makes it especially useful for Emacs users. Regardless of your org-mode experience level, Plain org presents you with an elegant interface for managing your task list along with the core features org-mode is revered for (statuses, nested tasks, tags, and more).

gorgeous implementation of org-mode on iOS
This is a gorgeous implementation of org-mode on iOS. It is rather spartan in functionality and options, which may be a draw for long-time Emacs users used to customizing everything under the sun, but makes org-mode more accessible and user-friendly for everyone else. Even I, the world's best Emacs user, very much appreciate the elegance and cleanness of the interface, and all of the features that the developer chose to implement work really well. I am also impressed by how closely the developer listens to feedback and how quickly changes are implemented. Kudos!

Recently purchased on a whim as I’ve been looking for a task management solution where I could make heavy use of text but still find it usable and easy to interface with on a phone.

I love the streamlined design
I’m following GTD on org files and Plain Org is the best app I’ve found for capturing. And it can sync with anything that exposes a files API (eg my NextCloud).

Once tags filtering is implemented, I’ll be able to use it for much more of my GTD workflow.

Excellent app for editing Org-mode files
I’ve been testing this app for a few months now, and have been extremely impressed with how much the developer has worked to quickly add new features. It has the best UI for working with Org-mode agenda files that I’ve seen outside of Emacs itself. As soon as I saw that it was available on the App Store, I deleted my test versions and gladly paid for it. I’m grateful for the opportunity to send $8.99 to someone who has worked extremely hard to produce something I’ve needed for years.

I've been using Org-mode for more than a decade and I've tried all kinds of other iOS apps in an attempt to make my Org files accessible on my iPhone / iPad. This is the first app that does this beautifully and in a way that feels intuitive. The developer is very friendly, responsive, and quick to implement fixes and I look forward to new releases!
