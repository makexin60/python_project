About this privacy statement
About this privacy statement
This privacy statement sets out how we handle your personal data. You can be confident that we handle your personal data with due care.
ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and your personal data
For some of the bank's apps, websites or services, the use of personal data may differ from what we describe in this privacy statement. For example, you are a job applicant or a user of the Tikkie app. In those cases, you will find a different privacy statement in the app or on the website Or you will receive additional information with the specific (online) service. We think it is important that you are aware of this and are not surprised.
Who is this privacy statement intended for?
This privacy statement tells you how we handle your personal data. Every time you make a payment, receive money, use internet banking, use our ABN AMRO app, email, chat, telephone us, or fill in and submit a form, for example when applying for a mortgage or personal loan, you are sharing data with us. You can trust us to do so with care.
We think it is important that you are aware of this and are not surprised. In addition, we may process personal data of persons who do not have an agreement with us. For example, when we capture - and use - personal data of contact persons at companies to whom we provide our services. Of shareholders of these companies, or Ultimate Beneficiary Owners (UBOs) of these companies. We may also process data of individuals who, for example, act as guarantors for our clients.
This privacy statement is available online and easily accessible. Do you have a company that is a client of ours? And does this company have shareholders, contacts who correspond about your company or UBOs? If so, please provide this privacy notice to them. Then these persons can easily find out how we handle their personal data. To enable payments, we process personal data of persons with whom we do not have an agreement. For example, consider the details of the person to whom you transfer money and who has a bank account with another bank. Are you one of these individuals? Then this privacy notice is also meant for you.
