        the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
5.3 Limitations of Security Measures
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of

We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
        Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require keeping your personal information for longer
        than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

The information may be kept to maintain the continuity of our services, including the enhancements and
        user-experience improvements of the App.
In some cases, you may request that we delete your data, in which case we will respond to your request based on
        the conditions and restrictions outlined in Article 7 (Your Data Protection Rights).
6.3 Deletion of Data
We regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data. Information that is no longer needed for any legal or
        operational purpose will be periodically deleted or anonymized, thus minimizing the data we hold.
Users may request the deletion of their account and associated data. Upon verification of such requests, we will
        proceed to remove the userâ€™s personal information from our active databases and, where applicable, from our
        backup systems to the extent possible based on our backup policy and legal obligations.
6.4 Exceptions to Deletion
There may be circumstances in which we cannot delete your personal information, particularly where its retention
        is required for compliance with a legal obligation, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
        interests of another natural person.
