information, we will only receive confirmation from your Device that the

unique identifier (VUID)
, the make, model, model year, features,
registration number, date of purchase or lease, and the authorised retailer
from whom you purchased or leased the vehicle.
·
Location Information
: In order to provide you with
the InControl Services it is necessary for us and our service providers to make
use of location data sent from your vehicle, including information about its
last parked location. In order for your authorized third party service
providers to provide your requested services (set up and manage your vehicle
intelligent home charging schedule, etc.), it is necessary for us to share your
vehicle default charging location . We will also collect and process other
location information about the vehicle at any point in time as part of the
“journey tracking” function (“
Journeys
”) of the InControl Services. The
information that we will collect and process as part of this function is set
out in “Journey Information” below. The last parked location of the vehicle
will always be tracked and cannot be switched off for the period you receive
InControl Services. Subject to this, you are able to switch off Journeys at any
time via the My InControl website and the InControl Remote App. If, however,
the “SOS Emergency Call”, the “Optimised Assistance” or the “InControl Secure
Tracker / Secure Tracker Pro” function is activated, real-time location data
relating to the vehicle will be activated automatically upon occurrence of a
relevant trigger event, such as your vehicle being towed away with the ignition
off, moved in a way that triggers “InControl Secure Tracker / Secure Tracker
Pro” or the deployment of your vehicle’s airbags respectively, and sent to the
relevant service provider and/or emergency services (as appropriate) even if
you have switched off Journeys. For full details of the relevant trigger events
please refer to the vehicle handbook. Location Information is also necessary
(separate to “Journey Information” functionality), for use of certain InControl
Services and Feature functionality including: locating your vehicle on a map
and getting walking directions back to it, and locating your vehicle in a
crowded car park with the ‘beep and flash’ functionality.
Even if you have
not activated your InControl Services account,
the
vehicle may automatically initiate a call to contact emergency services via the
limited emergency call function or you may be able to manually initiate a voice
call for emergency services via the limited emergency call function. The
occurrence of such a call may transmit information, including vehicle location,
time, and a vehicle identifier to us and/or our emergency service providers as
described in your vehicle handbook which can be found here:
https://www.ownerinfo.jaguar.com
and
https://www.ownerinfo.landrover.com
·
Journey
Information
: information about your journey sent from your
vehicle including the journey distance, real-time location, the duration of the
journey, the average speed and data about the efficiency of the journey. As
referred to above, you can turn off Journeys via the My InControl website and
the InControl Remote App. This will prevent any of the above information from
being sent from the vehicle (except for the last parked location). As stated
above, if, however, the “SOS Emergency Call”, the “Optimised Roadside Assistance”
or the “InControl Secure Tracker / Secure Tracker Pro” function is activated,
location data of the vehicle will be sent to the relevant service provider
and/or the emergency services (as appropriate) even if you have switched off
Journeys.

  about JLRs network of Independent Third Parties ...
We
  work with a number of independent third parties to provide services, such as
  our Retail Network, credit product providers and contract hire products.
   Personal data may be sent directly to these entities by you (for

  send an email) and any data you provide to them in use of their websites,
  will be controlled by them, not by JLR. If you have questions regarding a
  third party’s (such as a retailer, importer, credit provider, contract hire
  product provider or repairer's) use of your personal data, we recommend you
  contact those parties directly.

INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS.
The data that we collect from you will be stored in the
United Kingdom (UK) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”)
and/or other countries to the extent
required for us or our service providers to provide the vehicle and InControl
Services.
It may be processed by personnel operating outside the UK and
the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers, including those
engaged in the provision of the InControl Services. Where personal data is
shared outside of the UK and/or the EEA, we apply safeguards to add to the data
protections that apply to those data transfers. This includes an assessment of
the adequacy of the third country in question, use of European Commission
approved (or where applicable, UK approved) model contract terms where
appropriate, and assessment of Privacy Shield certification for US located
entities (where this is deemed as an adequate method of transfer).

…
  about the adequacy checks JAGUAR LAND ROVER puts in place for international
  data transfers …
Where
  JAGUAR LAND ROVER chooses to share personal data with a third party located
  outside the EU, the following factors are assessed to support adequate
  transfer of this data:
Internal checks to identify the existence or absence
       of any applicable adequacy decision by the European Commission.
We have group companies, and use suppliers located in countries that
       have been approved by the European Commission as having essentially
       equivalent data protection laws. A full list of these countries as at
       the date of this Privacy Policy is: Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe
       Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Switzerland, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand,
       Uruguay and the Isle of Man. (The EU-US Privacy Shield programme is
       described below). This list and information about the protections the
       European Commission has considered is available here:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en
.
Use of measures like European Commission approved
       measures to support adequate transfers of personal data.
We also have group companies, and use suppliers located in countries
       that are elsewhere in the world. To manage data protection compliance
       with these transfers, we will use European Commission or UK approved
       data transfer mechanisms such as use of approved model contractual
       clauses. We will also assess, where applicable, where a supplier is able
       to demonstrate to us they have Binding Corporate Rules. (Binding
       Corporate Rules is a GDPR – recognised Data Protection mechanism to
       ensure adequate personal data transfers). We may work with suppliers who
       are able to demonstrate to us they are Privacy Shield certified and
       where this is deemed as an adequate method of transfer.
To understand the protections
        required in European Commission approved Model Clauses, a template copy
        of these is available here:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
