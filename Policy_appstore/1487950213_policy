Analytics
We aggregate personal information and remove any identifying elements in order to analyse patterns and improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse Platform use, to improve our content and products and services, to customize our Platforms’ content, layout, products and services, and to support our business operations and we may appoint third parties to do this on our behalf, as set out above in
Sharing personal information with others
.
We gather certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to our Platforms. This information includes which webpage you just came from, which webpage you next go to, what browser you are using, your device ID and your IP address. This collective data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of our Platforms, and do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you. One of the ways we do this is by installing and using Cookies on your browser or device. You can find out more about cookies and our Cookie Policy in the section entitled
Cookies
below.
If you use buttons on our Platforms linked to social media or similar sites (for example, "Like" and/or "Share" buttons), content from our Platforms may be sent back to those sites and, depending on your privacy settings, may be privately or publicly visible (for example, to friends, followers or generally to anyone who has access to your profile page).
Profiling
We use personal information such as your date of birth, gender, country of residence, transactions (for example, payments made with us, mileage and flights taken), information derived from Cookies and your preferences for profiling. Some of the legitimate purposes we profile personal information include:

Where required under applicable privacy laws:
we will take steps to ensure that prior to profiling your personal information for a legitimate interest that our legitimate interest is not overridden by your own interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; and
you may have rights to object to us profiling your personal information. You can learn more about such rights in
Legal rights available to help manage your privacy
.
The Emirates Group is a global business, which means your personal information may be transferred and stored in the United Arab Emirates and other countries which may be outside your country of residence. Some of these countries are subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence.
We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, and we only transfer personal information to another country where:
we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect your information; and
the transfers are fully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights.
To this end:
we ensure transfers within the Emirates Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Emirates Group (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Emirates Group;
where we transfer your personal information outside the Emirates Group or to third parties (who help us to provide our products and services), we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information; or
where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully review and validate these requests before any personal information is disclosed.
In the event your personal information is transferred to a foreign jurisdiction, it may be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction and we may be required to disclose it to the courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities in those jurisdictions.
You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.
For residents of Australia, your personal information may be transferred to the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and where our servers are located from time to time, along with where you are travelling to or from or as required by law.
Protection of your personal information
We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to protect the personal information that you share with us and safeguard the privacy of such information. For example, the measures we take include:
placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members and service providers;
destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
following security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it; and
using secure communication channels such as SSL ("secure sockets layer") or TLS (“transport layer security”) for transmitting data that is sent to us. SSL and TLS are industry standard encryption protocols used to protect online transaction channels.
As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect user IDs and passwords, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.
Here are some simple steps you can take to ensure your personal information is kept securely:
keep your booking reference confidential ‑ upon making a booking a unique booking reference (also known as a PNR or Passenger Name Record) will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. It is important that you keep your booking reference confidential at all times. Other persons may be able to access your booking details through our system if you disclose your booking reference to them;
if you are travelling in a group and would prefer that your individual booking details are not available to other passengers you may choose to have each person make a separate booking (to be paid for individually);
keep your Skywards number / Business Rewards number / Customer log‑in details confidential. You should not share your log in details with anyone else. You should also log out when you finish using our Platforms. This is especially important if you are using a publicly accessible computer; and
be aware of "Phishing", which is where someone tries to represent themselves as someone else to gain information from you ‑ always check whether emails from any sender are actually from them, and if in doubt, go directly to their website and do not click on links in emails, as these may take you to "clone" websites which use your information illegally.
Storage of your personal information
We keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, to manage bookings and provide you with any relevant Emirates products or services, as explained in this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner.
In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for example, where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.
If you require further information about how we retain particular information please contact us.

Biometrics are the human characteristics that make up an individual’s identity like facial features, eyes, and even the heartbeat. These can be used to determine who you are. We’re using facial recognition as it is an effective form of biometric authentication.
It’s a new development in technology designed to make your travel safer, smoother and more efficiently. We use your unique features to recognise you at every step of your journey. Register at check‑in and you can use the biometric lanes in Emirates Terminal 3 First Class and Business Class at Dubai International. We’re the first airline to trial biometric recognition, throughout the customer journey, at check‑in, immigration and at our lounges.
The initial rollout will be available to select First Class and Business Class passengers. Once contacted, these passengers will be asked to register. Feedback gathered from this initial rollout will help us improve this service, and later implement it for Economy Class passengers as well.
All biometric data will be stored with the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigner Affairs (GDRFA) in compliance with GDPR rules and will be used across the airport for identification purposes.
To help you breeze through immigration, our lounges and more. This technology is revolutionary – it recognises you while you’re on the move. By using it, we’re making the process more secure and improving your travel experience.
As part of your biometric check‑in, lounge access and boarding process (the “biometric path”), we’ll need to process your personal information, including biometric information. The privacy statement briefly explains how we collect, use and store this information. Registering for the biometric path is optional.
