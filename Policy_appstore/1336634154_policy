Secure ShellFish
is designed to keep your information private. 
        It does this by collecting very little information, using as few third party services 
        as possible and end-to-end encrypting data when possible.
The servers your configure are shared between your different devices using iCloud if 
        you have
iCloud Keychain
enabled. Files and directories you tag or mark as favourite are 
        shared between your devices if you are logged into iCloud. Snippets are stored in iCloud 
        in encrypted form with the key stored in  iCloud Keychain.
The app collects usage data to determine the popularity of features and to detect user 
        interactions causing confusion. This is done without recording personal information and 
        without any details from your servers. We collect that you started a server terminal and 
        whether it succeeded or failed without collecting server information or error details.
Usage data is recorded using
TelemetryDeck
. 
	    When
Location Persistence
is enabled location data is collected while 
	    using the terminal. Location data never leaves the device.
This website will log requests to the server, the document requested and the

The
notify
and
widget
commands use this server and Apple push notification 
	    servers to deliver payload to devices running Secure ShellFish. Payload is encrypted with a 
	    secret key known only by
notify
and
widget
commands and your app installation.
