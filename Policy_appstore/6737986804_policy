App Icon Maker
by Jack Finnis
About
Create beautiful app icons for your personal apps in seconds. Easily differentiate the apps you are developing on your phone. Export icons in PNG format and paste them directly into your Xcode project. Export icon layers separately for visionOS.
Support
Do not submit apps to the App Store using app icons created using this app. They use Apple's SF Symbols and your app will be rejected. Only use these app icons to easily differentiate apps you are developing privately on your device.
To create a new app icon, tap on the plus button at the top right of the home screen. You can only personalise the icon shape, symbol, symbol size and background colour. This is to maintain a consistent icon style and save your time tweaking.
