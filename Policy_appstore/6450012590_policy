What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device by a web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) that
hold information about your previous visits to our site and may contain personal data relating to
you. We use this information to offer you a more personal browsing experience and to enhance your
use of our site.
Cookies can be "first party" which are cookies set by us, or "third-party" which are cookies that are
placed on your device by a third party when you visit our site.
Third-party cookies may be placed on your device by a third party providing a service to us. These
cookies are placed by trusted third parties (such as advertising networks) who we have a
relationship with. They remember that you have visited a website and what pages you have viewed.
Information within the cookie is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. These third
parties may combine data which we share with data from other sources such as other websites or
mobile applications. This combined data may then be used to ensure that we can better target you
with products and services that are relevant to you.
For more information on privacy, personal data and cookies, visit
www.dataprotection.ie
and
http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm
. For more
information on how we process your personal data, please read our
Privacy Notice
.
How we use cookies
We use cookies to give you the best experience on our site, including website improvements and
remembering interactions and preferences so we can give you an improved service, provide social
media features and to analyse traffic. A more detailed description of the different types of cookies
we use is set out in the Types of cookies section. If you've ever placed items in your basket, had to leave our site and
returned later to find the items still in your basket, this is an example of one of our cookies in
action. Cookies also ensure that any adverts you see online both on our site and on third party
websites will be more relevant to your interests.
Why are we telling you this?
To ensure you are completely aware of the types of cookies we use and to enable us to continue to
bring you the best possible shopping experience, we are giving you a detailed description of the
cookies we use and their unique role in your shopping experience. Any updates to this policy will be
posted to this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure you are happy with our
use of cookies. You can update your cookie preferences at any time within our
Privacy Preference Centre.
Types of cookies
Strictly necessary cookies
- These cookies are necessary for us to manage how our
site behaves, enable you to navigate our site and gain full access to its features and secure areas
and to provide you with a secure, reliable and safe site. Without these cookies essential services
you have asked for like ‘Your Basket' cannot be provided. For this reason, we do not need to obtain
your consent to use these cookies, without which, our site would not function properly.
Performance cookies
- These cookies remember information about how you and other
customers use our site. This gives us vital information such as which pages are visited most often
and if customers are receiving error messages from certain pages. The role of these cookies is to
allow us to analyse and improve the performance of our site and determine the content and services
visitors to our site value most. Performance cookies (also known as web analytic cookies) don't
collect any information that identifies the customer and all information collected is aggregated and
therefore anonymous. To use these cookies which ensure you receive a consistent look, feel and
shopping experience, we need to obtain your consent.
Functional cookies
- These cookies remember choices you made on previous visits to
our site such as your username, language or region so we can provide enhanced functionality and
personalisation. They can also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts and other
parts of web pages you can customise. Functional cookies can also be used to provide services you
have previously asked for such as watching videos or remembering your email address on our login
page. The information collected by these cookies may be anonymised and they cannot track your
browsing activity on other sites. We do require your consent to place these cookies and store your
personal preferences.
Targeting (advertising) cookies
- These cookies do require your consent and are used
to help us deliver adverts more relevant to your personal interests. Alongside this they limit the
amount of times you see an advert and measure the effectiveness of adverts. This means you won't
keep seeing irrelevant adverts or the same adverts over and over.
Social media cookies
- These cookies also require your consent and are set by a
range of social media services (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat) that
we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They
are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests.
This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. More information on
how we process your personal data and who this is shared with is contained in our
Privacy Notice
.
Managing your cookie preferences and consent
When you visit our site, only those cookies described as "Strictly Necessary" in the 
Types of cookies section are placed on your device. For all other non-necessary
(also described in the Types of cookies section) your consent is required. These
non-necessary cookies help to maximise the visitor experience.
The cookie banner
You can consent to the use of these non-necessary cookies by clicking on "Accept All Cookies" on our
cookie banner when you arrive to the site.
Alternatively, you can opt out of certain or all non-necessary cookies by clicking on "Cookie
Settings" on the cookie banner. This will take you to our Privacy Preference Centre to select your
preferences. Blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services
we are able to offer.
Privacy preference centre
You can also select or update your cookie preferences at any time within the
Privacy Preference Centre
. By clicking "Allow All" you
agree to our use of all cookies, alternatively you can opt-out of each cookie category (except
strictly necessary cookies) through the Privacy Preference Centre under “Manage Consent
Preferences”. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the
services we are able to offer.
AdChoices
Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the
other organisations that generate the advert. In line with Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB)
guidelines, all our adverts carry the clearly displayed AdChoices
icon. Clicking the AdChoices icon will give you access to information
about privacy and behavioural advertising and allow you to quickly opt-out of receiving further
adverts. For more information visit
www.youradchoices.com
or to learn more about the IAB’s Online Behavioural
Advertising Framework
click here
. Please note that opting out of receiving adverts from one
browser, device or app will not necessarily opt you out of all such adverts from all browsers,
devices or apps.
Consent management
We will record your preferences (consent) and will reaffirm preferences every six months. The consent
management tool specifically controls performance, functional, targeting/advertising and social
media cookies set by using our site. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled, nor can the tool
be used to block cookies on third-party websites linked from our site.
Using your browser
It is possible to stop your browser accepting cookies from particular websites. However, disabling
cookies from our site will mean you lose certain functionality, which will impact your shopping
experience and ability to place an order.
If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll only be able to browse the site. It is not possible to
login, register or add to basket without cookies enabled. Many of the cookies used on our site and
through emails can be enabled or disabled through the
Privacy Preference Centre.
or by enabling or disabling the
cookies through your own browser. To enable or disable cookies through your browser, follow the
instructions usually located within the “Help,” “Tools” or “Edit” menus in your browser.
Please note that disabling a cookie or category of cookies does not delete the cookie from your
browser unless manually completed through your browser function.
Deleting cookies
Collection of your data from our analytics cookies can be deleted. If cookies are deleted from your
browser, the information collected prior to the preference change may still be used, however, we
will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information from your user experience.
Cookie list
Below is a full list of cookies employed (by category)and how long they persist (retention periods). For more detailed information and a full list of cookies employed (by category), their purpose, description of individual cookies and how long they persist please visit our
Privacy Preference Centre.
or select “Cookie Settings” on the cookie banner.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms and are also set to ensure a secure, reliable and safe site. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.

3. Why We Need Your Personal Data
We need to process your personal data for a number of different reasons, and these are our legal bases for processing. We also need to keep your personal data for as long as is necessary for us to operate our business and to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We rely on one or more of the following legal bases for processing personal data:
To perform our contract with you or to enter into a contract with you
We need to process your personal data to fulfil our contract with you or to assess whether to enter into a contract with you, whether this is in selling and delivering goods and services to you or providing credit facilities or other financial services products to you.
To fulfil our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party
When we process personal data to fulfil our legitimate interests, we will use it in a way in which you would reasonably expect, and which will have a minimal privacy impact. When we or third parties are relying on legitimate interests to process your data, we will balance our interests against your interests and the privacy impact of the processing on you and we will process your personal data responsibly.
Examples of our legitimate interests are: fraud prevention, preventing and investigating crime including financial crimes, assessing affordability and creditworthiness and IT security.
To comply with legal obligations to which our business is subject
We have to comply with relevant laws and regulation in order to provide retail and financial services products and we will need to process your personal data in order to comply with these legal obligations.
Consent
If we are relying on your consent as our legal basis to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
Please see Section 6 below, “Your Rights”, for details on how to exercise your rights.
4. Storage Limitation
We will keep your personal data for the purposes set out in this privacy notice and only for as long as any legal basis continues to apply. Below is a list of the main reasons we need to retain your personal data:
Compliance with the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland, or other relevant Authority
Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Regulations

To assist with the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims
The length of time we need to keep the personal data will vary depending on the nature of the personal data and the reason we are obliged to hold it. The retention period for customer data is 7 years from the date a customer account becomes inactive (14 months after the date of the last financial transaction). We will apply appropriate risk-based measures to protect your personal data which may include pseudonymising or anonymising the personal data. If personal data is pseudonymised, this means it is de-identified so you are no longer identifiable, but we can re-identify you if we have a requirement to do so. If personal data is anonymised, it is de-identified, but can never be re-identified in the future.

Transfers outside the EEA
We sometimes need to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA for example to the United Kingdom. For this type of transfer, we have Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in place, or alternatively we will rely on the European Commission’s Adequacy Decision. Standard contractual clauses are contractual measures that are pre-approved by the European Commission which ensure the appropriate safeguarding of that data on the side of the data exporter and data receiver. Recently, the European Commission has updated SCCs to be more comprehensive and afford greater protection. For further information about data transfers and specific contractual mechanisms in place, please see below at section 10.
Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to 'international frameworks' intended to enable secure data sharing.
6. Your Rights
You have certain rights in respect of your personal data and we have processes to enable you to exercise these rights.
Right of Access
This is known as a Subject Access Request. If you want to know if we are processing personal data relating to you and to have access to any such personal data, you can call our Customer Services Team on 1800811222. In order to supply you with your personal data that we hold, we will need to verify your identity.
Right to Rectification
If you believe that we hold inaccurate personal data about you, then you can update this information directly by logging in to My Account and updating the relevant details. Alternatively, you can request that we carry out a review and rectify any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you by calling our Customer Services Team on 1800811222. Depending on the type of personal data you believe is inaccurate, we may ask you for further proof to ensure that the personal data is being corrected properly. If we are satisfied that the personal data is inaccurate, we will make the necessary changes.
Right to Erasure
You have a right to ask for your personal data to be erased. However, we are not required to erase your data where we need your personal data to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Therefore, we cannot comply with an erasure request, for example, where you have a retail shopping account, owe money on a credit facility or have otherwise bought products and services for which we must keep records. In addition, if you opt-out of marketing communications or have previously opted out of marketing communications, we have to keep a record or such opt-out to ensure that we don't contact you in the future.
Right to Restriction
You have a right to request that processing of personal data is restricted in certain circumstances. Where we restrict your data, we are permitted to store your data but we cannot process in any other way apart from for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or with your consent.
Right to Object
Where we are relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis to process your data, you have a right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation.
If you object to our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, we will opt you out of direct marketing. You can do this by logging into My Account and amending your preferences or you can call our Customer Services Team on 1800811222. You may also object to other processing when we rely on our legitimate interests as the basis for processing, but we do not have to stop the processing if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing (taking into account our processing activities, the nature of our business and our legitimate interests) and that these grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms or in the event that we need the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. To enable us to consider any objection we will need to know what specific interests, rights or freedoms relating to your particular situation you believe will potentially be put at risk by our processing. If we do stop processing your personal data (apart from for direct marketing purposes), this may affect our ability to trade with you.
Automated Processing
From time to time, in deciding whether to enter into a contract with you, or during the ongoing performance of a contract, we take decisions based on automated processing which produces legal affects or similarly significantly affects you, for example, deciding whether to offer a credit facility or assessing a fraud risk. We use data from a variety of sources in our automated processing for credit scoring and fraud decisioning and we use statistical methods to produce the results. This logic helps us understand the risk posed by individuals by placing a weighting on certain criteria which is then calculated to give an overall score.
There are a number of consequences of such automated processing:
we may open a credit account and you can purchase goods and services using this credit account;
we may decrease your credit limit;
we may decide to offer you other credit terms such as buy now pay later or interest free credit which will facilitate your purchase of goods and services;
we may refuse your application for credit or we may decide not to offer certain credit products which may have an impact on your ability to purchase goods and services from us. This is in line with our obligations as a responsible lender as we have to assess affordability for credit purposes and to protect customers from financial distress and difficulty;
we may conduct a further review or request additional information from you in relation to your request to purchase goods and services if our fraud decisioning highlights any issues.
We also use automated processing in relation to the information we hold about you to make recommendations of products and services we think you would be interested in and to improve your experience when you visit our website by making it relevant and tailored to you.
Right to Portability
In certain circumstances, you can request that we provide to you your personal data in a commonly used format. If you wish to make such a request, you can call our Customer Services Team on 1800811222.
Right to Complain to the Data Protection Commission (DPC)
You have the right to complain to the Data Protection Commission (DPC) if you are concerned about the way we have processed your personal information. Please visit the DPC's website for further details at:
www.dataprotection.ie
7. Credit Applications
In order to process your credit application and during our relationship with you, where a credit account exceeds a certain limit, we will share information with third parties including credit reference agencies or registers. Under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 we are required to share information on qualifying credit applications and agreements with the Central Credit Register ('CCR'). To do this, we will supply your personal (such as PPSN) and credit (amount of the loan) information to the CCR and they will give us information about you. This will include information about your financial situation and financial history. The CCR will also link your records together to create a Single Borrower View.
The CCR provides a reliable and secure source of credit information, showing an accurate picture of your qualifying loans and guarantees reported which will facilitate enhanced creditworthiness assessments and responsible lending.
We will continue to exchange information about you with the CCR while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CCR about your settled and closed accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, the CCR requires us to report on any restructure during the lifecycle of the agreement due to arrears or financial distress. This information may be supplied to other organisations by the CCR.
When the CCR receives a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.
You may request a credit report free of charge once a year. Further information can be found in the Consumer Area
www.centralcreditregister.ie
Fraud Prevention/Anti-Money Laundering
Before we provide services, goods or financing to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. We ask you to verify your ID digitally to help protect you from financial crime and to meet our anti-money laundering obligations as a financial services provider regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. We do this by using automated systems and services provided by trusted third parties who help us to verify identity and prevent certain types of fraud.
8. What Data we Process and Share
The personal data you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have received from third parties may include your:
name
date of birth
nationality (only where you have had to supplement ID)
gender (only where you have had to supplement ID)
residential address and address history (only where you have had to supplement ID/apply for credit with SDI)
contact details such as email address and telephone numbers
financial information (only where you apply for credit with SDI)
employment details (only where you apply for credit with SDI)
identifiers assigned to your computer or other internet connected device including your Internet Protocol (IP) address
Eircodes (required to enable us deliver good to you as quickly and accurately as possible)
When we and fraud prevention agencies process your personal data, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also necessary to enable us to enter into and perform our contracts with you.
We, and our processors acting on our behalf (including fraud prevention and delivery companies) may share and enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.
9. Automated decisions
As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we use this to determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if:
our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or
you appear to have deliberately hidden your identity
You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more, please contact our Customer Services Team on 1800811222.
Consequences of Processing
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details above.
