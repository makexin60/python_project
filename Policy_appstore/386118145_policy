System Monitor
System Monitor is a complete iPhone/iTouch/iPad monitoring App, that lets you know about the current memory in use and free.
Memory usage
This shows you information about used and free memory and it also frees your memory when ever it is opened (for all device models), or brought into focus. So if your are running in low memory, your apps will crash frequently and you have to restart your phone to solve this. Now with System Monitor App, you just open this app and select memory tab, you will see the App frees memory for you.
Battery usage
Lets you know about the battery level and gives you detailed view about how long you could use your device without recharging based on your battery health. It also allow you to specify your battery health.
Realtime graph
Real time graphs helps you identify the spikes caused by any of the Apps. They provide a real time view of the memory usage by your iOS device. Shows the real time break up of 'Wired', 'Active', 'Free', and 'Inactive' memory. Flexible time scale axis view.
Disk space used
Provides pie chart that shows the total, used and free disk space. Disk space is the storage memory where your apps, music and other files gets stored, your device may have 16GB/32GB/64GB/128GB of disk space.
System information
Lets you know about your device's unique id, MAC address, IP Address, device name and model, OS Version, and Bus Frequency and your device's last boot time i.e. last time when you switched on your device.

Lots and lots of info without having to dig through settings and much that can't be found anywhere else on the phone.

I would not like to be without it gives me all the ongoing information I need to keep my iPhone in tip top order.

Exactly what I needed

It warns me when the battery starts to die\

I used to use "Simple Status" but it took a couple of steps to free up memory. With "System Monitor" you just open the app.
Perfent
Shows a lot of good system info but I dont need to use it often.
skyfly55
It's not a must-have app, but it's very nicely done and has some useful info, some of which might be hard (or impossible?) to find otherwise. There are a few places where the UX fails, such as when the storage FREE percentage is next to the word "USED".

This App is a gem and provides extremely useful information about my device all in one place, though I can get it from Apple’s phone settings or other places on the website. The information is so wonderfully organised that I can see all of it one place about by iPad and iPhone, starting from hardware specs to motion processor and camera details. As stated in the description, the App also helps me to free memory by dismissing unused apps and leaving the System monitor open in the home screen for a few seconds ! Useful battery tips as well.

what does the u.s. iTunes app store have against system optimizer apps, system memory refreshing apps, & battery boosting apps? seriously! every time i find one that does it all, inevitably the app store phases it out. these types of utilities are readily available in every other store, but not in the u.s. store. it's as though apple doesn't want it's customers to be able to enjoy the benefits of this type of utility, and they don't have the right to decide that for their customers. (and yet they have done just that) hasn't anyone out there noticed this? i cannot be the only person.

If your iPhone is running slow, or is hanging up while playing Risk or Monoploy, punch up this excellent app which mimics the gadget on Windows 7.  Instantly know by easy-to-read dials when to free memory, etc! Then you can use whatever memory-freeing app you have to speed up your system! Cool!

Get it.
