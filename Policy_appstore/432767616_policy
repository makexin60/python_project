							the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

							law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

							of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement
							shall govern.

							conditions posted at such time. You acknowledge and agree that you accept this Agreement (and any
							amendments thereto) each time you load, access, or use the software.

							that of an end user of the software and services provided.

							which money damages alone would be inadequate. In addition to damages, and any other remedies to which
							Music Tribe may be entitled, you acknowledge and agree that we may seek injunctive relief to prevent the
							actual, threatened, or continued breach of this Agreement.
Limitation of Time to File Claims
