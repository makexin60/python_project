We comply with the principles laid down by the applicable laws and regulations and the generally applied principles of honesty, integrity and transparency, when processing personal data.
2.2. Ensuring the accuracy of personal data, and updating personal data when necessary
We periodically check and update the personal data processed regarding the relevant groups of data subjects, and take any and all reasonable measures to ensure that such data is accurate and up to date at all times. Accordingly we develop systems aiming at checking the accuracy of, and accordingly correcting, personal data. Our members may change and update their personal data by accessing their account at

We process personal data for specific, clear and lawful purposes. This Policy sets forth the details of the purposes for which the data is to be processed.
2.4. Processing Personal Data only for, limited to, and in proportion with the intended purpose
We process personal data only for, limited to, and in proportion with the intended purpose, and refrain from processing any personal data irrelevant to or unnecessary for such purpose.
2.5. Retaining Personal Data as long as required under the applicable legislation or for the purpose of processing
MODANİSA retains Personal Data only as long as required under the applicable legislation or for the purpose of processing. Accordingly we check whether the applicable legislation prescribes a certain period for retaining personal data, and retain personal data for such period, if any. In the event that there is no such prescribed period, then we retain personal data only as long as required for the purpose of processing. Once the prescribed period expires, or the reasons for processing personal data no longer apply, we delete, destroy or anonimyze personal data in accordance with MODANİSA’s Policy for Retaining and Destroying Personal Data, unless there is a legal requirement requiring otherwise. This Policy gives the details of these retention requirements.
2.6. Integrity, and Confidential Treatment, of Personal Data
Personal data is processed by taking any and all technical and administrative measures to ensure such data’s security, including, but not limited to those affording protection against unauthorized or illegal processing, or accidental loss, destruction or damage.

3.2. Physical Impossibility of Getting Data Subject’s Explicit Consent, or Requirement to Process Personal Data for Protecting Vital Interests of the Data Subject or a Third Party
In the event that a data subject’s personal data must be processed in order to protect any other person against death or injury and such data subject is not physically or legally capable of giving their consent, then such data may be processed without this consent.

Points will appear on the control panel as "points pending approval" after ordering. Pending points will be activated and made available 21 days after the order, unless refunds are made. If the product is returned after 21 days, the points will be refunded even if it is approved.
You can also earn points by completing the activities offered by My Modanisa. To find out how many points will be earned from which activities, you can review the "My Modanisa" control panel on the "My Account" page.
Members can earn various points by following, liking, sharing products and seasonal competitions on their Facebook and Instagram accounts. The points earned for each activity will be announced to the Members on the point earning screen beforehand.
