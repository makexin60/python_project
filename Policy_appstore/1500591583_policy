Privacy Policy
Last modified: May 2024
INTRODUCTION
Logic Fusion LLC, a company registered and acting under the laws of the United States (“Logic Fusion”, “Company”, ”we, “us”, or “our”), takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains our data protection commitment and practices and describes the types of information we may process when you install and use the ‎Heart Rate Monitor - Pulse HR software application for mobile devices (”the App”, “our App”).
When we refer to personal data (or personal information), we mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data or to an identification number (“Personal Data”).
Our Privacy Policy applies to all users and others who access the App (”Users”), and Company’s websites and landing pages  (the “Website(s)”), and/or persons whose Personal Data we may process as a result of our business activities. We also refer to such persons by “you” in the text. The reference to the App and the Website(s) is the “Services”.
For the purposes of General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national legislation implementing the GDPR and, if applicable, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR (hereinafter collectively the “GDPR”), we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated. We compiled this Privacy Policy and adjusted our processes towards Personal Data in compliance with GDPR as the highest standard for the protection of our users` personal data rights.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED CAREFULLY.
SCOPE
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data obtained through our Website(s), App, or when you otherwise interact with us.
The Company’s Website and App may contain links to other websites not under our control. We are not responsible for other websites' information practices or content. You should always review the policies of third-party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with how they collect and use your information.
INFORMATION WE PROCESS
Your privacy is our high priority, so we prefer, to the maximum possible extent, using instruments that disable the collection of clearly identifiable information and provide us with information in aggregated, encrypted, anonymized, and/or pseudonymized (non-identifiable) form. However, we understand that some categories of such information we use may be deemed Personal Data, in particular, for the purposes of GDPR. With regard to such Personal Data, the rules set out in this Privacy Policy are always strictly followed.
Information that you submit
You may provide personal information directly when you use our App. This information is necessary to adequately perform the contract between you and us. Without such information, it is impossible to provide the complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services. Depending on the App's functionality, the following information can be processed:
General Information
. You may fill it in when you choose to track physical parameters for your convenience, and/or share by connecting the other app to our App:
Gender;
Date of birth or age;
Weight.
Contact Information
. You may share it when you contact us via email:
Name;
E-mail address, and any other content included in the email
Health and well-being.
The App may estimate Heart rate. This indicator is based on various metrics the App collects when executing a measurement or importing the data from Apple Health if you decide to connect Apple Health to our App. We may collect, once you allow us, the Heart rate data from Apple Health.
For measuring, the App technically accesses your camera required as a light sensor to estimate your heart rate. During a measurement, images from the camera feed are processed locally on your device and deleted immediately afterward. We cannot collect, store, or use the data contained in your camera roll.
The health and well-being information you submit is stored locally on your device. This information is never disclosed to third parties (except our authorized service providers) unless you share it yourself.
Once you uninstall the App, your personal information (including Personal Data) will be stored and used for a period needed to achieve the purposes set out in Section 4 of this Policy.
Information you submit via web landing pages.
If you access our landing pages on our Website, we may ask you to indicate some Personal Data on these pages necessary to proceed with your request to get our services. For example, you may need to indicate your age, gender, parameters, cholesterol level, desired activities, goals etc. Please note that
we will not have access
to this information, because it is not transmitted to our service providers or databases. Instead, it is processed locally in your web browser and deleted immediately after you close the landing page. If you further share your email with us or choose to install our App, we may collect and process other categories of your Personal Data as described herein.
Information you submit during the onboarding process in the App.
Our App may include functionality for personalizing the App prior to full access to the App`s features. While completing the quiz, you may need to pick or submit some categories of Personal Data, so we can personalize the App for you. At this stage,
we will not access or collect
your health, gender, age, or other sensitive information about you and it will be processed locally on your device. Instead, we will rely on a contract basis and our legitimate interest to process some technical identifiers and log information necessary for the App to function and for us to provide you with the requested service. Once you complete the onboarding process we will ask you for your consent to process the full scope of Personal Data for the purposes described in this Policy.
Other data you may submit to us.
Also, we may collect other data that you submit to us as you participate in any interactive features of our Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity, or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us.
Notice for employees.
If you are our current, formal, or prospective employee or individual subcontractor, we also ask you to provide consent for collecting education-, career-related, and other background information (“Employment information”), which we process according to this Policy and/or our notice related to processing recruitment data that is provided in your contract or as a separate document by our HR-specialists.
Other persons` Personal Data.
If you are providing information (including Personal Data) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information collected automatically
Information from the App.
When you use the App, information about your device and user behavior may be collected and processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. However, a set of this information may allow us to identify you as a separate user of our Services, therefore we treat such information as Personal Data and protect it as prescribed by law. We process Personal Data based on the contract between you and us or our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data, we may not be able to provide you with all the App`s features. To process your Personal Data for our marketing purposes, we rely either on legitimate interest or your consent basis, as the case may be.
Device Details.
When you use a mobile device to access our App, some details about your device are reported subject to your privacy choices as provided by iOS functionality. For example, device identifiers and other metadata. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, uniquely identifying your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting and analytics. In this regard, the following information may be collected and processed:
Information about the device itself:
type of your device, type of operating system, and its version, model, and manufacturer.
Information about the internet connection:
mobile carrier, IP address, timestamp, and duration of sessions.
Location-related information:
IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, and time zone.
Device identifiers
and
technical identifiers
(e.g. IDFA)
.
Information about the App:
name, API key (identifier for application), version, and App properties can be reported for automated processing and analysis.
Cookies and similar technologies.
When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that interest you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.
Log file information.
Log file information is automatically reported each time you request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including the time and date when you start and stop using the App and how you interact with the App.
In-app events.
When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record in-app information (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, etc.).
Please remember that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. For example, when your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in association with categorized data already recorded in its databases (e.g. your age, gender or other demographic indication). We do not control, supervise or stand surety for how the third parties process your personal data that might be collected by their means (not through our App). Any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be directed to such third parties.
Payment Information.
Apple is responsible for billing, processing, and charging for in-app purchases, handle your Personal Data and keep it safe and secure. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information.
Information received from third parties
We may also obtain information from third parties, such as:
Our authorized resellers, distributors, and partners if there is a lawful basis to do so. For example, we get analytic information from the Apple App Store.
Other third parties, such as email campaigns, marketing partners, and publicly available sources. We may use this information to enhance the information we already maintain about you, in addition to other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
We work in the cross-border area and provide our App and Services to our users around the world.
We and third-party organizations that provide data processing technologies for the Services or our third-party advertising partners may transfer the processed information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions worldwide.
If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data processing that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction. This means that your personal information can be transferred to a third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors within that third country or to an international organization where data protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same level of personal data protection as your country does.
We try to ensure that the recipient of any personal data provides proper protection of the personal data received, in accordance with the current legislation on protecting such information. By agreeing with this Policy, you agree that we may transfer your personal data to any third country, a territory, or one or more specified sectors within that third country or to the international organization.
For the purposes of data processing, we recourse to the third-party services or the hosting organizations. We take your privacy seriously and, therefore, encrypt your personal data - if possible - before sending it to our service providers. Please note that we cooperate only with those service providers that have passed our security and reliability check. If applicable, we are party to data transfer agreements/data processing addendums or equivalent legal instruments with each of our service providers, and we will (i) keep each document up to date with current law and (ii) only engage in personally identifiable information transfers from safeguards area to outside safeguards area in accordance with such an agreement or an alternative means of transfer in compliance with data protection legislation. Where we transfer your Personal Data as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data receive adequate security protection where it is processed, and your rights continue to be protected pursuant to the applicable data protection law, including through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
RETENTION
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for performing the functional service of the App and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your Personal Data that we physically access and store, you can uninstall the App or request that we erase your personal information.
Unless you demand us otherwise, we will retain your Personal Data for a period of 1 year in case you decide to re-activate the Services or re-install the App.
Even if you requested the erasure or deleted the App, some data may still be stored for a certain time period (but no longer than the storage purpose requires) if the information is necessary to comply with legal obligations (taxation, accounting, audit), or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings, prevent fraud or other malicious acts, or keep your choices about privacy, for example, if you unsubscribe from our marketing communications.
SECURITY
The security of your personal information is highly important to us. Services we use to maintain the App follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Please note that our App is available for download via authorized App Store (Apple App Store) only; if you download a copy of our App via other sources, we cannot guarantee the availability, security and proper functioning of such a product. Your access to our Services via unauthorized means will be deemed improper and entails us to act correspondingly to cease unauthorized use.
We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information.
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing. We seek your Personal Data to be encrypted with proper and strong encryption algorithms, including hashing where possible.
Please notice that by choosing and keeping your password carefully, not disclosing your password, and avoiding unauthorized access to your mobile device, you can help keep your information secure. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We do our best to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a breach of security, we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law. We will also take specific steps to address the breach as necessary in the given situation. These steps may include logging you out of all devices, resetting a password (sending you a temporary password to use), and carrying out other activities and actions that are deemed to be reasonably necessary.
If you suspect or become aware of any security incident within the Services, please let us know at
product@logicfusion.net.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
General limitation.
The Services are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under 12. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 12 without verification of parental consent, we will erase that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 12, please contact us at
product@logicfusion.net.
Limitations for users from the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The use of the Services by residents of EEA or the UK younger than 16 years old is prohibited. If you know that a person under 16 is using the Services, please contact us at
