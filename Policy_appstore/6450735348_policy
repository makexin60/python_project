Security Measures We Take to Protect Your Information
We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, however, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

Where we do share your personal information with any third parties, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties only use your personal information: (i) in compliance with this Privacy Policy; and (ii) subject to any other instructions we give them, including any appropriate confidentiality and security measures that we implement.
4. How to Access Your Information
You can access and modify the information you provided to us through your account.
If you believe your information posted on
PicStar
is not authentic or accurate and can provide us with reasonable proof regarding this, you can require us via the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy to correct these unauthentic or inaccurate information and we will use reasonable efforts to honour your request; however, we may retain an archived copy of your information as required by law and/or for record keeping purposes.
Once your account is closed or deleted, you will no longer have access to your message history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of our services. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
In some cases, we may not be able to update, amend or remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so, for example, certain requests may require disproportionate technical effort or extremely impractical, or are prohibited by law.
Since
PicStar
will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.
