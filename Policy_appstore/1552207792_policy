10. Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Tracking Technologies
When you use our Services, we and our service providers, vendors, and partners, including third parties, may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and other similar technologies to collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of our Services. However, it’s not only cookies that can be used in this way. Functions performed by a cookie can be achieved by other means, too. This Section, therefore, also applies to any similar technology that stores or accesses information on your device. This could include, for example, HTML5 local storage, local shared objects, beacons, pixels, and plug-ins. We also use third-party analytics tools (such as, but not limited to, AppsFlyer, Meta Events Manager, Firebase) to help us measure traffic and usage trends of our Services, as well as for other analytics purposes. Such analytics tools collect information via third-party SDKs incorporated into the Services, which includes information about features of the App you visit or use, your actions in the App, and information about your subscription. Such information may be used to provide content, advertising, or functionality. Third parties may also use such information for their own purposes.
For the avoidance of doubt, we do not use health and wellbeing data for advertising purposes.
Cookies.
Generally, there are many different ways to classify cookies. Most common ways are classification by duration, by provenance and by purpose.
Classified by their duration, there are Session and Persistent cookies.  Session cookies expire once you close your browser (or once your session ends). Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until you erase them or until your browser erases them, depending on the cookie’s expiration date. All cookies have an expiration date, which is commonly embedded into their code. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Classified by their provenance, there are first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies refer to cookies that Zig Coach sets and uses directly. Third-party cookies refer to cookies set by third parties (such as our analytics providers) through our Website or via server cookies.
Classified by their purpose, we use Strictly Necessary, Performance and Marketing cookies.
Strictly Necessary cookies.
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with the Website and the features you have requested, such as to allow you to log into secure areas of the Website. Because these cookies are essential for the Website and the features you have requested to work, you cannot reject them. We use such cookies for the following essential purposes:
Functionality: Optimizing and improving access to the Website
Security: Preventing fraud and detecting nonhuman (bot) traffic, including authentication and secure logins
Cookie consent: Remembering your cookie consent preferences
Analysis: Traffic scheduling and network distribution
Billing: The ability to make payments
As explained above, these cookies are strictly necessary to operate our Websites and cannot be declined. Some of these cookies have a maximum duration of 13 months.
‍
Performance cookies.
We use analytics and performance cookies to analyze how you use the Website. This helps us to:
See which pages you view most often
Analyze which region you are visiting the Website from
Observe how you interact with the content
Measure any errors that occur
Test different design ideas
The above information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Website. Some of these cookies have a maximum duration of 13 months.
‍
Marketing cookies.
These cookies help us reach you and more people like you to spread the word about the App, as well as analyze whether we do that effectively.
Zing Coach does not use cookies to collect or analyze your health information for marketing purposes.
We use marketing cookies to analyze and improve our marketing campaigns. This helps us to:
Improve our marketing campaigns, including tracking ad conversions
Identify paid search keywords
Identify the source of traffic to the Website, such as search engine, social media, or specific website
Analyze which region you are visiting the Website from
See how you interact with the content
Software Development Kits (SDKs).
SDKs are third-party software development kits that may be installed in our mobile application. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our App and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application. Our App is never used to present you with third-party advertising. You can browse with full confidence in the protection of your privacy. Access is requested with the purpose of enabling the use of our services and improving their functioning. Certain SDKs, where legally required, are subject to a prior consent request and the possibility of withdrawing this consent. Zing Coach services may still be used even in the event of refusal or withdrawal of consent.
AppsFlyer SDK: Facilitates measurement of performance and analysis of customer acquisition campaigns. Further information about AppsFlyer SDK is available at
https://www.appsflyer.com/product/security-and-privacy/
.
You can deactivate this data processing at any time via
https://www.appsflyer.com/optout
. In order to do so, you must have the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) of your mobile device. You can also withdraw your consent for the collection of data for targeted advertising or sharing their data with third-party advertisers through your device’s settings.
Advertising ID.
You can tailor your device settings to control your advertising ID:
On Apple devices, you can enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your device settings.
On Android devices, you can enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your device settings.
Interest-based Advertising.
We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of the App over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Your Choices.
Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so as to limit such technologies. You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info
to learn more about this interest-based advertising and how to opt out of this kind of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s mobile app opt-out program. You can also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/
. Opting out of receiving interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive ads from us, but rather that the ads will not be tailored to your perceived interests. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and United States.
You can manage the collection and processing of Personal Data via cookies, SDKs, and other tracking technologies by contacting us at
support@zing.coach
.
You may find that some parts of the App may not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies, and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies may prevent you from accessing some of our content. Your choices are typically device and browser-specific.

We send some of these communications to you, such as those related to your subscriptions, technical and security notices, and updates to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, where necessary to perform our contract with you to provide the App or otherwise based on our legitimate interest in contacting you.
If required by law, we will ask for your consent to send you promotional and marketing emails, in-app communications, and push notifications about new products, features, or offers related to our Services.
Marketing & Promotional Emails.

12.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

10. Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Tracking Technologies
When you use our Services, we and our service providers, vendors, and partners, including third parties, may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and other similar technologies to collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of our Services. However, it’s not only cookies that can be used in this way. Functions performed by a cookie can be achieved by other means, too. This Section, therefore, also applies to any similar technology that stores or accesses information on your device. This could include, for example, HTML5 local storage, local shared objects, beacons, pixels, and plug-ins. We also use third-party analytics tools (such as, but not limited to, AppsFlyer, Meta Events Manager, Firebase) to help us measure traffic and usage trends of our Services, as well as for other analytics purposes. Such analytics tools collect information via third-party SDKs incorporated into the Services, which includes information about features of the App you visit or use, your actions in the App, and information about your subscription. Such information may be used to provide content, advertising, or functionality. Third parties may also use such information for their own purposes.
For the avoidance of doubt, we do not use health and wellbeing data for advertising purposes.
Cookies.
Generally, there are many different ways to classify cookies. Most common ways are classification by duration, by provenance and by purpose.
Classified by their duration, there are Session and Persistent cookies.  Session cookies expire once you close your browser (or once your session ends). Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until you erase them or until your browser erases them, depending on the cookie’s expiration date. All cookies have an expiration date, which is commonly embedded into their code. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Classified by their provenance, there are first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies refer to cookies that Zig Coach sets and uses directly. Third-party cookies refer to cookies set by third parties (such as our analytics providers) through our Website or via server cookies.
Classified by their purpose, we use Strictly Necessary, Performance and Marketing cookies.
Strictly Necessary cookies.
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with the Website and the features you have requested, such as to allow you to log into secure areas of the Website. Because these cookies are essential for the Website and the features you have requested to work, you cannot reject them. We use such cookies for the following essential purposes:
Functionality: Optimizing and improving access to the Website
Security: Preventing fraud and detecting nonhuman (bot) traffic, including authentication and secure logins
Cookie consent: Remembering your cookie consent preferences
Analysis: Traffic scheduling and network distribution
Billing: The ability to make payments
As explained above, these cookies are strictly necessary to operate our Websites and cannot be declined. Some of these cookies have a maximum duration of 13 months.
‍

We use analytics and performance cookies to analyze how you use the Website. This helps us to:
See which pages you view most often
Analyze which region you are visiting the Website from
Observe how you interact with the content
Measure any errors that occur
Test different design ideas
The above information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Website. Some of these cookies have a maximum duration of 13 months.
‍
Marketing cookies.
These cookies help us reach you and more people like you to spread the word about the App, as well as analyze whether we do that effectively.

Analyze which region you are visiting the Website from

Software Development Kits (SDKs).
SDKs are third-party software development kits that may be installed in our mobile application. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our App and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application. Our App is never used to present you with third-party advertising. You can browse with full confidence in the protection of your privacy. Access is requested with the purpose of enabling the use of our services and improving their functioning. Certain SDKs, where legally required, are subject to a prior consent request and the possibility of withdrawing this consent. Zing Coach services may still be used even in the event of refusal or withdrawal of consent.
AppsFlyer SDK: Facilitates measurement of performance and analysis of customer acquisition campaigns. Further information about AppsFlyer SDK is available at
https://www.appsflyer.com/product/security-and-privacy/
.
You can deactivate this data processing at any time via
https://www.appsflyer.com/optout
. In order to do so, you must have the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) of your mobile device. You can also withdraw your consent for the collection of data for targeted advertising or sharing their data with third-party advertisers through your device’s settings.
Advertising ID.
You can tailor your device settings to control your advertising ID:
On Apple devices, you can enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your device settings.
On Android devices, you can enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your device settings.
Interest-based Advertising.
We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of the App over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Your Choices.
Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so as to limit such technologies. You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info
to learn more about this interest-based advertising and how to opt out of this kind of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s mobile app opt-out program. You can also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/
. Opting out of receiving interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive ads from us, but rather that the ads will not be tailored to your perceived interests. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and United States.
You can manage the collection and processing of Personal Data via cookies, SDKs, and other tracking technologies by contacting us at
support@zing.coach
.

Your choices are typically device and browser-specific.

If required by law, we will ask for your consent to send you promotional and marketing emails, in-app communications, and push notifications about new products, features, or offers related to our Services.
Marketing & Promotional Emails.

12.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

Security at AppsFlyer
How we ensure your data is protected
Staying ahead of the risks in an ever-evolving mobile ecosystem is crucial to the success of your business. Our platform is designed with security at the center, and backed by a dedicated team of experts who are always working to ensure your data is protected

Security is an essential part of our product inside and out. From strict checkpoints in our security development lifecycle to continuous monitoring of our infrastructure and applications, we make sure our platform is secure 24/7/365. We’ve also implemented extensive measures to make sure your experience is safe and secure every time you log in to your account.
The cloud is an extension of our business. That’s why we only work with partners like AWS and GCP who hold the same high standards security and compliance as we do. We monitor environments across data centers using multi-layered controls to help protect our infrastructure in addition to anti-DDoS protection, WAF, API protection tools, and continuous 24/7 monitoring.
Making sure your data is fresh, accurate is our number one priority. That’s why we’ve created a business continuity plan that ensures critical operations and services are always available. Our services are hosted on a globally distributed network that provides continuous activity and provide multiple backups, allowing our servers to remain resilient in the event of significant failures.
Data security is a critical part of our efforts to help both you and your users. Our web servers support strong encryption protocols to secure connections between customer devices and our web services and APIs. All data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest leaving no vulnerabilities. There are also additional advanced options such as IP masking which you can implement at any time.
“We’re always on high alert. Always. We check and recheck our activity and seek to improve ourselves in every aspect in order to protect our systems. We don’t just check boxes, we are constantly thinking about how we can expand and go beyond.”

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy.

However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

10. Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Tracking Technologies
When you use our Services, we and our service providers, vendors, and partners, including third parties, may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and other similar technologies to collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of our Services. We also use third-party analytics tools like AppsFlye, Amplitude, Meta Events Manager, Firebase, and Eppo to help us measure traffic and usage trends of our Services, as well as for other purposes. Such analytics tools collect information via third-party SDKs incorporated into the App, which includes information about features of the App you visit or use, your actions in the App, and information about your subscription. Such information may be used to provide content, advertising, or functionality.
For the avoidance of doubt, we do not use health and wellbeing data for advertising purposes.
Interest-based Advertising.
We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of the App over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Your Choices.
Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so as to limit such technologies. You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info
to learn more about this interest-based advertising and how to opt out of this kind of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and

http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

10. Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Tracking Technologies
When you use our Services, we and our service providers, vendors, and partners, including third parties, may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and other similar technologies to collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of our Services. We also use third-party analytics tools like AppsFlye, Amplitude, Meta Events Manager, Firebase, and Eppo to help us measure traffic and usage trends of our Services, as well as for other purposes. Such analytics tools collect information via third-party SDKs incorporated into the App, which includes information about features of the App you visit or use, your actions in the App, and information about your subscription. Such information may be used to provide content, advertising, or functionality.
For the avoidance of doubt, we do not use health and wellbeing data for advertising purposes.
Interest-based Advertising.
We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of the App over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Your Choices.
Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so as to limit such technologies. You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Webchoices tool at
www.aboutads.info
to learn more about this interest-based advertising and how to opt out of this kind of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA’s mobile app opt-out program. You can also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/
. Opting out of receiving interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive ads from us, but rather that the ads will not be tailored to your perceived interests.
For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and United States.
You can manage the collection and processing of Personal Data via cookies, SDKs, and other tracking technologies by contacting us at
support@zing.coach
.
You may find that some parts of the App may not function properly if you have refused cookies or similar tracking technologies, and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies may prevent you from accessing some of our content. Your choices are typically device and browser-specific.
‍
‍
11. Your Choices About Our Communications
If you are using our Services, you may receive electronic communications from us (e.g., by posting in-app notices, via push notifications or emails). We send some of these communications to you, such as those related to your subscriptions, technical and security notices, and updates to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, where necessary to perform our contract with you to provide the App or otherwise based on our legitimate interest in contacting you.
If required by law, we will ask for your consent to send you promotional and marketing emails, in-app communications, and push notifications about new products, features, or offers related to our Services.
Marketing & Promotional Emails.
If you wish to stop receiving our promotional and marketing emails, you can do so by following the “Unsubscribe” links in any marketing email sent to you.
Push Notifications
. If you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can do so through your mobile device settings by tapping “Settings” -> “Notifications” -> Choose Zing Coach -> press the toggle to allow or forbid push notifications from the App.
12.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

Privacy Policy
Effective date: Nov 6, 2023

“we”
or
“us”
) collects, stores, uses and protects your personal data in connection with your use of our website
https://zing.coach/
and our application Zing Coach™ (together referred to as the
“Services”
). This policy also explains the rights you have in respect of your personal data and the practices we implement to protect your privacy.
1. Personal data that we collect
Personal data that you provide:
•
Your account details
. This includes your name, email, your age, account credentials, subscription details, transaction history.
•
Communication information.
If you communicate with us, we collect your name, contact information, and contents of any messages you send.
•
Social Media Information.
We have pages on social media sites like Instagram. When you interact with our social media pages, we will collect the personal data that you choose to provide to us. Additionally, the companies that host our social media pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.
•
Other data that you choose to provide, including your health and wellbeing data (either provided by yourself or by means of connecting Apple Health to your account).
This may include information about your goal of using Zing application, your gender, physical parameters, information about your workout habits, any injuries you may have, data about your menstrual cycles, if applicable.
Personal data that we receive automatically from your use of the Services:

Your movements during the workout.
This means that we mark your image with certain dots to give you feedback about your results during the workout. These data are processed on your device. After the workout, we store the information about the marked dots to our servers to analyze if the technology works well and if the users fit into the screen. To avoid any doubt, we do not get access to the actual videos of your workout, but just to the dots marking your movements. These dots may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions. We will destroy these data as soon as the purpose of data collection is satisfied.
•
Your body composition information.
When you request a body composition report, we analyze the photos of your body that you choose to upload, including the information we get from the analysis, like your body position, orientation, topology, and other elements of the photo. We use this information only for the purpose of the body composition report and delete the photos and the information right after we generate the body composition report. Upon your explicit consent, however, we may store your photos and the information we get from the photos for up to one month and use them to improve our body composition function.
•
Details about your in-app purchases.
This may include, for example, details of the time you made certain purchases and your subscription details.
•
Cookies.

9. Changes to our Privacy Policy
The date this Privacy Policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this Privacy Policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

Zing Coach App Privacy Policy
Effective as of June 12, 2023
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Zing Coach, Inc. (further will be referred as
“we”
or
“us”
) collects, stores, uses and protects your Personal Data in connection with usage of our websites
https://zing-gym.coach/
,
https://zing.coach/
and our application Zing AI: Home & Gym Workouts (together referred to as the
“Services”
). This policy also explains your personal data protection rights, and we are happy to help you exercise them. We value your privacy and do our best to ensure its security.
1. Personal data that we collect
1.1
Personal data that you provide:
‍
‍
Your account details
. This includes your name, email, your age, account credentials, subscription details, transaction history.
Communication information
. If you communicate with us, we collect your name, contact information, and contents of any messages you send.
Social Media Information
. We have pages on social media sites like Instagram. When you interact with our social media pages, we will collect the personal data that you choose to provide to us. Additionally, the companies that host our social media pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.
Other data that you choose to provide, including your health and wellbeing data
. This may include information about your goal of using Zing application, your gender, physical parameters, information about your workout habits, or any injuries you may have.
‍
1.2
Personal data that we receive automatically from your use of the Services:
‍
‍
Log data
. It means the information that your browser automatically sends whenever you use our website, or whenever you access Zing Coach application. It includes the IP address, browser type, date and time of your access.
Usage details
. It includes the features you use and your actions within the Services, as well as your time zone, country, dates and times of access, operating system information.
Device information
. It includes model and type of your device, unique device identifiers, and operating system information.
Your movements during the workout
. This means that we mark your image with certain dots to give you feedback about your results during the workout. These data are processed on your device. After the workout, we store the information about the marked dots to our servers to analyze if the technology works well and if the users fit into the screen. To avoid any doubt, we do not get access to the actual videos of your workout, but just to the dots marking your movements. These dots may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions. We will destroy these data as soon as the purpose of data collection is satisfied.
Your body composition information
. When you request a body composition report, we analyze the photos of your body that you choose to upload, including the information we get from the analysis, like your body position, orientation, topology, and other elements of the photo. We use this information only for the purpose of the body composition report and delete the photos and the information right after we generate the body composition report. Upon your explicit consent, however, we may store your photos and the information we get from the photos for up to one month and use them to improve our body composition function.
Details about your in-app purchases
. This may include, for example, details of the time you made certain purchases and your subscription details.
Cookies
. We use cookies on our website to operate and administer the Services and improve your experience there.
Analytics
. We may use analytics service providers that help us analyze how users interact with the Services to enhance your experience.
All the information above is your personal data, and we call it this way throughout the privacy policy.
‍

within one month.

We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your personal data.
Please understand that no security system is perfect and, as such, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the Services, or that your information won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us. In case your personal data got compromised due to a security breach, we will act promptly to identify the cause and take all reasonable steps to remedy the breach. We will inform you of the incident, if necessary, in connection with the applicable legislation. If you want to report a security incident related to our Services, please contact us at

7. Changes to our privacy policy
The date this privacy policy was last reviewed is indicated at the top of the page. We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when we add a new purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and freedoms (for example, by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing purposes of processing, a new legal basis, or a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users), we will ask for your consent to those changes separately from this privacy policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our Services provided to you if those Services inevitably include consent to the changes.

Effective as of May 09, 2022
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Zing Coach, Inc. (further will be referred as
“we”
or
“us”
) collects, stores, uses and protects your Personal Data in connection with usage of our website
https://zing.coach/
and our application Zing Coach™ (together referred to as the
“Services”
). This policy also explains your personal data protection rights, and we are happy to help you exercise them. We value your privacy and do our best to ensure its security.

Art. 6.1 (f) – we have a legitimate interest to process these data

You provide it to us
We use it to provide you with our Services
Art. 6.1 (a) – we receive your consent
All the above data are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as
“Personal Data”
.
2. How long we retain your Personal Data
We retain your Personal Data for as long as your account is active or for as long as it is necessary for the purposes of its collection and processing, unless we are required to retain your Personal Data for a longer period due to applicable legislation requirements, any ongoing dispute resolution or in order to enforce our agreements.
If you choose to delete the application, deactivate your account, we retain your Personal data for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
3. What are your data protection rights?
We want to make sure that you are fully aware of all your data protection rights and they ways you can exercise them. You are entitled to the following:
3.1 The right to access.
You can ask us for a confirmation that we process your Personal Data with the information related to its processing.
3.2 The right to data portability.
You can request that we provide you with your Personal Data in a structured and portable format. Apart from that, you can ask us to transmit those data to another controller directly, where technically feasible.
3.3 The right to correction.
You can ask us to correct your Personal Data if you believe that it might be inaccurate.
3.4 The right to erasure.
You may ask us to erase your Personal Data upon your withdrawal of the consent to processing if you believe that such processing is unlawful. You may also ask us to erase your Personal Data in some other cases indicated in art. 17.1 of the GDPR. Please note that erasure of your Personal Data may affect your use of our Services.
3.5 The right to restrict processing.
You can request a restriction of your Personal Data processing if you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data.
3.6 The right to object to processing.
You can object to the processing of your Personal Data that is processed under certain legal bases - for example, the data that we process under the legitimate interest basis.
3.7 The right to lodge a complaint
with your local data protection supervisor. You can do so in case you believe that our activities are not compliant with the applicable data protection regulations. However, if you have such concerns about our data protection activities, we would kindly ask you to first contact us at
support@zing.coach
and we will do our best to ensure proper handling of your Personal Data.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights 3.1 – 3.6 above, please contact us at
support@zing.coach
and describe your request in the plain language. If you make a request, we have
30 calendar days
to make respective actions in connection with your request. In case we need any more time to help you exercise any of your rights, we will let you know.
In case your request is vague or unclear, we may engage into a conversation with you in order to better understand your request. We may also refuse manifestly unfounded and excessive requests.
We can ask you to prove your identity while exercising your data protection rights. This is made to ensure that you are indeed entitled to receive certain information and that no rights of third parties are violated by your request.
4. Security measures
We take the protection of your Personal Data very seriously and take all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect them from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Among others, we utilize the following information security measures to protect your Personal Data:
a. Encryption of your Personal Data in transit and in rest;
b. Systematic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing;
c. Protection of data integrity;
d. Organizational and legal measures. For example, our employees have different levels of access to your Personal Data and only those in charge of data management get access to your Personal Data and only for limited purposes required for the operation of the application. We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your Personal Data.
Please understand that no security system is perfect and, as such, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the Services, or that your information won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us. In case your Personal Data got compromised due to a security breach, we will act promptly to identify the cause and take all reasonable steps to remedy the breach. We will inform you of the incident, if necessary, in connection with the applicable legislation.
If you want to report a security incident related to our Services, please contact us at
support@zing.coach
.
5. Children’s privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data of any person under the age of 13 (of 16 years old for the residents of the European Union). If you are aware of anyone under 13 (or 16 years old for the residents of the European Union) using the Services, please contact us at
support@zing.coach
and we will take required steps to delete such information and (or) delete the account.
6. Sharing of your Personal Data
We may use external service providers to process your Personal Data on our behalf. When we do so, we have appropriate agreements in place to protect such data. In the case of international transfers, we always make sure that additional safeguard mechanisms are in place (for example, by adding Standard Contractual Clauses).

In some cases, you will have to explicitly accept changes to Privacy Policy to continue using the App. We encourage you to periodically review our Website and the App for the latest information on our data privacy practices. If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, we ask that you do not use the App. Please exit the App immediately if you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We will not use the information gained through your use of the HealthKit and other frameworks for advertising or similar services, or sell it to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers.
We will not process Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you in accordance with Section 2 of this Privacy Policy or collect any Personal Data that is not required for the mentioned purposes. For any new purpose of processing we will ask your separate explicit consent. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We also undertake to collect only such amount and type of Personal Data that is strictly required for the purposes mentioned in this Section of the Privacy Policy («data minimization principle»).
3. Your rights
Modification, correction and erasure
You are able to modify, correct, erase, and update your Personal Data by writing us at

support@zing.coach
.

How to exercise your privacy rights
Contact us at
support@zing.coach
to exercise any of your privacy rights.
﻿
We will exercise them within 30 days after receipt. It may take us up to 90 days in some cases, for example for full erasure of your Personal Data stored in our backup systems. We will let you know if we need more time and explain the reasons for the delay.
What else?
Notice about automated decision-making
We may use automated decision-making tools (e.g. neural networks) that process your Personal Data in order to provide you proper Services (for example, suggesting new fasting protocols or providing insights). Normally, such automated decision-making works more precisely, if you insert more Personal Data about your meal/liquid intake details, fasting times, physical activities that our neural networks can work with. Our neural networks process this information in order to track particular dependencies and correlations in your eating patterns and provide you more personalized information about your lifestyle.
Notification requirements
We commit to notify you (within reasonable period of time) and your data protection authority (within the timeframe specified in applicable law) about any personal data breaches in the App.
Data Protection Authorities
Subject to applicable laws, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority about any of our activities (related to your privacy rights, among others) that you think are not compliant with applicable law. However, if you think that we do something incorrectly, let us know first at
support@zing.coach
. We care about your privacy and want to make sure that we did everything to address any of your concern.
Please keep in mind that in case of a vague access, erasure, objection request or any other request in exercise of the mentioned rights we may engage the individual in a dialogue so as to better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. We may also refuse manifestly unfounded and excessive (repetitive) requests.
﻿Subject to applicable laws, we might also require you to prove your identity (for example, by requesting an ID or any other proof of identity) in order for you to invoke the mentioned rights, specifically if you exercise them in respect to special categories of Personal Data like data about health. This is made to ensure that no rights of third parties are violated by your request, and the rights described in this section are exercised by an actual Personal Data subject or an authorized person.
﻿
Please note that we will grant your request within 30 days after receiving it, but it may take us up to 90 days in some cases, for example for full erasure of your Personal Data stored in our backup systems - this is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data.

Third parties processing your Personal Data
We will not share your Personal Data with any third parties except as specified below.
Processing to find new Zing Coach users and stay in touch with you

If we need to share your Personal Data with other platforms for this purpose, except as defined herein, we will ask for your consent. If this is required by law, we will secure your consent to share your non-health data with AppsFlyer and its integrated partners.

These integrated partners analyze your data and show relevant information about the App to people who might be potentially interested in it or remind you about revisiting the App, if you stopped using it a while ago.

6. Personal data you elect to share with third parties
You can direct us to share data from the App with other parties. For example, you can permit us to share data with other health apps and services like Apple HealthKit. Once you direct us to share your data with a third party, that third party will have their own privacy policy and we do not control how the third party uses or handles the information. You can revoke your consent to share information with such a third party at any time in your App account settings.
We take reasonable steps in order to ensure compliance of such third parties with any applicable laws that might govern processing of your Personal Data. For example, for the EU residents' Personal Data we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties are GDPR compliant and have GDPR compliant privacy policies in place.
7. Security
We take all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect all collected Personal Data from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data that we process and risks associated with special categories of Personal Data we collect (information about health).

a. Encryption of your Personal Data in transit and in rest;
b. Systematic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing;
c. Protection of data integrity;
d. Organizational and legal measures. For example, our employees have different levels of access to your Personal Data and only those in charge of data management get access to your Personal Data and only for limited purposes required for the operation of the App. We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your Personal Data.
e. Conducting periodical data protection impact assessments in order to ensure that the App fully adheres to the principles of "privacy by design", "privacy by default" and others. We also commit to undertake privacy audit in case of Company's merger or takeover.
Please understand that you can help keep your information secure by choosing and protecting your password appropriately, not sharing your password and preventing others from using your mobile device. Please understand that no security system is perfect and, as such, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App, or that your information won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may either post a notice, or attempt to notify you by email and will take reasonable steps to remedy the breach as specified in this Privacy Policy.
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
8. Children's privacy
General age limitation. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The App is not intended for children and we do not intentionally collect information about children under 16 years old. The App does not collect Personal Data from any person the Company actually knows is under the age of 16. If you are aware of anyone under 16 using the App, please contact us at

Opt-out options. You can always opt out of receiving emails by unsubscribing via the “Unsubscribe” link contained in the email.
