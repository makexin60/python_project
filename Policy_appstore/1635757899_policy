Privacy Policy
Last updated: August 15, 2024
We work hard to make our use of personal data transparent and to make your rights and choices easy to understand. Privacy laws have continued to evolve, and we have made changes to this policy due to new privacy laws in certain U.S. states. We also have information for our residents in the EEA and the UK about who is responsible for their personal data.
Who are we?
We are MEET JULI AB, but we usually just call ourselves JULI. You can always contact us in the following way:

Thank you for using JULI! Our mission is to give everyone the inspiration to create wishlists of the products they love.

Some of the terms below are a bit technical, but we have done our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.

How and why we use your information
To fulfill legal and statutory obligations:
Access to, storage, preservation, or sharing of information when we do so as a result of a court order, a search warrant, a production order, a lawsuit, or a similar legal request.
Access to, storage, preservation or sharing of information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal or statutory obligations, including sharing with law enforcement or other authorities.
To manage and resolve inquiries and complaints. We retain correspondence about inquiries from those registered under GDPR for two years, unless these inquiries are not resolved and this correspondence is needed to handle any complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is saved while the complaints are resolved.
Examples of laws that may require us to process information in the above manner are:
Regulations:
to fulfill statutory obligations, e.g., under privacy laws (GDPR).
Civil, commercial, criminal or consumer protection issues: when we have received a court order to disclose information in connection with court proceedings or official investigations (e.g., decisions or mandatory inquiries under the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, GDPR).
Business and tax matters:
obligations under the Irish Companies Act 2014 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.
Issues related to the security of our service and to protect rights, property, and users.
We retain information if it is necessary to investigate misuse of our Services, e.g., spam and other negative experiences. If we suspend an account because it violates our terms, we also retain information about that user for security, safety, and privacy reasons.
Use of information categories.
Any of the information categories listed in "We collect information in several different ways" except precise location information (which is not collected from users in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK).
Your rights and choices.
We offer you certain opportunities to decide on your data. Depending on where you live (e.g., EEA, Switzerland, UK, USA), these choices may also be privacy rights that you have under local law. To exercise these rights, you can visit your account settings and, if you still need help, our help center.
Access:
You can request access to the information we collect and hold about you, sometimes even in a portable format. You can find more information about this in our help center.
Correction:
You can correct your data by updating it in your profile.
Deletion:
You can have your data removed. In your settings, choose "Delete your data and your account" and follow the instructions.
Opt out of "targeted advertising", "sharing" or "selling": As described above, some of our activities may constitute "targeted advertising", "sharing" or "selling" as defined by these terms in some U.S. state privacy laws. You can opt-out of this at any time by following the instructions in the Privacy and Data Settings menu. Note that you will still see ads on our Services, but they will not be based on off-site data.
We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your rights or options in connection with your personal data. These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, if they would infringe on a third party's rights (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete information that we are legally required to retain or that we have a compelling legitimate interest in retaining. If we reject your request to exercise your rights, you may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us at marketing@juli-app.com.
You have choices regarding your information on JULI. If you have a JULI account, many of these controls are built into JULI or your settings. For example, you can: edit information in your profile, link or unlink your JULI account from other services (e.g., Facebook or Google), edit settings for private boards, and close your account at any time. We also support settings that limit ad tracking on iOS and ad customization on Android devices.
You may also have choices through the device or software you use to access JULI. For instance, the browser you use may offer you the ability to control
cookies
or other types of local data storage
Transfer of your information.
JULI is a global service. By using our products and services, you allow us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the USA, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the authorities' right to access your personal information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.
Additional steps for data transfer within the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take additional measures in connection with data transfers. Information controlled by MEET JULI AB will be transferred or sent to, or stored and processed in the USA or other countries outside your home country for the purposes described in this policy. Note that these data transfers are necessary to provide the services specified in our terms and to operate our global business.
Since JULI is a global service, we may transfer personal data for people residing in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK to a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK. If we transfer information from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK to a country that does not offer an adequate level of protection, we will only do so with appropriate safeguards to protect your information.
The safeguards that we rely on to ensure that your information receives an adequate level of protection include, among others:
Decisions on Adequate Level of Protection:
This refers to decisions made by the European Commission in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) confirming that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in "How we use the information we collect" to certain countries that have made such decisions about an adequate level of protection, such as the countries listed here.
Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”):
The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that enable companies within the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalents in the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in "How we use the information we collect" to certain entities within our corporate group and third parties in countries that have not received a decision on adequate protection level.
Transfers to countries that do not have a decision on an adequate level of protection usually take place based on standard contractual clauses. However, under certain circumstances, transfers can also be made based on the exceptions provided in data protection legislation. For instance, this might include sharing with law enforcement agencies in emergencies where we learn that a person's life is in danger.
We also identify and use additional protections suitable for each data transfer. For example, we use technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymization, as well as policies and processes to contest disproportionate or illegal government requests. To get a copy of these decisions on an adequate level of protection or SCCs, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section below.
How long we keep your information:
We only retain your information if we need it to provide [JULI] to you and to fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no reason for us to keep it to comply with our legal or statutory obligations, we either delete it from our systems or depersonalize it so we can't use it to identify you.
For those residing in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, here's additional information on our data storage practices: We only keep your data as long as necessary for the purposes stated in this privacy policy, which includes providing our service, or for other legitimate purposes like complying with legal obligations, enforcing penalties, preventing violations of our terms, combating spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. Storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. We retain account information, such as your name, phone number, email address, and password, if your account exists because we need them to manage your account.
‍
User content:
JULI allows you to post content, including photos, videos, comments, links, and other materials. For the purpose of these Terms, anything that you post or otherwise make available on JULI is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to JULI. All User Content must comply with these Terms and our policies.
You will only post User Content that you have the rights to post, and you won’t post User Content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement or counterfeit), or that is otherwise unlawful, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law. We can take action against User Content that violates these Terms or our policies or where we are permitted or required by law, such as by removing, restricting, or limiting access to, or distribution of, the content.
We can also suspend or terminate accounts of users who repeatedly or seriously infringe third-party intellectual property rights, violate the law, these Terms, or our policies, or where permitted or required to do so by law. We are a neutral intermediary and we do not review all User Content before or after it is published on the Service, so we are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other JULI user. For more information about how we enforce our policies or otherwise take action on content on JULI. Where appropriate, you may appeal the decisions you think were made in error. You may have a right under local law to bring a claim for breach of contract if you believe we have breached these Terms by removing, restricting or limiting access to, or distribution of, your User Content, or suspending or terminating your account. JULI cannot provide you with legal advice.
‍
Your rights and choices:
We offer you some choices about your data. Depending on where you live (e.g., EEA, Switzerland, UK, USA), these choices might also be privacy rights you have under local legislation.
Access:
You can request access to the information we collect and hold about you, sometimes even in a portable format.
Correction:
You can correct your information by updating it in your profile.
Deletion:
You can have your information deleted. In your settings, choose "Delete Account" and follow the instructions.
Opt out of "targeted advertising," "sharing," or "selling": As described above, some of our activities may be classified as "targeted advertising," "sharing," or "selling" according to the definition of these terms in certain state privacy laws in the USA. You can opt out at any time by following the instructions in the Privacy and Data Settings menu. Note that you'll still see ads on our Services, but they won't be based on off-site data.
