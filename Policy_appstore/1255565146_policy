What information do we collect?
We have access to information coming from Google Developer Console, Facebook Analytics (Blocky Farm Racing & Simulator only) and Firebase Analytics. For games deployed on iOS platform we have access to data from iTunes Connect dashboard. For games on Amazon App Store – access to data from Amazon dashboard. These information are presented anonymously e.g. number of downloads divided by countries, name of devices and their OS versions etc.). We are not able to match these information with specific person or device.
Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA") on Apple and Google Advertising Identity ("GAID"). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple you can opt-out this by choosing "limit ad tracking" option from privacy settings. On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing "Opt-out of interest based ads". Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device. Additionally user can opt-out from personalized ads and analytics service in game privacy policy menu.
