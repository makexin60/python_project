Under the GDPR, you need to have a legal ​justification (called a “lawful basis” in the regulation) to use an individual’s personal data. We list these in each section and use the term “lawful basis.”
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
This section outlines why we collect information and what we do with it. The next section outlines what information we collect. We use the information we collect for the following purposes.
Provide And Maintain The Products and The Services.
Using the account, payment, and usage information we collect, we can deliver the Products and Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your HeartMath dashboard tracking your heart rate variability, journal, and other trends, and to give you customer support. We use your postal address to ship our Products to you. The lawful basis of processing this information is to perform our contract with you. Regarding device information constituting health information, the lawful basis of processing this information is consent.
Improve, Personalize, And Develop the Services
We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors, perform data analysis and testing, conduct research and surveys, and develop new features and Services. When you allow us to collect geolocation information, we use that information to provide your general location on a map of current Global Coherence App users. We may use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content. The lawful bases of processing this information are our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving our Services, providing content relevant to our users, and develop new Services and performing our contract with you to facilitate providing the Products and Services in an effective and efficient manner. We only use this information anonymously. When data is anonymized and aggregated, we do not ask explicit permission.
Communicate With Us
We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Services notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email. The lawful basis of processing this information is our legitimate interests in responding to your communications and to grow our business.
If you post information using our forums, leaderboards, social media accounts, and other special tools, such as to post a review on the HeartMath website, our Service will display the information in accordance with your instructions. By posting such information, you consent to the display of that information. The lawful basis of processing this information is consent.
Promote Safety and Security.
We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services for our users and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. We may also use collected information to investigate violations consistent with applicable laws, regulations, or other governmental authority. The lawful basis of processing this information is our legitimate interests to maintain HeartMath’s and our users’ safety and security.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
This section outlines what information we collect.
When you purchase our Products or use our Services, we collect the following types of personal information:
Personal Information You Provide Us

You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and username.
Additional Information.
To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, for example biographical information or a profile photo.

If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval, sends back to your device a token. The token is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing sensitive card information to us. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and card issuer’s name and contact information. You can delete or change payment information via the payment settings in your account on our website. Deleting your account will also delete stored payment information. We do not store your transaction history.

To achieve this, we conduct ongoing, peer-reviewed, and published research using anonymized customer practice data, including heart rate variability, practice duration, and frequency. “Anonymized” means that all personal identifiers are removed, so the data cannot be traced back to you.

Your participation helps us make meaningful strides in this important field.

OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN
We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.
HeartMath allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select HeartMath programs (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, which information we collect form a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.
Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at
privacy@heartmath.com.
In the instance that the software is being used within a school district, it is incumbent on the school district HeartMath’s to comply with applicable law and is ascertaining parental consent prior to using the software with children under 13.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We work hard to keep your personal information safe. We have a written information security plan to implement and maintain a combination of industry-standard technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your personal information. No method of transmitting or storing information is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Service.
OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS
We have alliance partners outside the US and they transfer personal information from their countries, including those in the European Union and the UK, to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.
We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world. These include your consent and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.
Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. You agree to this risk when you create a HeartMath account and click “I agree” to data transfers, irrespective of which country you live in. If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your HeartMath account as described in the Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data section.
HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Please review Section “Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data” for how your account settings and tools allow you to exercise your rights under the GDPR and this policy to access and control your personal data.
In addition to the various controls that we offer, in certain circumstances, you can seek to restrict our processing of your data, or object to our processing of your data based on our legitimate interests, including as described in Section 2 (How We Use Information). Under the GDPR, you have a general right to object to the use of your information for direct marketing purposes. Please see your notification settings on our subscriptions page at:

This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval, sends back to your device a token. The token is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing sensitive card information to us. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and card issuer’s name and contact information. You can delete or change payment information via the payment settings in your account on our website. Deleting your account will also delete stored payment information. We do not store your transaction history.
If you purchase HeartMath technology on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CCV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order and store a record of your purchase for financial purposes. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.

Your participation helps us make meaningful strides in this important field.

OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN
We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy.
HeartMath allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select HeartMath programs (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, which information we collect form a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account.
Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at
privacy@heartmath.com.
In the instance that the software is being used within a school district, it is incumbent on the school district HeartMath’s to comply with applicable law and is ascertaining parental consent prior to using the software with children under 13.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We work hard to keep your personal information safe. We have a written information security plan to implement and maintain a combination of industry-standard technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your personal information. No method of transmitting or storing information is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Service.
OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS
We have alliance partners outside the US and they transfer personal information from their countries, including those in the European Union and the UK, to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.
We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world. These include your consent and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.
Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. You agree to this risk when you create a HeartMath account and click “I agree” to data transfers, irrespective of which country you live in. If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your HeartMath account as described in the Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data section.
HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
