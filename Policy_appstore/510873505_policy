Fees and Purchase Terms.
6.1 General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not Software.
The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the Services. All fees set forth within and paid by you under the Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this purpose. In no way are these fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of Keepsafe’s Software or Application, and, furthermore, any use of Keepsafe’s Software or Application by you in furtherance of the Terms will be considered merely in support of the purpose of the Terms.
6.2 Payment.
You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Keepsafe collects payments through a limited number of payment services (“
Payment Provider
”). You must provide Keepsafe with valid account information for the respective chosen Payment Provider. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or other payment method, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing Keepsafe with your payment information, you agree that Keepsafe is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to Keepsafe hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Keepsafe of any change in payment credentials for payment hereunder. Keepsafe reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Website or by e-mail delivery to you.
6.3 Service Subscription Fees.
You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a “
Service Subscription Fee
”) at the time you create your Account and select the term of your subscription (each, a “
Service Commencement Dat
”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and Keepsafe for the Services until Keepsafe or the Payment Provider, for example Apple or Google, accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication.
6.4 Taxes.
Keepsafe’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Service, or payments for any Service, are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Keepsafe, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and you will indemnify Keepsafe for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “
Sales Tax
” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Keepsafe its permitted to pass to its customers that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
6.5 Automatic Renewal.
Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms.
After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Keepsafe’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the “Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App Store or the “My Apps” page in the Google Play Store app. The same page will permit you to change your Account settings if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription.
If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Keepsafe to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Keepsafe does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Keepsafe may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).
6.6 Pre-purchased Minutes and Texts.
Users of the Telephony Service may be able to purchase calling minutes and text messaging packages (collectively, “
Pre-Purchased Packages
“). Pre-Purchased Packages are not legal tender and cannot be reloaded, resold, transferred for value, redeemed for cash or applied to any other account, except to the extent described herein or as required by applicable law. Keepsafe prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Pre-Purchased Packages outside of the Telephony Services, or the purported sale, lease, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears or originates outside of the Telephony Services. Accordingly, you may not trade, sell or attempt to sell Pre-Purchased Packages for “real” money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside the Telephony Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your Account to termination. You shall ensure that you have sufficient Pre-Purchased Packages in your Account before you initiate any transaction that requires such credits. If you have insufficient Telephony Credits in your Account to complete the transaction, the transaction will be cancelled. ALL TRANSACTIONS MADE USING Pre-Purchased Packages ARE FINAL AND ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
Keepsafe Is Provided As-Is.
KEEPSAFE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR CONTENT WILL BE SAFE FROM OUTSIDE ATTACKS, HACKERS OR OTHER WAYS OF ACCESSING YOUR CONTENT ON THE FILE SYSTEMS. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE KEEPSAFE PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE KEEPSAFE PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS. KEEPSAFE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Limitation of Liability.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL KEEPSAFE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY KEEPSAFE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT YOU CLAIM. IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID KEEPSAFE ANY AMOUNTS DURING SUCH PERIOD, KEEPSAFE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).

Miscellaneous Legal Terms.
10.1 Electronic Communications
The communications between you and Keepsafe use electronic means, whether you visit the Website or send Keepsafe e-mails, or whether Keepsafe posts notices on the Website or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) agree to receive communications from Keepsafe in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Keepsafe provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.
10.2 Release
You hereby release Keepsafe and its successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the Terms or your use of the Website, the Application, the Software or the Service. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
10.3 Assignment
The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Keepsafe’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
10.4 Force Majeure
Keepsafe and its licensors shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God; war; terrorism; riots; embargos; acts of civil or military authorities; fire; floods; accidents; strikes or shortages of transportation facilities; fuel; energy; labor; materials; problems with your computing or network infrastructure, hardware or product; problems with your internet service provider (ISP) or any sites you are attempting access through the VPN Service; or any electrical or other utility outage.
10.5 Dispute Resolution
(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Keepsafe may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of the Keepsafe Properties.
(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“
AAA
”). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “
Rules and Procedures
”).
(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
(d) You and Keepsafe must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR KEEPSAFE MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Keepsafe will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (iv) Keepsafe also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.
(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 8 of the Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States federal law.Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Keepsafe may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Keepsafe shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in San Francisco County, California. By using the Keepsafe Properties in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision.

In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Keepsafe is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Terms, Keepsafe’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Keepsafe at the following address: 427 Bryant St., San Francisco, CA 94107. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Keepsafe by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
10.9 Severability.
If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
