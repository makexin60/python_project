Purchasing our products or services
We need to process your personal data in order to provide you with the products and services you purchase from us. If you have already registered an account, then we will use the information you provided during the registration process to deliver and communicate with you about your purchase. In addition to this, we will need to collect your payment card details in order to process payment
The legal basis we rely on to process this data is article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party.
Depending on the service or product you have purchased, we may also need to collect additional information such as:
details of any disability or access requirement when you purchase a ticket for an event or service which will take place at the stadium or any of our other locations. This enables us to make reasonable adjustments to make your visit safe and comfortable and compliant with the Equality Act 2010. The legal bases we rely on for this are article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR which allows us to process information to meet a legal obligation and article 9(2)(b) as the processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out our obligations in the field of social security and social protection law.
details about any medical conditions you may have when you enrol in one of our coaching courses. We have a duty of care for all participants that enrol in our coaching courses. Processing this information enables us to administer appropriate first aid in the event that participants are injured or taken ill whilst on our premises. The legal bases we rely on are article 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) which require us to obtain your explicit consent.
details about your vehicle where the product or service you have purchased entitles you to a parking space.

We may also send you notifications based on this data where you have consented to in-app push notifications (see ‘Push Notifications’ below to enhance your match-day experience).

Fraud screening and prevention
Sometimes where there is suspicion of illegal activity such as fraud or ticket touting, we will ask you to provide a copy of an identity document such as a passport. This is usually only necessary for overseas customers and some UK customers where the value of the purchase exceeds a threshold or where the delivery address is different to the card address.
In addition, we may keep the personal information of individuals suspected of suspicious purchasing and touting activity. This information may be shared with other clubs and local law enforcement agencies as we attempt to protect the public against seriously improper conduct.
We also requested copies of identity documents for ticket holder name changes i.e. maiden to marital surname, to verify the name change and ultimately to prevent tickets being reallocated to different people.
When we have completed the check process, we delete the copies.
The legal basis we rely on to process this data is article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data for our legitimate interests. In this case our legitimate interests are protecting us and our customers against fraud.

The App will ask you for permission to access your device’s location data. It may also ask you to provide your country of residence. You are under no obligation to provide this information and you can choose to provide neither.
If you do give your permission, the App will collect your location data on match days. We use this data to help us understand the travel patterns of our supporters with a view to ensuring that the travel facilities we put in place on match days are adequate. Where you also permit push notifications (see Push Notifications), we will use your location data to provide you with any relevant updates.
Push notifications
The App will ask you to permit push notifications so we can notify you of things we believe you would want to know.

We do this to provide you with in-App directions to Stadium facilities and to notify you of any relevant promotions or offers in your immediate vicinity.
Taking photos using the App
It is possible to take photos from within the App however the App will need to access your device’s camera in order to do this. When you use this function, the App will ask for your permission to access your device’s camera.
Publishing your photos to the “photo wall” or sharing on social media

You can also share photos to your social media profiles from within the App where they will be visible to your social media contacts.
Our App will remind you of this at the time you upload your photos and we will take your submission of the photo as your consent for it to be displayed on the “photo wall” or posted to your social media profile.
Quiz leader boards
When you take part in quizzes within the App, we may display your first name and the initial of your last name on quiz leader boards. This will only happen if you are logged into the App.
You can change your permissions at any time by using the permissions part of the App.

We retain these two pieces of information for the duration of a season. At the end of each season we delete all such data from the wifi system.
We also operate a web filtering system which blocks access to indecent or malicious websites that could pose a security threat to our wifi network.

Automated Decision-making and profiling
Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without human review.
The only time we conduct any form of automated-decision making based on profiling is when you visit our websites. We use third party software to analyse the way you use our websites in order to provide you with a more personalised experience next time you visit our websites. For example, we may analyse the products you buy from our shop or the types of web pages you look at the most. Next time you visit our website we will then tailor the content we provide you based on those preferences. We might also suggest other products or services you might be interested in.
These activities are fully automated and you can turn them off by disabling our website’s cookies in your web browser. Our
Cookie Policy
explains how to do this.
We do not conduct any other forms of automated-decision making particularly anything that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you. If this changes over time, we will seek your explicit consent and update this privacy notice accordingly.
Sharing your information
Tottenham Hotspur shares your personal data internally and with selected third-parties in the following circumstances:
Third party service providers.
In order to provide our products and services to you or to otherwise fulfil contractual arrangements that we have with you, we may need to appoint data processors to carry out some of the data processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, payment processing organisations, delivery organisations, fraud prevention and screening and credit risk management companies, mailing houses and IT system providers. We have contracts in place with our data processors which means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them. They will not share your personal information with any other organisations and will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.
Back to Top
Commercial Partners
We may also share personal data, such as your name and contact details, with our commercial partners but only where you have explicitly consented to this or requested that we do so. For example, when you enter a competition which is a joint promotion, or you request to receive certain marketing communications. In any case, we will provide you with clear information before we share your personal data.
Other football clubs
Some European countries require their football clubs to keep full records of all away fans attending their matches. Consequently, when you purchase an away match ticket for a European game, we may be required to disclose your personal information to the hosting club. As this activity forms part of us providing you with the product or service you have purchased, the legal basis we rely on to process this data is article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. You can object to us sharing your data with other clubs however it we will not be able to guarantee your entry at the match.
Publicity and media
We may disclose your personal data publicly via the media or social media. For example, when sharing a comment or opinion you have provided or if you win a competition or promotion we may disclose your name online. In such cases, we will clearly notify you of the sharing and you will have the choice not to participate or to otherwise object to such sharing, subject to our other legal obligations.
Supporters’ Clubs
Tottenham Hotspur has a network of Supporters’ Clubs around the globe. We may share personal data, such as your name and contact details, with the representatives of your nearest Supporters’ Club but only where you have explicitly consented to this or requested that we do so.
Legal and other
We may also share your data with third parties:
if we are under a legal or regulatory duty to do so
if it is necessary to do so to enforce our terms and conditions of sale or other contractual rights
to lawfully assist the police or security services with the prevention and detection of crime or terrorist activity
where such disclosure is necessary to protect the safety or security of any persons
and/or (e) otherwise as permitted under applicable law.
International data transfers
We are based in the UK but sometimes your personal information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, some of our third-party suppliers or commercial partners to which we disclose your personal data may be situated outside of the EEA. Where we do transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, we make sure that we put one of the EU’s approved suitable safeguards in place, for example using approved contractual agreements or by obtaining your explicit consent for the transfer.
Security
Protecting your personal information is very important to us and as such we have put a range of security defences in place in order to ensure it.
This includes:
Technical measures such as encryption when we send your data over the internet, anti-virus software, secure user accounts on our systems that restrict access to your personal information, regular data back-ups, and conducting security testing of our systems.
Physical security measures that ensure that physical access to your data, whether it is in electronic or hard copy form, is also restricted and controlled.
Personnel security measures such as contractual clauses in employment contracts that require our employees to protect the confidentiality of your data, and regular awareness training about data protection and information security.
Some of our IT systems are provided by third party suppliers. In these cases the security of your data is a shared responsibility and we have contracts in place which outline each party’s responsibilities for the security of data.
Keeping your information
We retain your personal information for the minimum reasonable time period to allow us to fulfil the purposes that we collected it for. We will delete or destroy your data after that time except where we need to keep any personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve ongoing disputes or defend ourselves against future legal claims, or enforce our agreements.
Occasionally, we may continue to use data without further notice to you. This will only be the case where any such data is anonymised and you cannot be identified as being associated with that data.

If the new purpose is not compatible with the original purpose, we will ask for your specific consent for the new purpose. If the law changes so that we must process your data for a new purpose, we will inform you before making the change.
At the point when we collect your personal data, we will always remind you of why we need it and how we plan to use it.
Automated decision-making and profiling
We do not conduct any automated decision-making such as profiling. If this changes, we will update this privacy notice and update you accordingly.
Sharing your information with third parties
We may share your personal information with third parties as part of our service to you. The list below shows who we may share information with and the situations where we might do so.
Service providers
: In order to provide our services effectively we may need to appoint data processors to carry out some of the data processing on our behalf. These include, for example, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, who provide us with our IT service, and other software suppliers. We have agreements in place with our data processors which means they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we instruct them to do so.
Funding partners
: We may share your personal data with the organisations we work in partnership to deliver our community activities. These include schools, local authorities and charities who are all also registered data controllers. We have agreements in place with them to acknowledge that we are both responsible for preserving your privacy and processing your data in accordance with the law. The data may or may not be shared anonymously, but we will let you know which is the case when you register.
Publicity and Media
: From time to time we may wish to publicise the work we are doing through publications or the media, including social media. We may ask you to be a part of this but we will only disclose your personal information, such as your photograph, with your explicit consent, or that of your guardian if you are under 16.
Tottenham Hotspur Football Club

Legal and other obligations:
We may also share your personal data with third parties in the following circumstances:
If we are under a legal or regulatory requirement to do so
To lawfully assist the police or security services with the prevention and detection of crime or terrorist activity
Where disclosure is necessary to protect the safety or security of any persons
International Data Transfers
We do not currently transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and put in place measures to ensure your information is given the appropriate level of protection.
Keeping your information

If you apply for a job and are successful
, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personnel file and retained during your employment and for 7 years afterwards as required by law.
If you apply for a job and are unsuccessful
, we will retain your personal details for a period of 6 months after your application. If you give us your explicit consent, we may hold your data on file for a further 6 months for consideration for future employment opportunities.
