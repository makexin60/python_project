Children’s Privacy
Car Parking, Racing And Stunt Games provides advertising services for a range of apps, some of which are primarily targeted at children and their families, and others are intended for users of all ages. Apps targeting both children and older audiences must implement a neutral age screen that does not result in data collection from children.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined and required by applicable laws. On any application where we ask for age and determine whether the user is under 13 years of age or above, Yodo1 advertising services only forward ad requests to third-party Google Play certified ad networks to display ads while avoiding transmitting AAID if the user’s age is under 13 years of age.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
We do not collect or otherwise process personal data from individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland whom we know to be under the applicable age stated in the different implementations of the GDPR, except to comply with the law
or to support our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our app developers partners as described above.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):
We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
