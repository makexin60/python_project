SAFETY
While online dating can be a very rewarding and positive experience
,
it is vital that you take a cautious approach and protect your safety not only online
,
but offline. The following safety recommendations are intended as a guide only.
Online Safety
The Number One Rule:
Trust your instincts! Your gut feeling is usually right. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable or you feel like they have ill intentions
,
end the conversation. Exercise your right to block and/or report any users who you feel are misusing the website/app.
Don
’
t Give Away Too Much Information:
When first engaging with someone stay away from providing personal information
,
stick to a first name basis
,
do not give out your address or phone number. Do not give out social media accounts such as Facebook or Instagram. It
’
s also a good idea to create an alternative email address to use specifically for online dating accounts. Online dating can lead you to amazing connections with genuine people
,
but you need to protect yourself from things like money scams and identity theft.
Photos:
We suggest taking new and separate photos for your online dating accounts. While your profile will never appear in search engines such as Google
,
Yahoo
,
nor will it be accessible by the public
,
if you are using pictures from your social media accounts
,
a user may be able to search your image online. This could result in the user gaining more access to your personal life than you might like. Do not put revealing subject matter in your photos
,
such as your home or office buildings in the background. We also strongly urge you to not include children or anyone underage in your photos
,
as it goes against our code of conduct. Remember you are interacting with strangers
,
until you know their intentions
,
protect yourself and those you care for.
Look For the Signals:
Like anything internet based
,
there will always be a chance to run into scammers. We have dedicated teams working around the clock to stop these accounts
,
however with things like fake IP addresses
,
they can be hard to detect. The following are the most commonly used scamming signals we run into.
Distance:
Pay attention to your matches location. Try to stay local
,
unless otherwise needed. The farther away someone is from you
,
the easier it is for them not to get caught in a scam.
Too Good To be True:
There is a difference between someone having attractive pictures
,
and pictures that are posed and seem too good to be true. If you have doubts about someone being who they say they are in their pictures
,
try using services like Googles
‘
reverse image search
’
. Many scammers use the same picture on multiple sites. In the contrary
,
if someone has no photo posted and tells you they can
’
t post photos on the site
,
but can send them via email or text
,
do not offer to text them. Users can upload photos and keep them private until they wish to share them with someone
,
there is no reason to take the conversation elsewhere for this reason.
Contact Information:
A lot of potential scammers will send you long messages containing an email address
,
username
,
or a phone number
,
asking you to contact them outside of the app. Often once you have made contact they will ask you for money
,
or more commonly iTunes gift cards. Some scammers will agree to meet with you and then come up with a reason why they can
’
t make it due to a money issue
,
like babysitting money or transportation. Never in any circumstance give out your financial information. Financially providing for someone is not part of getting to know someone and not your responsibility.
Inconsistencies:
Look for inconsistency within your conversation
;
the most common being odd language
,
misspelling
,
or consistent typos. Location is another big thing to look for. Someone who
’
s profile is set to your area
,
but when it comes down to meeting claims to be on
“
vacation
”
or staying elsewhere.  Other inconsistencies may include interests
,
employment and marital status
,
or overall indirect answers to questions.
Offline Safety
Taking The Next Step:
Phone calling/Text messaging-
You can learn a lot about someone through messaging or texting
,
but we suggest engaging in real phone conversations before you meet with someone. Hearing a person
’
s voice for the first time will help you figure out your initial gut feelings. Enjoy some back and forth banter to really find out what you have in common. Get to know the person
,
including their full name and what they do for a living
,
are there any red flags? Are they making inappropriate comments? Never agree to meet up with someone who makes you feel uncomfortable.
Use The Internet To Your Advantage:
Once you find out a bit of information about your match
,
feel free to google them. Check for social media accounts such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Find out if you have any mutual friends that can reveal more about their character. Double check any information they told you that didn
’
t seem to add up.
Plan a date:
You have decided to meet up with your potential match
,
let
’
s plan the date. Make sure that whatever your mutual intentions are
,
that at least your first meet up is in public
,
familiar place. Also stick to one place
,
this keeps you safe and leaves the adventure to continue to the second date. Know your drink maximum and stick with it
,
don
’
t leave room for your decision making to be compromised. Do not leave your food or drinks unattended. Make sure your intentions and boundaries for the date are made clear. Always drive yourself
,
or find your own way to and from your first date. Once you have your date all planned out
,
tell a friend. Make sure you send a reliable friend the details of where you will be going
,
the date and time
,
and your dates name and contact details. It
’
s always a great idea to have someone to check in with after the date.
Trust Your Instincts:
Always listen to your intuition
,
it
’
s usually right! If you feel like your date is making your feel uncomfortable at any stage in the date
,
do not be afraid to remove yourself from the situation. This is another reason to keep a friend on hand
,
if you feel like things are going south
,
text a friend to come and meet you. Using good judgement and being cautious will often lead you to the best connections!
Have Fun:
Letting your guard down is usually the biggest risk with dating. In one way or another you have to take risks when it comes to finding love
,
or even new friends
,
just make sure that you never put yourself in physical danger. Once you have followed all the offline safety steps and you are comfortable with your date
,
there
’
s only one thing left to do
;
have fun and enjoy the process of getting to know someone new!

we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Sally. For further details

Privacy Policy
English
Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at

To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at

Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review.

Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.

Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers

Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.

Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.

Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
child’s educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
“cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.
