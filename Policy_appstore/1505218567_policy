Privacy Policy
This is the privacy policy for this website, the GizmoPack service, and the GizmoPack app. Privacy is very important to me, and I try to limit the third-party services I use.
Information collection
I don't use any third-party analytics services on this site or in the app, the only data I see are those reported to me by Apple when you use the app. Data stored with the 'Universal Variables' action are stored server-side to provide access to it through the Shortcut Action. Data stored in the 'Public' and 'Protected' Universal Variables database can also be served via a publicly-available HTTP API. The data stored by me is only used for providing the GizmoPack app and not used for any analytics.
Data Processors
I make use of the following third-party services:
Cloudflare
hosts this website and the background API I use for some actions.
Data stored in the 'Universal Variables' action are stored in Apple's CloudKit. Data stored in the 'Public' or 'Protected' database are available by anyone including me. Data stored in 'Private' is encrypted and only accessible by you.
If you sign up for the Testflight with your email, then that email is sent to Apple. I need your email so I can reply to you if you submit a bug report, I won't email you about anything else.
