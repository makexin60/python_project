(2) Only the following General Terms and Conditions apply between YAZIO GmbH (hereinafter, also the “Provider” or “YAZIO”) and the user of YAZIO services (hereinafter, the “User”) as amended at the time of use. Deviating terms and conditions of the User shall not be recognized, unless the Provider expressly agrees to their validity.
§ 2 Definition of terms

(2) The terms “Consumer” and “Entrepreneur” correspond to the legal definitions in Sections 13 and 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB). Thus, the User is herein the “Consumer,” insofar as the use or purchase of the YAZIO App cannot be assigned primarily to the User’s commercial or self-employed professional activity. In contrast, “Entrepreneur” refers to any natural or legal person or partnership with legal capacity that acts in exercise of its trade, business, or profession when using the YAZIO App or entering into the contract.
(3) “Distribution Platform” refers to the shops (stores) of platform operators, such as Google (“Google Play”) and Apple (“App Store”), where the User can select and download the YAZIO App to be installed on the User’s device.
§ 3 Use of the YAZIO Services
(1) The YAZIO Services can be used free of charge or for a fee. This also applies, in particular, to use of the Services via the YAZIO App. The App is always free of charge when installed through a Distribution Platform. Use for a fee always requires special, express consent by the User in the App (see below § 5 and § 6).
(2) As a general rule, the YAZIO App can be installed and operated on all YAZIO-supported platforms and end devices, including mobile phones, smartwatches, tablets, and other mobile devices.
(3) By using the Website or installing the App, the User accepts these General Terms and Conditions. If the User downloaded the App from a third-party Distribution Platform and accesses YAZIO Services through the App, then the respective terms and conditions of business and/or use of the Distribution Platform apply in addition. Where conflicts arise as a result of this, these General Terms and Conditions take precedence.
(4) The User confirms that his or her information is true, accurate, current, and complete. Regular updates of personal information are required.
(5) The User is not permitted to circumvent technologies used to control geographic or other access in order to use fee-based services of YAZIO without authorization.

Should YAZIO learn that personal data of a minor younger than the minimum age was collected without parental consent, the Provider will take the necessary steps to delete these data without delay.
§ 4 Health notice for YAZIO Services
(1) The Provider is not a medical organization, and its recommendations do not constitute medical advice. Due to possible unintended weight loss associated with the use of the YAZIO Services, the User is advised to consult a doctor in individual cases before using the YAZIO Services to discuss individual recommendations made by the Provider. This especially applies to users who are already receiving medical treatment or are taking prescription medication to treat a clinically diagnosed condition. The Provider recommends using the YAZIO Services under a doctor’s supervision and that regular medical check-ups be performed. The Provider accepts no responsibility for the actions of the User. None of the content is intended to supplement or replace information provided by a doctor or pharmacist. By agreeing to these General Terms and Conditions, the User confirms that he or she is solely responsible for his or her health.
(2) The Provider recommends that the User maintains his or her weight in accordance with the guidelines for healthy weight specified by the World Health Organization (WHO), which corresponds to a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 25. The BMI can be calculated using the following formula: body weight (in kg) divided by height (in m) squared.
§ 5 Setting up a user account
(1) The YAZIO App can be operated with or without a personalized user account. If a personalized user account is created, the User is required to enter his or her e-mail address and choose a password. The User can convert his or her existing anonymous account into a personal user account at any time by linking his or her e-mail address with the user account.
(2) To use the YAZIO App with the Apple Watch, the only requirement is the creation of a user account via “Sign in with Apple,” even if the Apple Watch is not paired with the User’s iPhone.
(3) The YAZIO App can also be used by linking it with the User’s profile at platform operator, e.g. by creating a YAZIO user account via “Sign in with Google”.
§ 6 Term and cancellation of free Services
If YAZIO Services are used free of charge, the contract of use may be canceled by either YAZIO or the User with 14 days’ notice sent to help@yazio.com or the User’s e-mail address on file, respectively. In addition, the User has the ability to delete the account in the App settings.
§ 7 Term, term renewal and cancellation of fee-based Services
(1) YAZIO offers Users subscriptions with various fixed terms and a usage fee specific for each term, which is payable in advance in order to be able to use all Services without limitation (hereinafter, also “YAZIO PRO” or “PRO Functions”).
(2) If the User wishes to use the functionality of the paid version of the YAZIO App, the User can purchase the PRO functions via the YAZIO Website as well as upgrade the app using an “in-app purchase” via a Distribution Platform.
(a) To purchase the PRO functions via the Provider’s Website, the User must log in with his or her e-mail address and password or reregister. In his or her user account, the User can view and purchase different subscription options on the corresponding product page.
(b) If the User carries out the upgrade via a Distribution Platform, the specific procedure shall be governed by the respective platform operator. The purchase agreement shall take place according to the terms and conditions of the respective Distribution Platform. These terms and conditions also determine whether the purchase agreement is to be made between the User and the Distribution Platform or between the User and the Provider.
(3) Where the subscription is purchased on the Website or through a Distribution Platform, e.g. the Google Play Store or the App Store, YAZIO may temporarily offer Users the option to use the chosen subscription free of charge for a YAZIO-specified period of time (trial subscription). The trial subscription begins on the date on which the purchase process is concluded. The User will be notified of the testing phase when signing up for the trial subscription. A fee will not be charged during the testing phase, but YAZIO may require the User to provide his or her payment details at the start of the trial subscription. If the User does not cancel the trial subscription during the period of the testing phase specified by YAZIO, the trial subscription automatically converts to a fee-based, limited-time subscription. The User will be notified of this and must provide his or her consent. The User will automatically be charged the relevant usage fee for the subscription after the last day of the YAZIO-specified testing phase. The PRO Functions will be automatically activated for the User after the purchase is completed. YAZIO may at any time change the scope of the Services for the trial subscription or discontinue offering a trial subscription.
(4) The limited-time subscription runs for at least the term originally chosen by the User, plus any preceding trial subscription period specified by YAZIO.
(5) The User may cancel the subscription at any time, effective at the end of the chosen term. If it is not canceled, the subscription renews for an unlimited period of time at the purchase conditions of the initial subscription and may be canceled by YAZIO or the User at any time with one month’s notice, effective at the end of the month. If the User paid in advance, differential amounts will be refunded.
(6) If the subscription was purchased at yazio.com, notice of cancellation is to be sent using the cancellation button found in the footer, in the App or by e-mail to help@yazio.com. If the Provider cancels, the User is to be canceled using the e-mail address on file. If the subscription was purchased through a Distribution Platform, it can be canceled in the manner described in the respective app store under subscription management.
(7) The right to cancel without notice for cause remains unaffected. Cause for YAZIO exists, in particular, where the User violates applicable law or material contractual duties. In addition, the arrangements in § 10 remain unaffected.
(8) If the User dies, his or her heirs are entitled to cancel the subscription in accordance with subsections 5 to 7.
§ 8 Payment of the usage fee
(1) After purchasing the YAZIO PRO functions via the YAZIO Website, the User will receive an invoice for the outstanding usage fee, unless another method of payment has been agreed upon. If the User opts for a limited-time subscription with a possible prior testing phase specified by YAZIO and communicated to the User (trial subscription), the usage fee for the subscription first becomes due after the last day of the testing phase. After the testing phase, the usage fee for the respective subscription period becomes due immediately and is payable by the User in advance. If the limited-time subscription is not preceded by a testing phase, the usage fee for the respective subscription period is due immediately and is payable immediately after completion of the purchase.
(2) The User is obliged to pay all costs incurred if an outstanding payment cannot be collected from a bank account specified by the User. If payments that were made are charged back, or if the User does not pay fees, YAZIO is entitled to block all Services or access to individual ones.
(3) In-app purchases are billed via the respective Distribution Platform. The terms of payment specified by the respective platform operator shall apply.
§ 9 Changes to the usage fee
The Provider reserves the right to change the usage fee for the subscription options. Price changes will only become effective when valid after the end of the subscription period or when the subscription renewal is due for payment. In the event of upcoming price increases, the Provider shall notify the User at least 30 days before the planned change of the usage fee. If the notification of the price increase is made less than 30 days in advance, the change shall take effect only after the next payment date.
§ 10 Changes, interruptions, discontinuation of YAZIO Services
(1) The Provider is free to change its Services at any time and when doing so to, e.g., change, interrupt or discontinue the free services of the YAZIO App at any time, temporarily or permanently, and in whole or in part. This also applies to the offer of limited-time subscriptions.
(2) The Provider shall inform the User at least 30 days before planned changes, interruptions, or discontinuation of fee-based services. The Provider will publish the updated usage fees.
(3) The User has the right to cancel his or her subscription without notice if the change, interruption, or discontinuation of the service causes unreasonable disadvantage to the User or the contractual balance between the parties is otherwise significantly disturbed. If the User exercises his or her right to cancellation, he or she may be entitled to a pro rata refund for the unused portion of the cancelled subscription. The Provider is solely responsible for any refunds granted under these terms.
(4) The subscription with the respective booked term ends if the Provider or the corresponding Distribution Platform used by the Provider ceases provision of services or business operations.
(5) The present General Terms and Conditions also apply to changed services.
§ 11 Warranty for defects of quality, guarantee
(1) Insofar as the purchase agreement between the Provider and the User has been concluded, the Provider is liable for defects in the app in line with the applicable statutory provisions, particularly pursuant to the general provisions of Sections 434 et. seqq. of the German Civil Code (BGB). The warranty period for the app made available to Entrepreneurs by the Provider is twelve months.
(2) The Provider will make an effort to enable consistently complete and error-free availability of the YAZIO App but does not guarantee this.
§ 12 Liability
(1) User claims to compensation for damages are excluded. This does not include a User’s claims to compensation for damages for injury to life, limb, or health; damages caused by breach of material contractual obligations; or liability for other damages caused by a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty by the Provider, its legal representatives, or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are those obligations that are required to achieve the objective of the contract.
(2) If material contractual obligations are violated, the Provider is only liable for the typical foreseeable damage if such damage was caused by ordinary negligence, unless the User’s claim for compensation for damages is based on an injury to life, limb, or health.
(3) The limitations of subsections (1) and (2) shall also apply in favor of the Provider’s legal representatives or vicarious agents if claims are asserted directly against such persons.

The European Commission has made available a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR) (Art. 14, Para. 1 of the ODR Regulation and § 36 of the German Consumers’ Dispute Settlement Act (VSBG)). The platform serves as a point of contact for out-of-court dispute settlements regarding contractual obligations from sales contracts concluded online. You can find the platform under the following link:
ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr
§ 15 Final provisions
(1) Contracts entered into between the User and the Provider are subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Statutory provisions limiting the choice of law and the application of mandatory provisions, especially of the state where the User as the consumer has his or her habitual abode, remain unaffected.
(2) If the User is a merchant, a legal person under public law or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes under the contractual relationships between the User and the Provider shall be the registered office of the Provider.
(3) If individual items are legally invalid, the remainder of the contract shall remain valid. Whenever such provisions exist, the statutory provisions shall replace the invalid provisions. If this would constitute undue hardship for one of the contracting parties, the entire contract shall be deemed invalid.
(4) YAZIO’s General Terms and Conditions are available to Users in various languages. The German-language version is the original source for these General Terms and Conditions and, in the case of disputes, misunderstandings, or inconsistencies, is the authoritative version and shall take precedence over all translated versions.

Preamble

    counter (hereinafter, the “App” or the “Product”) for Android and iOS.
The following Data Protection Policy informs you about the types of personal
    data of YAZIO users that are processed, the purposes for which they are
    processed, and the scope of processing. The Data Protection Policy applies
    to all processing of personal data performed by YAZIO, both in connection
    with service provision and, in particular, on the Website and in the YAZIO
    App, which users can install on their mobile end device, as well as within
    external online presences, such as YAZIO’s social media profiles
    (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “Online Offer”).
1. Controller & Data Protection Officer
The controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR)—i.e., the entity responsible for collecting, processing and using
    personal user data—is

Germany
help@yazio.com
In addition to the controller, the user can also contact YAZIO’s data

2. Encryption
All incoming and outgoing data—both in the communication with the Apps and
    in third-party provider communication—are transmitted in encrypted form. The
    encrypted connection when using the YAZIO Website can be seen, for instance,
    via the address bar of the browser being used, which begins with “https://”,
    and via the encryption symbol found there. Because of encryption, the
    transmitted data cannot be read by third parties.
3. Collection, Processing, & Use of Personal Data
3.1. Personal data
“Personal data” for the purposes of the GDPR means any information relating
    to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural
    person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular
    by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
    location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
    the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
    identity of that natural person;
Personal data (e.g., e-mail address, nutritional data in the App) will be
    processed by the Provider only pursuant to the provisions of applicable data
    protection law. The following provisions inform you about the nature, scope
    and purpose of the collection, processing and use of personal data.
3.2. Collection of data when using the YAZIO Website
When visiting the Website www.yazio.com, the web server, on the basis of
    YAZIO's legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, automatically
    records log files, which cannot be attributed to any specific person, if
    this is necessary for the App’s functionality and is not outweighed by the
    interest in protecting the user's personal data. These data include, e.g.,
    the browser type and version, the operating system used, referrer URL (the
    previously visited site), IP address of the requesting computer, access date
    and time of server request, and the file requested by the client (file name
    and URL). These data are collected only for the purpose of statistical
    analysis and for security reasons (e.g., to investigate acts of misuse or
    fraud) and are stored for seven days and then erased. If it should be
    necessary to retain the data for a longer period of time for evidentiary
    purposes, they are exempt from erasure until final resolution of the
    respective event.
3.2.1. Provision of the Website
The IT infrastructure and associated services are provided by the web
    hosting service dogado GmbH, Antonio-Segni-Straße 11, 44263 Dortmund,
    Germany. dogado GmbH is a cloud service provider and offers a platform for
    internet-based business processes. For the hosting tools, only the personal
    data collected by YAZIO will be stored on the servers of dogado GmbH. These
    include, in particular, meta and communication data, contact data, such as
    names and addresses, contract and payment data and content data (completed
    forms). In this regard, the data are processed only to the extent necessary
    for fulfilling the hosting contract. The data protection policy and other
    information of dogado GmbH can be found
    here:
https://www.dogado.de/legal/datenschutz
.
3.2.2. Use of cookies
In order to make the Website more user friendly and more effective overall,
    YAZIO itself or third parties engaged by YAZIO for this purpose store
    cookies on the user’s hard drive, provided the user has consented to this in
    accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
A cookie is a small text file that is used, inter alia, to record
    information with respect to use of a website. These cookies cannot execute
    programs or transmit viruses to the user’s computer. They do not contain any
    personal data, cannot be attributed to specific persons, and, unless
    described otherwise, will be automatically deleted after one year, at the
    latest. These data are not combined with other data sources.
It is also possible to use websites operated by the Provider without
    cookies. The storage of cookies can be deactivated or limited to certain
    websites in the respective browser, or the browser can be configured in such
    a way that it notifies the user once a cookie is sent. The user can also
    delete cookies from the hard drive of their PC at any time.
3.3. Personal data when using the YAZIO App
3.3.1. Required information when creating a personalized user account
In order to be able to use the App, the user must provide the required
    information “e-mail address” and “password”. These are used to identify the
    user and for the purpose of communication between the Provider and the user.
    The e-mail address and all other user data cannot be viewed by other users.
    A different situation applies only if the user is using the “Buddies”
    feature (see 3.3.8). The data are stored on the basis of the consent of each
    user under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
3.3.2. Use of the YAZIO app with the feature "Sign Up With Apple" / "Continue With Apple"
The user has the option to create a YAZIO account via his or her Apple account. The user can register for or log in to YAZIO with this Apple account if he or she uses the "Sign Up With Apple" button on the website or the "Continue With Apple" button in the app when registering.
    When logging in using the Apple ID, the personal e-mail address can be
    hidden or shared with YAZIO. With “Hide e-mail address”, the user can use
    Apple's e-mail relay service to generate a generic alias address through
    which messages from YAZIO are forwarded to their private e-mail address.
    “Continue with Apple'' uses two-factor authentication. An additional
    password does not have to be assigned. Further information about the method
    of operation and settings is available at:
https://support.apple.com/HT210425
.
The watchOS app for the Apple Watch can additionally be downloaded and used
    through the Apple Watch itself, unless it is automatically coupled with the
    user's iPhone. In this case, registration must take place using the feature
    “Continue With Apple”.
3.3.3. Use of the YAZIO app with the feature "Sign Up With Google" / "Continue With Google"
The user has the option to create a YAZIO account via his or her Google account. The user can register for or log in to YAZIO with this Google account if he or she uses the "Sign Up With Google" button on the website or the "Continue With Google" button in the app when registering.
    In this regard, YAZIO collects and stores the user's personal data through
    the Google account, such as the user's e-mail address, optionally also first
    and last names, and the user's profile picture. The user can individually
    adjust the data transfer to YAZIO in their Google account under privacy
    settings. Further information about the method of operation and settings is
    available at:
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2541991
.
3.3.4. Use of the YAZIO App without personalized user account
An existing anonymous user account can be converted into a personalized account at any time by adding an e-mail address and password.
It is not possible to attribute an anonymous account to a user, meaning that
    if the mobile end device is lost, it is not possible for YAZIO to restore
    the account.
3.3.5. Data provided by the user
When creating a personalized user account, the user can optionally provide,
    in addition to the required information (e-mail address and password), first
    name, last name and place of residence, which are then recorded by YAZIO.
In addition, YAZIO records data that are provided by the user through a
    personalized or anonymous user account, which can be entered when using the
    App. This comprises a user profile, which includes, but is not limited to,
    the below-listed body and health data:
Age/date of birth
Gender
Height
Diet (e.g., vegan)
Goal (e.g., lose weight)
Activity level (high/low)
Recorded activities
Calories consumption and activity calories
Steps
Starting weight, weight progress and target weight
Blood pressure
Status of the App user (PRO subscription in place: yes/no)
Fasting details (e.g., hours fasted)
Water consumption
Favorite recipes
The data are collected on the basis of the user’s consent under Article
    6(1)(a) GDPR. The provision of body data is necessary in order to be able to
    use the App's features. In particular, it is necessary to provide starting
    weight/target weight, gender, date of birth and height so YAZIO can
    calculate the user's personal calorie goal.
Other data, such as water consumption, enable the user to track the amount
    of water they drink. These data are used solely for the stated purposes and,
    as a rule, cannot be seen by third parties. A different situation applies
    only if the user is using the “Buddies” feature (see 3.3.8.).
3.3.6. Data automatically recorded by YAZIO
When the App is installed, the following are recorded one time:
Date of installation
Date of registration
Operating system of the device used (Android/iOS)
Country and language (using locale: the “locale” is a set of
            settings that contains the region parameters (local parameters) for
            computer programs. These primarily include the language of the user
            interface, the country and settings for the character set, keyboard
            layout, and formats for payments, currencies, dates and times.)
These data are recorded in order to improve and personalize our services,
    and this takes place on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to
    Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
3.3.7. Data recorded while using the App
When the App is being used, YAZIO furthermore records the following:
Current IP address
App version being used
Current time zone
These data are recorded in order to improve and personalize the offered
    services, and this takes place on the basis of YAZIO’s legitimate interest
    pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
3.3.8. Sharing data with a friend
Every user has the ability to share their data entered under No. 3.3.5 with
    other App users (“friends” or “buddies”). To invite friends, a personal link
    is generated in the Buddies section, which can be forwarded to the selected
    friend(s). This link is valid only one time, i.e., even if it is sent to a
    group of friends, it can only be used one time, namely by the friend who
    clicks on the link first. Messenger services installed on the user’s device
    are available for sharing the link. Applicable are the data protection
    policies of the messenger services used to send the link.
The data entered under No. 3.3.5 and shared via a personal link will be
    displayed to the invited friends in the Buddies section. Only the current
    day's data are visible to friends in the buddies list, i.e., data from the
    day before are no longer visible for the friends list and are not open to
    tracking.
This data exchange can be ended by the users or by invited friend(s) at any
    time. After the friend is deleted from the Buddies list, no further data
    will be shared with that friend. The friend removed from the Buddies list
    does not receive any notification that they have been removed.
3.3.9. Contractual relationship and payment procedure
Where a contractual relationship between the user and YAZIO is to be
    established, substantively structured or changed, YAZIO stores personal data
    of the user on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (see the list of personal
    data under No. 3.3.5 to 3.3.7), provided this is necessary for the
    performance of the contract. Through an in-app purchase, the user has the
    ability to acquire a PRO version of the YAZIO App in connection with a
    subscription, optionally at the start of a seven-day free trial phase (trial
    subscription). If the user decides to acquire the PRO version and presses
    the order button, they will be forwarded directly to the Apple App Store,
    the Google Play Store or the Huawei AppGallery, depending on their operating
    system, even if they had first opted for the seven-day free trial phase
    during the temporary subscription. In that case, the corresponding amount
    for the subscription will be automatically debited after the seventh day of
    the trial phase.
When the user is forwarded to the appropriate app store, YAZIO transmits the
    starting and ending date and, if applicable, the subscription termination
    date, as well as the reason for termination (e.g., after a possible
    cancellation). The payment processing data are collected directly by the app
    stores. The data protection policies of the app stores can be viewed here:
Apple App Store:
https://www.apple.com/privacy/
Google Play Store:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
Huawei AppGallery:
https://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/
The PRO version of the App can also be purchased through the YAZIO Website.
    Depending on the selected payment option (Apple Pay, Google Pay, SEPA
    payment or credit card payment), the user must provide the relevant account
    data, even if they are first using the seven-day trial subscription.
Applicable to the payment transactions are the business terms and conditions
    and the data protection policies of the respective payment service
    providers, which are available on the respective websites or transaction
    apps:
Further processing is handled by the payment service provider
            Stripe. The service is offered by Stripe Payments Europe Ltd, Block
            4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland. Information
            provided by the user (name, e-mail address, credit card data, start
            and end date, and, if applicable, termination data of subscriptions,
            invoice amount) is transmitted by YAZIO to Stripe pursuant to
            Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as part of the order process. User data are
            shared solely for the purpose of payment processing with the payment
            service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd. and only to the extent

            Inc., One Infinite Loop, 95014 Cupertino, USA, available to users in
            the YAZIO App. When Apple Pay is used, Apple does not store any
            original credit card, debit card or prepaid card numbers used by the
            user. Apple has no access to them. In addition, no backup of
            transaction data takes place that permits conclusions to be drawn as
            to the user.

            made by the user and the payment method selected (debit or credit
            card). It collects data such as date, time, merchant location,
            merchant name and merchandise description. Google may combine these
            data with the information of other Google services that the user
            uses with their Google account.

4. Exchange of Data With Third Parties
YAZIO takes the protection of personal user data very seriously. For this
    reason, YAZIO treats personal data confidentially and in accordance with
    statutory provisions concerning data protection as well as this Data
    Protection Policy. YAZIO therefore collects and stores only data that are
    provided by third-party providers on the basis of the respective user
    consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and transmits corresponding data to them.
    Subject to statutory or contractual permissions, YAZIO processes the data in
    a third country or has the data processed there only where the special
    requirements of Articles 44 et seqq. GDPR are met. Processing takes place,
    e.g., on the basis of special safeguards, such as the observance of
    officially recognized, special contractual obligations (“standard contract
    clauses”).
If the European Commission does not attribute to a third country the same
    level of data protection as the EU, then YAZIO ensures the maintenance of
    the European level of data protection through the use of standard contract
    clauses (SCC) and binding company rules pursuant to Article 46(1) and (2)(c)
    GDPR. Nevertheless, it is possible under certain circumstances that
    authorities in a third country may access user data for control and
    monitoring purposes and, in this regard, that effective legal remedies and
    data subject rights may not be enforceable.

8. Newsletter & Mailings
YAZIO regularly notifies its users by e-mail about current diet trends,
    recipes and other interesting offers and tips from the field of nutrition,
    weight loss, etc. Registration is voluntary and takes place using a double
    opt-in procedure. After registering, the user receives an e-mail requesting
    that they confirm their registration. This is necessary so that a third
    party cannot register to receive the newsletter using someone else's e-mail
    address. In order to document that the registration meets the legal
    requirements, it is logged on the basis of YAZIO's legitimate interest
    pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
As part of registration on the Website or in the App, the user consents to
    the processing of the provided data for the purpose of sending and receiving
    e-mails (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). Furthermore, the user consents that YAZIO
    may collect and process data about their usage behavior (namely, opening the
    e-mail and clicking on links in it) so that the content of the mailings can
    be tailored to the respective needs, e.g., if a user repeatedly clicks on
    links about topic A but not about topic B, they will receive only links
    about topic A in future mailings.
The consent granted by the user to receive these emails may be withdrawn at
    any time and without providing reasons with prospective effect by sending an
    e-mail to
help@yazio.com
.
In addition, receipt can be stopped by using a link found at the end of each
    newsletter. YAZIO may store the provided e-mail address and the data stored
    in connection with logging the registration for up to three years on the
    basis of its legitimate interest in order to be able to demonstrate that
    consent had previously been given. The processing of these data is limited
    to the purpose of possible defense against claims. An individual erasure
    request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of
    consent is confirmed at the same time.
The newsletter, as well as transactional-emails, is sent via “SparkPost”, an
    e-mail marketing platform of the U.S. provider Message Systems Inc., 9160
    Guilford Road, Columbia, Maryland 21046, USA. The data protection provisions
    of SparkPost can be viewed here:
https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/privacy
. SparkPost may use the data of recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e., with
    attribution to a user, for the purpose of optimizing or improving its own
    services, e.g., for technical optimization of the sending and presentation
    of the newsletter and the transaction e-mail or for statistical purposes.
    However, SparkPost does not use the data of YAZIO mailing recipients to
    contact them directly or to share the data with third parties.
In addition, YAZIO uses Iterable, a cross-channel marketing platform of
    Iterable Inc., 71 Stevenson St, #300 San Francisco, CA 94105, USA. Iterable
    helps YAZIO get in touch with its users through e-mails, push notifications
    and in-app messages. Moreover, with the aid of Iterable, it is possible for
    YAZIO to collect data about how users interact with their mobile
    applications. For instance, YAZIO can segment its mailing recipients by
    category, such as age, gender, personal goal, diet and App use, track
    openings, clicks and conversions, and create automated, triggered
    cross-channel campaigns. Further notices about data protection, particularly
    about assurance of the level of data protection when data are processed in
    third countries, are available at
https://iterable.com/trust/privacy-policy/
.
The aforementioned service providers are utilized based on YAZIO’s
    legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and a processing
    contract pursuant to Article 28(3) GDPR.
9. Use by Children
YAZIO is aware of the importance of additional measures to protect the
    privacy of children. Persons under the age of 16 may not open an account
    unless a parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. Should
    YAZIO learn that personal data about a child under the minimum age were
    collected without parental consent, YAZIO will initiate steps to erase these
    data without delay. Parents who believe that their child has sent us
    personal data and would like to have these erased should contact YAZIO using
    the contact data provided in No. 1.
10. Use of Tools for Web analysis, Remarketing & Retargeting
Based on the user's consent within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR,
    YAZIO utilizes various tools and plug-ins for the purpose of web analysis,
    remarketing and retargeting. In doing so, cookies are used that forward the
    IP address and/or record and analyze different types of data. This includes,
    for example, the number of Website visitors, visit duration, average
    page-loading time and visitor origin. These cookies are used for the purpose
    of being able to put together more targeted offers for YAZIO users.
Specifically:
10.1. Google Tag Manager/Google Analytics/Google Optimize/Google Analytics
    by Firebase
YAZIO utilizes Google Tag Manager on its Website. The provider is Google
    Ireland Ltd. (“Google”), Google Building Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
    4, Ireland. Google Tag Manager is a tool used to embed tracking or
    statistics tools and other technologies on the Website. Google Tag Manager
    does not itself create any user profiles, store any cookies, or perform any
    independent analyses. It is merely used to manage and run the tools embedded
    through it. For this purpose, however, Google Tag Manager records certain
    aggregated data for the purpose of diagnosing how the tracking and
    statistics tools are running. These data do not contain any IP addresses or
    IDs that can be linked to a specific person.
YAZIO uses Google Analytics and Google Optimize on the Website and in the
    App for the purpose of analyzing use of the Website. The provider of both
    web analysis services is Google Ireland Ltd. (“Google”), Google Building
    Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google Optimize is a tool integrated in Google Analytics. It enables the
    Provider to adjust and improve parts of its Website in a targeted manner to
    match user behavior.
Firebase provides app developers with a technical infrastructure and a
    variety of tools, including Google Analytics by Firebase. With it, YAZIO can
    record and analyze user behavior in order to adjust the App to meet the
    needs of users and to better control features and events. Google Analytics
    and Google Optimize use cookies, which facilitate an analysis of the use of
    the Website by users. The information generated by the cookie about user
    activities on this Website is normally transferred to a Google server in the
    U.S. and stored there. On behalf of YAZIO, Google uses this information in
    order to evaluate user activities on the Website, to compile reports about
    Website activities for YAZIO, and to provide additional services associated
    with Website use and internet use. In addition, Google will, if necessary,
    transmit this information to third parties if this is required by law or if
    third parties process these data on behalf of Google.
Further information about Google's use of data for marketing purposes can be
    found at
https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads

    If the user wishes to object to interest-related advertising by Google
    marketing services, they can use the settings and opt-out options provided
    by Google at

10.2. Google Ads Remarketing/conversion tracking
On the Website and in the App, the Provider uses Google Ads Remarketing, an
    online advertising program of Google Ireland Ltd. (“Google”), Google
    Building Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. In connection with
    Google Ads Remarketing, YAZIO uses what is known as conversion tracking. If
    the user clicks on an advertisement placed by Google, a cookie is set for
    the conversion tracking. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and
    are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages
    on this Website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the Provider
    can recognize that the user clicked on the advertisement and was redirected
    to this site.
Each Google Ads Remarketing customer receives a different cookie. The
    cookies cannot be tracked across the websites of Ads Remarketing customers.
    The information obtained with the aid of conversion cookies is used to
    compile conversion statistics for Ads Remarketing customers that have
    elected to use conversion tracking. Customers learn about the total number
    of users who clicked on their advertisements and were redirected to a site
    furnished with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any
    information that can be used to identify the user. If a user wishes to
    decline to take part in tracking, they can object to such use by
    deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie through their internet
    browser under user settings. In addition, the user can prevent the capture
    and processing by Google of the data generated by the cookie relating to
    their use of the Website (including their IP address) by downloading and
    installing the browser plug-in available at the following link:
    tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. The user will then no longer be included
    in conversion tracking statistics. However, this will likely limit the
    functionality of this Website.
The information generated by the cookie about the user's use of this Website
    is transferred to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. In the event
    of activation of IP anonymization on this Website, however, the user’s IP
    address is first truncated by Google within the Member States of the
    European Union or in other Contracting States of the Agreement on the
    European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
    transferred to a Google server in the U.S. and truncated there. Google uses
    this information on behalf of the operator of this Website in order to
    evaluate the user's activity on the Website, to compile reports about
    Website activities, and to provide other services to the Website operator
    associated with Website use and internet use.

    the success of YAZIO marketing campaigns. With the aid of AppsFlyer, YAZIO
    collects and stores data about the use of its Website by utilizing a
    pseudonym. The usage profiles created in this way are used to analyze
    visitor behavior and to improve our Website and design it to be in line with
    needs. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Absent express consent to be
    granted by the user, the pseudonymised usage profiles will not be combined
    with other personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym.
The user may object to the collection and storage of data by AppsFlyer at
    any time with prospective effect by following the instructions
    at

    displayed to the user as the top result when the user searches in the App
    Store.

    display relevant advertising to them. In addition, the user can prevent

    automatically in technical terms and in terms of content, appear in the
    so-called “discovery feed” and point out content on the Provider's Website
    or third-party websites that also may be of interest to the user.
Reading recommendations, which usually appear below an article, are
    determined by the content read previously by the user. To display
    interest-based content, Outbrain uses cookies that are stored on the user's
    end device. The information generated by the cookie about the user’s device
    source, browser type and IP address is normally transferred to an Outbrain
    server in the U.S. and stored there, whereby the last octet is deleted for
    anonymization purposes.
The user can at any time prevent tracking for the purpose of displaying
    content recommendations by Outbrain at
https://my.outbrain.com/recommendations-settings/home
by clicking on the “refuse”

    Taboola integrates content recommendation on websites. The recommendations,
    which are managed and delivered by Taboola automatically in technical terms
    and in terms of content, appear in the so-called “discovery feed” and point
    out content on the Provider's Website or third-party websites that may also
    be of interest to the user. The Taboola cookies enable the Provider to
    target visitors to its Website with customized advertisements.
For this purpose, Taboola stores a small file with a number sequence in the
    browser of the visitor to the Website that records the visitor to the
    Website and anonymized data about use of the Website. In addition, with the
    aid of the cookies, Taboola evaluates and supports online marketing measures
    for registering the effectiveness of advertisements for statistical purposes
    and for market research purposes.

    Through the embedding of the plug-in, Facebook receives information that a
    user has visited the corresponding page of the Online Offer. If the user is
    logged in to Facebook, Facebook can allocate the visit to their Facebook
    account. If users interact with the plug-in, e.g., share the Website using
    the Facebook “Share” button, the corresponding information will be
    transmitted from their device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a
    user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that
    Facebook will learn their IP address and store it. According to Facebook,

General Terms and Conditions
§ 1 Scope of application
(1) These General Terms and Conditions of YAZIO GmbH, Kartäuserstr. 3a, 99084 Erfurt, govern the use of YAZIO services on the YAZIO website yazio.com (hereinafter, the “Website”) and mobile application (hereinafter, the “App” or the “YAZIO App”). They apply regardless of whether the App is used free of charge or for a fee.
(2) Only the following General Terms and Conditions apply between YAZIO GmbH (hereinafter, also the “Provider” or “YAZIO”) and the user of YAZIO services (hereinafter, the “User”) as amended at the time of use. Deviating terms and conditions of the User shall not be recognized, unless the Provider expressly agrees to their validity.
§ 2 Definition of terms
(1) YAZIO offers its Users a program that is tailored to the topics of weight loss, weight gain, muscle building and healthy nutrition, and through the YAZIO App and on yazio.com, it offers a number of ways for Users to become familiar with these topics (hereinafter, also the “Services”).
(2) The terms “Consumer” and “Entrepreneur” correspond to the legal definitions in Sections 13 and 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB). Thus, the User is herein the “Consumer,” insofar as the use or purchase of the YAZIO App cannot be assigned primarily to the User’s commercial or self-employed professional activity. In contrast, “Entrepreneur” refers to any natural or legal person or partnership with legal capacity that acts in exercise of its trade, business, or profession when using the YAZIO App or entering into the contract.
(3) “Distribution Platform” refers to the shops (stores) of platform operators, such as Google (“Google Play”) and Apple (“App Store”), where the User can select and download the YAZIO App to be installed on the User’s device.
§ 3 Use of the YAZIO Services
(1) The YAZIO Services can be used free of charge or for a fee. This also applies, in particular, to use of the Services via the YAZIO App. The App is always free of charge when installed through a Distribution Platform. Use for a fee always requires special, express consent by the User in the App (see below § 5 and § 6).
(2) As a general rule, the YAZIO App can be installed and operated on all YAZIO-supported platforms and end devices, including mobile phones, smartwatches, tablets, and other mobile devices.
(3) By using the Website or installing the App, the User accepts these General Terms and Conditions. If the User downloaded the App from a third-party Distribution Platform and accesses YAZIO Services through the App, then the respective terms and conditions of business and/or use of the Distribution Platform apply in addition. Where conflicts arise as a result of this, these General Terms and Conditions take precedence.
(4) The User confirms that his or her information is true, accurate, current, and complete. Regular updates of personal information are required.
(5) The User is not permitted to circumvent technologies used to control geographic or other access in order to use fee-based services of YAZIO without authorization.
(6) The User is obliged to protect his or her account from unauthorized account access and misuse. Suspicious activity and possible violations are to be reported to the Provider immediately. Any possible reimbursement of unauthorized payments will be made only after successful reporting of the misuse.
(7) If the Provider detects abusive conduct of a User, the Provider is entitled to close the respective account.
(8) You must be at least 16 years of age to use our App, unless a parent or legal guardian has consented to the installation and subsequent use of our App in accordance with the applicable law. Should YAZIO learn that personal data of a minor younger than the minimum age was collected without parental consent, the Provider will take the necessary steps to delete these data without delay.
§ 4 Health notice for YAZIO Services
(1) The Provider is not a medical organization, and its recommendations do not constitute medical advice. Due to possible unintended weight loss associated with the use of the YAZIO Services, the User is advised to consult a doctor in individual cases before using the YAZIO Services to discuss individual recommendations made by the Provider. This especially applies to users who are already receiving medical treatment or are taking prescription medication to treat a clinically diagnosed condition. The Provider recommends using the YAZIO Services under a doctor’s supervision and that regular medical check-ups be performed. The Provider accepts no responsibility for the actions of the User. None of the content is intended to supplement or replace information provided by a doctor or pharmacist. By agreeing to these General Terms and Conditions, the User confirms that he or she is solely responsible for his or her health.
(2) The Provider recommends that the User maintains his or her weight in accordance with the guidelines for healthy weight specified by the World Health Organization (WHO), which corresponds to a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 25. The BMI can be calculated using the following formula: body weight (in kg) divided by height (in m) squared.
§ 5 Setting up a user account
(1) The YAZIO App can be operated with or without a personalized user account. If a personalized user account is created, the User is required to enter his or her e-mail address and choose a password. The User can convert his or her existing anonymous account into a personal user account at any time by linking his or her e-mail address with the user account.
(2) To use the YAZIO App with the Apple Watch, the only requirement is the creation of a user account via “Sign in with Apple,” even if the Apple Watch is not paired with the User’s iPhone.
(3) The YAZIO App can also be used by linking it with the User’s profile at platform operator, e.g. by creating a YAZIO user account via “Sign in with Google”.
§ 6 Term and cancellation of free Services
If YAZIO Services are used free of charge, the contract of use may be canceled by either YAZIO or the User with 14 days’ notice sent to help@yazio.com or the User’s e-mail address on file, respectively. In addition, the User has the ability to delete the account in the App settings.
§ 7 Term, term renewal and cancellation of fee-based Services
(1) YAZIO offers Users subscriptions with various fixed terms and a usage fee specific for each term, which is payable in advance in order to be able to use all Services without limitation (hereinafter, also “YAZIO PRO” or “PRO Functions”).
(2) If the User wishes to use the functionality of the paid version of the YAZIO App, the User can purchase the PRO functions via the YAZIO Website as well as upgrade the app using an “in-app purchase” via a Distribution Platform.
(a) To purchase the PRO functions via the Provider’s Website, the User must log in with his or her e-mail address and password or reregister. In his or her user account, the User can view and purchase different subscription options on the corresponding product page.
(b) If the User carries out the upgrade via a Distribution Platform, the specific procedure shall be governed by the respective platform operator. The purchase agreement shall take place according to the terms and conditions of the respective Distribution Platform. These terms and conditions also determine whether the purchase agreement is to be made between the User and the Distribution Platform or between the User and the Provider.
(3) Where the subscription is purchased on the Website or through a Distribution Platform, e.g. the Google Play Store or the App Store, YAZIO may temporarily offer Users the option to use the chosen subscription free of charge for a YAZIO-specified period of time (trial subscription). The trial subscription begins on the date on which the purchase process is concluded. The User will be notified of the testing phase when signing up for the trial subscription. A fee will not be charged during the testing phase, but YAZIO may require the User to provide his or her payment details at the start of the trial subscription. If the User does not cancel the trial subscription during the period of the testing phase specified by YAZIO, the trial subscription automatically converts to a fee-based, limited-time subscription. The User will be notified of this and must provide his or her consent. The User will automatically be charged the relevant usage fee for the subscription after the last day of the YAZIO-specified testing phase. The PRO Functions will be automatically activated for the User after the purchase is completed. YAZIO may at any time change the scope of the Services for the trial subscription or discontinue offering a trial subscription.
(4) The limited-time subscription runs for at least the term originally chosen by the User, plus any preceding trial subscription period specified by YAZIO.
(5) The User may cancel the subscription at any time, effective at the end of the chosen term. If it is not canceled, the subscription renews for an unlimited period of time at the purchase conditions of the initial subscription and may be canceled by YAZIO or the User at any time with one month’s notice, effective at the end of the month. If the User paid in advance, differential amounts will be refunded.
(6) If the subscription was purchased at yazio.com, notice of cancellation is to be sent using the cancellation button found in the footer, in the App or by e-mail to help@yazio.com. If the Provider cancels, the User is to be canceled using the e-mail address on file. If the subscription was purchased through a Distribution Platform, it can be canceled in the manner described in the respective app store under subscription management.
(7) The right to cancel without notice for cause remains unaffected. Cause for YAZIO exists, in particular, where the User violates applicable law or material contractual duties. In addition, the arrangements in § 10 remain unaffected.
(8) If the User dies, his or her heirs are entitled to cancel the subscription in accordance with subsections 5 to 7.
§ 8 Payment of the usage fee
(1) After purchasing the YAZIO PRO functions via the YAZIO Website, the User will receive an invoice for the outstanding usage fee, unless another method of payment has been agreed upon. If the User opts for a limited-time subscription with a possible prior testing phase specified by YAZIO and communicated to the User (trial subscription), the usage fee for the subscription first becomes due after the last day of the testing phase. After the testing phase, the usage fee for the respective subscription period becomes due immediately and is payable by the User in advance. If the limited-time subscription is not preceded by a testing phase, the usage fee for the respective subscription period is due immediately and is payable immediately after completion of the purchase.
(2) The User is obliged to pay all costs incurred if an outstanding payment cannot be collected from a bank account specified by the User. If payments that were made are charged back, or if the User does not pay fees, YAZIO is entitled to block all Services or access to individual ones.
(3) In-app purchases are billed via the respective Distribution Platform. The terms of payment specified by the respective platform operator shall apply.
§ 9 Changes to the usage fee
The Provider reserves the right to change the usage fee for the subscription options. Price changes will only become effective when valid after the end of the subscription period or when the subscription renewal is due for payment. In the event of upcoming price increases, the Provider shall notify the User at least 30 days before the planned change of the usage fee. If the notification of the price increase is made less than 30 days in advance, the change shall take effect only after the next payment date.
§ 10 Changes, interruptions, discontinuation of YAZIO Services
(1) The Provider is free to change its Services at any time and when doing so to, e.g., change, interrupt or discontinue the free services of the YAZIO App at any time, temporarily or permanently, and in whole or in part. This also applies to the offer of limited-time subscriptions.
(2) The Provider shall inform the User at least 30 days before planned changes, interruptions, or discontinuation of fee-based services. The Provider will publish the updated usage fees.
(3) The User has the right to cancel his or her subscription without notice if the change, interruption, or discontinuation of the service causes unreasonable disadvantage to the User or the contractual balance between the parties is otherwise significantly disturbed. If the User exercises his or her right to cancellation, he or she may be entitled to a pro rata refund for the unused portion of the cancelled subscription. The Provider is solely responsible for any refunds granted under these terms.
(4) The subscription with the respective booked term ends if the Provider or the corresponding Distribution Platform used by the Provider ceases provision of services or business operations.
(5) The present General Terms and Conditions also apply to changed services.
§ 11 Warranty for defects of quality, guarantee
(1) Insofar as the purchase agreement between the Provider and the User has been concluded, the Provider is liable for defects in the app in line with the applicable statutory provisions, particularly pursuant to the general provisions of Sections 434 et. seqq. of the German Civil Code (BGB). The warranty period for the app made available to Entrepreneurs by the Provider is twelve months.
(2) The Provider will make an effort to enable consistently complete and error-free availability of the YAZIO App but does not guarantee this.
§ 12 Liability
(1) User claims to compensation for damages are excluded. This does not include a User’s claims to compensation for damages for injury to life, limb, or health; damages caused by breach of material contractual obligations; or liability for other damages caused by a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty by the Provider, its legal representatives, or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are those obligations that are required to achieve the objective of the contract.
(2) If material contractual obligations are violated, the Provider is only liable for the typical foreseeable damage if such damage was caused by ordinary negligence, unless the User’s claim for compensation for damages is based on an injury to life, limb, or health.
(3) The limitations of subsections (1) and (2) shall also apply in favor of the Provider’s legal representatives or vicarious agents if claims are asserted directly against such persons.
§ 13 Instructions on right of withdrawal
(1) If the contract is entered into with YAZIO (and not the platform operator), the User, where he or she is a consumer, has a statutory right of withdrawal against the Provider, as explained in detail below.
(2) Instructions on right of withdrawal

(3) If individual items are legally invalid, the remainder of the contract shall remain valid. Whenever such provisions exist, the statutory provisions shall replace the invalid provisions.
