Information GAMSIFY collects when you use the Games:
GAMSIFY may collect the following information when you use the Games:
If there is a need to create an Account, you may be required to provide your name, e-mail address, a password and other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account. We may do this through in-Game dialog boxes, which you may choose to skip.
If you were to sign into one of the Site or Games through a social network, GAMSIFY may be able to access certain information about you through that Social Network. For example on Facebook, your Facebook ID, information relating to your friends, profile picture, gender, language, geo-location or the device you are using. GAMSIFY will only access information which you have agreed to make available as part of your membership of such social networks. Your Account may be used to publicly identify you as part of social features of the Services, which may include user-to-user interaction, chat or messaging functionality, public leaderboards, head-to-head competition, and other similar features. We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that is visible to other Gamsify users. Your user profile may include a profile photo, a Gamsify username, your gender, biographic details that you provide, details about the Games you play, and a Gamsify user ID number that is created by Gamsify and used to identify your profile. The Gamsify username will be public and will be shown to other users, but will only permit access to information that is considered public or that you have designated as public in your user profile settings. We may also offer you the ability to import your contacts or manually enter e-mail addresses so that you can locate your contacts on Gamsify and invite your contacts to join you in the Games. You can change what information GAMSIFY can access by changing your privacy features on your social networks.
Information in relation to your purchases (when you order any good or service through the Game, including any virtual currency or virtual good) within the Games. These are handled through the platform on which you purchased the Game or other payment processors (e.g. the Apple App Store, Google Play, xBox Live, Playstation Network). GAMSIFY does not collect or retain any card or payment details. When you purchase items via our mobile apps (such as those you can purchase in the App Store, on Facebook or on Google Play) we do not collect or store any payment information from you.
GAMSIFY does keep a record of your purchases and your aggregate spending; and your Unique Device Identifier or a record of the internet browser which you are using when you play the Games. This may provide GAMSIFY with an approximate location as to where you are using the Games and on what device.
Please note that it is the platform providers (e.g. the Apple App Store, Google Play etc.) not GAMSIFY who control the payment process for in app purchases. Thus, any queries or application for refunds should be made directly to the platform provider. However, should you wish to contact us we would be more than happy to discuss any query you have with you. Information on how to complain about purchases can normally be found within invoices from platform providers.
Information Collected by Customer Support
When you ask for assistance from our Customer Support, we will collect and store the contact information you provide (generally your name, e-mail address, country, device language, device model, OS version and app version), information about your game play or activity on the Games, and your user name or ID number.

GAMSIFY may share your anonymised Unique Device Identifier and other relevant data with you with its partners to ensure that the ads you receive are relevant to you; your social networks (including Facebook), who may combine this information with other information they hold about you â€“ you should refer to your social network's privacy policy to see how they will use this information; any third party, in relation to the sale of some or all GAMSIFY's business, or its assets, or as part of any business restructuring or reorganization. GAMSIFY will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected;  data aggregators and service providers as part of an analysis of player metrics or sales performance and as further described in paragraph; or law enforcement agencies in compliance with law enforcement.
We use your information to provide the Service, to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and evaluate how the Service is used.

We also may use your information to contact you with communications such as marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
Push Notifications & Local Notifications
With your consent we or our service providers may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide Game updates and other relevant messages. You can adjust the types of notifications you receive and when you receive them by editing your notification settings. We or our service providers may also send local notifications to your mobile device to provide Game updates and other relevant information.
Technical and Usage Information
When you access our Services, we may collect (i) certain technical information about your mobile device or computer system, including IP Address, mobile device ID (IDFA, Google Advertising ID or other identifiers), and the version of your operating system; and (ii) usage statistics about your interactions with the Games. In certain Games we will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.

Online Advertising
The Service may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Service, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Service, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Service, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Service.
Offer Wall
We may in the future display an "offer wall" in our applications that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by GAMSIFY. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a Service hosted by GAMSIFY. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier and other information will be shared with the offer wall provider.
Invite a Friend
You may decide to provide us with another party's email address to allow us to contact and invite that party to visit or join the Service or so that GAMSIFY may facilitate your communication with such other party through methods of communication enabled by the Service (such as when you upload an address book). Such email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending email communications to the addressee.
