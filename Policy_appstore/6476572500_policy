Privacy Policy
Baseplate, Bulletin, Globetrotter, Saturn, Textcraft, Veil, and Vinyls were built independently by Shihab Mehboob, a UK based iOS app developer. I would never want my own privacy violated, so I'll treat your data how I'd want mine to be treated.
The apps do not collect or store any user data or information, apart from locally storing your data on device and on Apple's iCloud offering where applicable (you can find out more about their privacy policy
here
).
No third parties are used to collect or store data or analytics, and no services that may be used to identify or track you are used in this offering. No other services get access to the app or your data.
This website does not track you or your cookies, and does not ask for any information that can be used to identify you.
