          Services").
Article 1 (Privacy Information)
Among privacy information, "personal information" refers to
            "personal information" as defined in the Personal Information
            Protection Law, which is information related to a living
            individual, and includes information that can identify a specific
            individual by the name, date of birth, address, telephone number,
            contact information, and other descriptions contained in the
            information.
Among privacy information, "history and characteristic
            information" refers to information other than "personal
            information" defined above, and includes services used, products
            purchased, pages and advertisements viewed, search keywords
            entered by users, date and time of use, method of use, usage

              address, phone number, email address, bank account number,
              credit card number, and driver's license number when users
              register for our service. Additionally, we may collect
              transaction records containing personal information of users, as
              well as information related to payments, from our partners
              (including information providers, advertisers, and ad
              distributors, hereinafter referred to as "partners").
We collect users' history information and characteristic
              information, such as services and software used, products
              purchased, pages and ads viewed, search keywords, date and time
              of use, method of use, usage environment (including

              address, cookie information, location information, and device
              identification information when users use our services or view
              pages from us and our partners.
Article 3 (Purpose of Collecting and Using Personal Information)
The purposes for which we collect and use personal information are
            as follows:
(1) To display users' registration information, such as name,
              address, contact information, and payment methods, as well as
              information about services used, products purchased, and their
              fees, so that users can view and modify their own registration
              information and usage status.
(2) To use email addresses to send notifications and
              communications to users, and to use contact information such as
              name and address to send products or contact users as needed.
(3) To use information such as name, date of birth, address,
              phone number, bank account number, credit card number, driver's
              license number, and delivery confirmation results for the
              purpose of verifying users' identity.
(4) To use information such as product names and quantities
              purchased, types and duration of services used, number of times
              used, billing amount, name, address, bank account number, and
              credit card number for the purpose of billing users.
(5) To display registered information on input screens for
              users' convenience, and to transfer it to other services
              (including those provided by partners) based on users'
              instructions.
(6) To refuse usage of our service by users who violate the
              terms of use, such as delaying payments, causing damage to third
              parties, or attempting to use the service for fraudulent or
              improper purposes, by using information to identify individuals,
              such as usage patterns, name, and address.
(7) To use information required for providing services to users,
              such as inquiry content, billing information, service usage
              status, and contact information, for the purpose of responding
              to inquiries from users.
(8) For purposes incidental to the above usage purposes.
Article 4 (Provision of Personal Information to Third Parties)
Except as provided in the following cases, we will not provide
              personal information to third parties without the prior consent
              of the user. However, this does not apply in cases permitted by
              the Personal Information Protection Law or other laws and
              regulations.
(1) When required by law
(2) When it is necessary for the protection of a person's
                  life, body, or property, and it is difficult to obtain the
                  consent of the person
(3) When it is particularly necessary for the improvement of
                  public health or the promotion of the sound upbringing of
                  children, and it is difficult to obtain the consent of the
                  person
(4) When it is necessary to cooperate with a national agency
                  or local public body or their delegate in carrying out their
                  duties under the law, and obtaining the person's consent
                  would likely impede the performance of such duties
(5) In cases where the following matters have been announced
                  or made public in advance
That the purpose of use includes providing to third
                      parties
The items of data provided to third parties
The means or method of providing to third parties
That the provision of personal information to third
                      parties will be stopped upon the person's request
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the
              following cases shall not be considered as providing to third
              parties:
(1) When we entrust all or part of the handling of personal
                  information within the scope necessary for achieving the
                  purpose of use
(2) When personal information is provided due to a merger or
                  other reasons for business succession
(3) In cases where personal information is jointly used
                  between specific persons, and this fact, the items of
                  personal information to be jointly used, the scope of joint
                  users, the purpose of use by users, and the name or title of
                  the person responsible for the management of said personal
                  information has been notified to the person in advance, or
                  the person is placed in a position where they can easily
                  learn about it
Article 5 (Disclosure of Personal Information)
We will disclose personal information to the individual upon
              their request without delay. However, we may not disclose all or
              part of the information if doing so falls under any of the
              following circumstances. In such cases, we will notify the
              individual without delay. Please note that a handling fee of
              1,000 yen per request will be charged for the disclosure of
              personal information.
(1) If there is a risk of harming the life, body, property,
                  or other rights and interests of the individual or a third
                  party
(2) If there is a risk of causing significant hindrance to
                  the proper execution of our business
(3) If doing so would violate other laws and regulations
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, we
              will not disclose information other than personal information,
              such as history and characteristic information, in principle.
Article 6 (Correction and Deletion of Personal Information)
If a user finds that their personal information held by us is
              incorrect, they may request correction or deletion of their
              personal information by following the procedures specified by
              us.
If we determine that it is necessary to comply with a request
              received from a user under the preceding paragraph, we shall
              correct or delete the personal information without delay and
              notify the user accordingly.
Article 7 (Suspension of Use of Personal Information, etc.)
If we are requested by an individual to stop the use or deletion
            of their personal information on the grounds that it is being
            handled beyond the scope of the purpose of use, or that it was
            obtained through illegitimate means, we will promptly investigate
            the matter and, based on the results, suspend the use of the
            personal information or take other necessary measures, and notify
            the person concerned. However, if the suspension of use of
            personal information or other measures involve a large amount of
            cost or are otherwise difficult to implement, and if it is
            possible to take alternative measures to protect the rights and
            interests of the individual, we will take such alternative
            measures.

We may change the content of this policy without notifying
              users.
