Opens a mail link
, registered under HRB 100484 in the register of companies of the District Court of Braunschweig (

Volkswagen
AG in conjunction with your visit to the website.
B. Processing personal data
I. Processing of log files
When you visit our website, we process the following log files belonging to you, which cannot be traced back to you personally:
an anonymous cookie ID which cannot be traced back to your IP address;
your operating system, web browser and screen resolution;
the date and time of your visit;
which of our websites you visited;
the website you were on before you visited ours;
the IP address of the device you used to access the website.
We use the processor Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services, Inc.) to host this website. We cannot preclude the possibility that the information will be accessed by Amazon Web Services, Inc. which has its headquarters in the USA. Corresponding EU standard contractual clauses for the transmission of personal data to processors in third countries were concluded to ensure sufficient protection of your personal data. You can access the EU standard contractual clauses at the URL
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087

.
This data is processed in accordance with point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in properly displaying the website to you. The data is deleted after 30 days.
II. Dialogue Centre (customer care)
You can contact our Dialogue Centre by email. If you contact our Dialogue Centre, the information and data you provide (including personal data) shall be recorded digitally so that your enquiry can be dealt with. If you do not provide this information, we might be unable to process your enquiry.
If you contact our Dialogue Centre by email, the following data shall be collected at the very least: email address, place of residence (country) and language. We might ask for further information depending on the matter in question.
We shall process your personal data for the purposes of customer service and in order to contact you and process your query (see point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR).
We delete your data as soon as we have answered your query to your satisfaction, providing there are no other retention periods (e.g. fiscal retention periods) that come into conflict with this.
C. Use of cookies and tracking tools
I. General information
Volkswagen
AG uses various cookies on its websites. Cookies are small files containing configuration information which are stored on your device. Cookies can essentially be divided into three categories. Some cookies are essential for website functionality (known as functional cookies), some cookies make a website easier to use and save settings such as your language preferences (known as convenience cookies) and some cookies are used to create a pseudonymised usage profile (known as tracking cookies).  This website only uses functional and tracking cookies.
The functional cookies need to be processed to allow you to visit the website (see point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR).
Tracking cookies are used only if the website visitor has consented to this (point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR). The consent is given via the cookie banner which must be actively clicked on.
You can withdraw your consent to the data processing indicated using the cookies and tracking tools listed in section ‘C’ at any time with future effect by clicking the link below and changing your current preferences in our cookie consent manager:

For more information about our cookies, please see the
Cookie Policy
and the information below.
II. Adobe Analytics
This website uses the web analysis service Adobe Analytics to analyse user visits to this website. Data is processed on the basis of the consent that you have granted (point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR).
For the purposes of this analysis, cookies are stored on your device and used to collect information that is stored on the servers of our data processor, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (‘Adobe’). We cannot preclude the possibility that the information will be accessed by Adobe Systems Incorporated with headquarters in the USA. Corresponding EU standard contractual clauses for the transmission of personal data to processors in third countries were concluded to ensure sufficient protection of your personal data. You can download the EU standard contractual clauses from the URL
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087

.
The information stored on the Adobe servers cannot be directly traced to an individual because Adobe Analytics is used with the following settings: ‘Before Geo-Lookup: Replace visitor’s last IP octet with 0’ and ‘Obfuscate IP-Removed’. The setting ‘Before Geo-Lookup: Replace visitor’s last IP octet with 0’ causes the IP address to be anonymised prior to geo-location by substituting the last octet in the IP address with zeros. For statistical analysis, the user's approximate location is added to the tracking package, which still contains the complete IP address. Before the tracking package is saved, the IP address is then replaced by a single, permanent IP address – referred to as a generic IP address – when the setting ‘Obfuscate IP-Removed’ is configured. This removes the IP address from the data record that is stored.
D. Your rights
You may exercise the following rights vis-à-vis
Volkswagen
AG at any time free of charge. Additional information on exercising your rights can be found under Section E.
Right to information
You have the right to receive information from us (Article 15 GDPR) regarding the processing of your personal data.
Right to rectification
You have the right to request that we rectify (Article 16 GDPR) any of your personal data that is incorrect or incomplete.
Right to erasure
You have the right, in the event that the requirements specified in Article 17 GDPR have been met, to request the erasure of your data. Accordingly, you may request the erasure of your data, for instance, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Furthermore, you can also request erasure if we process your data on the basis of your consent and you revoke this consent.
Right to restrict processing
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data if the requirements specified under Article 18 GDPR have been met. This is the case, for example, if you dispute the accuracy of your data. You may then request that processing be restricted for as long as it takes to verify the accuracy of your data.
Right to data portability
Provided that the data processing is based on consent or on the fulfilment of a contract and that it is also carried out using automated processing, you have the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to forward it to another data processor.
Right to object
Insofar as the processing is based on an overriding legitimate interest, you have the right to object to the processing of your data. An objection is permissible if the processing either is carried out in the public interest or owing to a legitimate interest of
Volkswagen
AG or of a third party. If you wish to object, please notify us of your reasons for objecting to data processing. Besides this, you also have the right to object to data processing for the purpose of direct marketing. The same applies to profiling, if this is related to direct marketing.
Right to withdraw consent
Insofar as the data processing is undertaken based upon consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, with future effect at any time, free of charge.
Right to lodge a complaint
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g.: with the State Data Protection Officer for Lower Saxony) regarding our processing of your data.
