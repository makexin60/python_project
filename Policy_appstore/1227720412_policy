The confidentiality of your personal data is important to us. The Policy describes the methods we use to collect, store, process and use your personal data.
By providing us with such information and/or by using our website and/or applications, you consent to our collection, storage, processing and use of your personal data in accordance with applicable law and the terms of this Policy.
If you do not agree with the Policy, do not provide us with any personal data. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with the required personal data, we may be totally or partially unable to answer your requests and you may be unable to access parts of our website and/or applications.
If you have any questions or comments regarding this Policy, or comments to improve its quality, please write to us using the contact form.
Scope of application
This Policy applies to users of the website (smood.ch) and mobile/tablet applications in Switzerland, as well as the Smood Driver application and any other website or application developed by Smood SA, including any user of Smood's applications, functional websites or other services. By user, Smood includes in particular its Customers, its couriers, and its Partners (restaurant owners in particular) as well as its order pickers.
Collected Data
We collect diligently and in strict compliance with the laws certain personal data (e. g. your name, date of birth, gender, language preferences, password hash, post address, delivery details (door access code, floor, etc.), email address, phone number, order history, product and restaurant preferences, information on your client account, third-party social network identifiers, and communications with you).
Furthermore, we may also collect and use data regarding your use of and your behavior on our website or our applications including session data, your browsing preferences, statistics about your visits, information about the device used to access our services, such as model, IP address or other unique identifier, operating system and version, software, display language, device movement data, and mobile network data.
By voluntarily submitting personal data to us, you agree to provide us with true, current and complete data at the time of submission. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your personal data and shall inform us of any amendment thereto. We shall bear no liability for the consequences of inaccurate or untrue data.
Location data (customers): We collect precise and/or approximate location data from customers' mobile devices if they allow us to do so. Smood collects this data from the moment a user orders on the website or app until the order is completed, and when the app is open on the user's mobile device. This data is used to improve the Customer's use of the website and the application, including security features, but also to detect and prevent fraud.
Location data (couriers, restaurants, order pickers): We collect this data when the Smood Driver application or any other relevant websites or applications developed by Smood SA are running in the foreground (the application is open and appears on the screen) or in the background (the application is open but does not appear on the screen) on their mobile device. When couriers start a delivery service via the Smood app, their precise and/or approximate location data must be provided to Smood. The same is true for restaurant owners and order pickers. Once the application or website developed by Smood SA has received permission to access location-based services via the mobile device's authorization system we may also obtain the precise and/or approximate location of a user's cell phone when the application is running in the foreground or background. We collect the data you provide directly to us when you create or modify your account. The data that drivers provide directly when creating or modifying their account is collected by Smood. This data may include: lastname, firstname, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, date and place of birth, nationality, work permit status, identity card, passport, driving license, AVS card, photos, marital status and emergency contact details. This data can be shared with other drivers or order pickers, if required.
Internal messaging
Internal messaging allows couriers to communicate with Smood, other couriers, or delivery customers. These conversations are not private between your interlocutor and yourself: Smood can consult the history of your conversations at any time if necessary.
Internal messaging allows you to share photos taken from the application, as well as your precise and/or approximate location (at your request).
Use of Personal Data
As a general rule, your personal data will not be used for any other purposes than to answer your queries, to process your orders, to communicate with you, to optimize our products, our website and our applications, to verify your experience and/or to achieve any other purpose for which your personal data was provided to us.
Your personal data will only be passed on to third parties if this is necessary to process your orders or if you have given your prior consent. Personal data may also be shared with third parties when required by law or by a court order.
In case of fraudulent use of our website or applications, or upon suspicion of punishable accesses, the data may be analysed for purposes of clarification and transmitted to the competent official authorities or to the third person affected by the fraud.
Additional clauses relating to the “Grocery"
Smood is not part of the Migros community but undertakes to process the Cumulus numbers on behalf of Migros, according to the instructions of Migros and in compliance with the Swiss Data Protection Act. Neither Smood nor Migros sell your personal data to third parties under any circumstances and do not use the personal data for commercial purposes. Smood reserves the right to transmit this number to Migros Geneva in order to improve the customer experience. Learn more about the Cumulus program at
https://privacy.migros.ch/en.html

What Does Migros Do for Data Protection?
Migros values the trust of its customers. Data protection and data security are therefore central concerns for us. The responsible handling of personal data is also included in the Migros
Code of Conduct
, compliance with which is systematically ensured at Group level. In order to make it easier for customers to understand how we handle data at Migros, we make use of
Privacy Icons
.
What Data Is Processed About Me?
We process personal data for various reasons and for various purposes. Almost always when you interact with us or we interact with you, processing of your personal data is involved, for example when you contact our customer service. It is also important for us to be able to tailor our offering to your individual needs. Therefore, if you participate in our Cumulus bonus program, create a Migros Account, or register for one of our other services, we process transaction and behavior data and, based on this, make assumptions about your preferences. This enables us, for example, to send you Cumulus bonus coupons that are likely to be of interest to you.
How Do I Benefit From Data Processing by Migros?
Our data processing has many benefits for you. For example, it allows our customer service to address your individual needs and requirements. It also facilitates your shopping experience, for instance by making it easier for you to find those products online from our extensive range that you buy frequently or that are likely to be particularly relevant for you. Thanks to our data processing, you also benefit from an individualized shopping experience, for example by receiving offers and discounts that are tailored to your shopping habits. Thanks to the processing of personal data, you are also able to enjoy continuously more attractive product ranges and improved products and services.
To Whom Is My Personal Data Disclosed?
Your personal data may be shared with other companies of the Migros Group and used by them. Outside the Migros Group, they are generally only shared with selected service providers that process personal data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.
Is My Data Secure?
We ensure that your data is protected in a manner commensurate with the risks involved and take comprehensive security measures in order to protect your personal data against unauthorized access. We continuously improve our security measures and adapt them to the current state of the art.
What Has Changed Since the Last Version?
The current version of the Privacy Notice takes account of current legal requirements and makes it even easier for you to find out about data processing by the Migros Group. The changes relate to the following areas in particular:
Data processing in connection with camera systems and sensor technologies is now explained in a separate section (
section 11
).
A new section explains how we use artificial intelligence and similar new technologies (
section 14
).
We have specified the circumstances under which personal data may be passed on to companies outside the Migros Group (
section 8.2
).
Who Can I Contact if I Have Questions?
If you have questions about our processing of your personal data, you can contact the M-Infoline:

1. What Is This Privacy Notice About?
The protection of personal data is a matter of trust, and your trust is important to us. In this Privacy Notice, we inform you how and why we collect, process, and use your personal data.
In this Privacy Notice, you will learn, among other things:
what personal data we collect and process;
the purposes for which we use your personal data;
who has access to your personal data;
what benefits our data processing has for you;
for how long we process your personal data;
what rights you have with respect to your personal data; and
how you can contact us.
We have based this Privacy Notice on both the Swiss Data Protection Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR has established itself globally as a standard for strong data protection. However, whether and to what extent the GDPR applies depends on each individual case.
2. Who Is Responsible for Data Processing?
According to data protection law, responsibility for data processing lies with the company that determines whether such processing is to take place, for what purposes it is to take place and how it is to be configured. In general, a company of the Migros Group (“we” or “us”) is responsible for data processing under data protection law in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Generally, it will be the company that has referred you to this Privacy Notice.
In many cases, the Federation of Migros Cooperatives, Limmatstrasse 152, 8005 Zurich (CHE-105.829.940) is responsible for data processing. The Federation of Migros Cooperatives coordinates the activities of Migros and defines its strategy. For example, the Federation of Migros Cooperatives is responsible for data processing in connection with the Cumulus bonus program and the Migros Account.
The regional Migros Cooperatives, which independently operate the Migros supermarkets, specialty stores, leisure facilities, gastronomy outlets, and other formats of cooperative retailing under the Migros brand, are affiliated to the Federation of Migros Cooperatives. If you contact a regional Migros Cooperative directly (e.g. when contacting our customer service or visiting a Migros store), it is generally this Cooperative that is responsible for the associated data processing. In this case, any data protection provisions of the regional Cooperative concerned must also be complied with alongside this Privacy Notice.
Regional Migros Cooperatives:
Genossenschaft Migros Aare
Société Coopérative Migros Genève
Société coopérative Migros Neuchâtel-Fribourg
Società Cooperativa fra produttori e consumatori Migros – Ticino
Société coopérative Migros Valais
Genossenschaft Migros Basel
Genossenschaft Migros Luzern
Genossenschaft Migros Ostschweiz
Société Coopérative Migros Vaud

4. Which Personal Data Do We Process?
«Personal data» constitute information that can be associated with a specific person. In contrast, information that does not allow conclusions to be drawn about specific persons, such as aggregated data or statistical analysis, is not personal data.
We process various categories of such personal data. The key categories are set out below for your orientation. However, we may also process other personal data in individual cases.
You can find out more about the origin of the personal data processed by us in
section 5
and about the purposes for which we process these personal data in
section 6
.
4.1 Master Data
Master data comprise the fundamental data about you, such as title, name, contact details, or date of birth. We collect master data in particular if you register for one of our services (e.g. the Cumulus bonus program) or create a customer account (e.g. a Migros Account). We also collect master data if, for example, you take part in a competition or prize draw, register for a newsletter, or become a member of a Migros Cooperative. Moreover, we collect master data for access controls to our events or office premises. We additionally collect master data about contacts and representatives of contractual partners, organizations, and authorities.
Examples of master data include:

username and profile picture;
details on the use of online offers (e.g. Famigros, Migusto) and subscriptions (e.g. Migros Magazine);
details of associated websites, social media profiles, etc.;

Under certain circumstances, you can also register for individual online offers via the login of a third-party provider (e.g. Apple or Google). In this case, we receive access to certain data saved with the provider in question, for example your username, profile picture, date of birth, gender, and other information, the scope of which you can normally determine. Information in this regard can be found in the Privacy Notice of the provider concerned.
4.2	Contract Data
Contract data are personal data accrued in connection with the conclusion or processing of a contract, e.g. information on the conclusion of the contract, acquired claims and receivables, or information about customer satisfaction. We primarily conclude contracts with customers, business partners, and job applicants, but also with other contractual partners such as grant applicants. If on the basis of a contract you make use of our offers, e.g. by purchasing goods or procuring services, we often also collect transaction and behavior data (see
section 4.4
).
Contract data include details:
about the initiation and conclusion of contracts, e.g. date of contract conclusion, details from the application process, and details of the contract in question (e.g. type and duration);
about the processing and administration of contracts (e.g. contact details, delivery addresses, successful or unsuccessful deliveries, and information about payment methods);
in connection with our customer service and support with technical issues;
about our interactions with you (where applicable, a history with corresponding entries);
about receivables and acquired claims and benefits (e.g. Cumulus points balance and acquired premiums);
about defects and complaints as well as contract amendments;
about customer satisfaction that we may collect via surveys;
about financial matters such as to establish creditworthiness (i.e. information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the likelihood that receivables will be settled), about reminders, about collection proceedings, and about the enforcement of claims;
in connection with a job application, such as curriculum vitae, references, qualifications, certificates, meeting notes, etc. (that may also contain personal data of third parties);
in connection with a grant application, e.g. details about your project and other parties involved;
about interactions with you as the point of contact or representative of a business partner;
in connection with security and other checks with regard to entering into a business relationship.
4.3	Communication Data
If you contact us or we contact you, for example when you contact a customer service, or when you write to us, or call us, we process the exchanged communication contents and information about the type, time, and place of communication. In certain situations, we may also ask you to provide proof of identity.
Examples of communication data are:
name and contact details such as postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number;
content of e-mails, written correspondence, chat messages, social media posts, comments on a website, telephone conversations, video conferences, etc.;
responses to customer and satisfaction surveys;
details of the type, time, and in certain circumstances place of communication;
proofs of identity such as copies of official IDs;
marginal communication data.
Telephone conversations and video conferences with us may be recorded; we will inform you of this at the start of each conversation. If you do not want us to record such conversations, you may terminate the conversation at any time and contact us in another manner (e.g. by e-mail).
4.4	Transaction and Behavior Data
When you shop with us, make use of our offers and infrastructure, or procure our services, we frequently collect data about this usage and generally about your behavior. This is the case, for example, if you purchase something from us disclosing your Cumulus number or in an online shop, or if you use our websites and apps. If you participate in the Cumulus bonus program, these personal data may not only concern you but also other Cumulus participants, such as your family members.
Examples of transaction and behavior data include the following information if available to us as personal data:
Details about your shopping behavior (e.g. where, how often, what, and at what prices you shop, as well as the method of payment and selected type of delivery);
Details about your behavior in online shops (ordered and canceled shopping baskets, wish lists, viewed articles, search items and results, ratings and comments submitted, etc.);
Details about the attendance of events and use of leisure offers (e.g. date, place, and type of event or use);
Details about participation in competitions, prize draws, and similar events;
Details about your behavior on websites;
Details about the installation and use of mobile apps;
Details about your use of electronic messages (e.g. whether and when you opened an e-mail or clicked on a link);
Details about your use of our Wi-Fi networks (e.g. date, time, and duration of connection, location of the Wi-Fi network, and data volume).
You can also use many of our offers anonymously. For example, you can shop in our stores without disclosing your Cumulus number. It is frequently also possible to use our online facilities without an account. However, if you do have an account, transaction and behavior data may also be assigned to your profile even if you are not logged in at the time you visit the website or make use of the app.
4.5	Preference Data
We wish to tailor our offers and services to our customers as effectively as possible. We therefore also process data about your interests and preferences. To do so, we may combine transaction and behavior data with other data and analyze such data on a personal and non-personal basis. This enables us to draw conclusions about characteristics, preferences, and likely behavior, such as your preferences and affinities regarding specific products and services.
In particular, we may create segments (permanently or case-related), that is, groups of persons displaying similarities with regard to specific characteristics. Preference data may be used either personally (e.g. in order to show you advertising that is of interest to you or send you relevant bonus coupons) or on a non-personal basis (e.g. for market research or product development purposes).
You can find further information about profiling in this respect in
section 12
.
4.6	Technical Data
When you make use of our websites, apps, Wi-Fi networks, or other electronic services, we collect certain technical data such as your IP address or device ID. Technical data also include the protocols in which we record the use of our systems (log files). In some cases, we may also assign a unique code number (an ID) to your end device (tablet, PC, smartphone, etc.), for example by using cookies or similar technologies, in order to be able to recognize it. Further details concerning this can be found in our
Cookie Notice
.
Technical data can in particular also be used to collect behavior data, that is, details about your use of websites and mobile apps (see
section 4.4
). However, we are usually unable to derive who you are from technical data unless you create a customer account or register, for example. In this case, we can link technical data with master data, and thus with your person.
Technical data include:
the IP address of your device and further device IDs (e.g. MAC address);
code numbers assigned to your device by cookies and similar technologies (e.g. pixel tags);
details of your device and its configuration, such as operating system and language settings;
details about the browser with which you access the offer, and its configuration;
information about your movements and actions on our websites and in our apps;
details about your Internet provider;
your approximate location and the time of use;
system recordings of accesses and other events (log files).
These technical data alone generally do not allow us to draw any conclusions about your identity. However, in combination with user accounts, registrations, the processing of contracts, or analyses of preference data, they can be linked with other data categories and therefore potentially also with your person.
Concerning the processing of technical data, please also consult our
Cookie Notice
.
4.7	Image and Sound Recordings
We regularly produce photos, videos, and sound recordings in which you might be featured, for example if you attend an event, contact our customer service, or receive advice by video conference. We also make recordings in connection with video surveillance in our stores and other premises.
Examples of image and sound recordings include:
Recordings from  camera systems and sensors in our stores and other premises;
photos, videos, and sound recordings of customer and public events (e.g. advertising, sponsorship, cultural events, and sports events);
photos, videos, and sound recordings of courses, presentations, training courses, etc.;
recordings of telephone conversations and video conferences (e.g. in customer service or advice to customers).
5. Where Do the Personal Data Come From?
5.1	Provided Data
You often disclose personal data to us yourself, for instance when sending us data or communicating with us. Master, contract, and communication data in particular are generally something you disclose to us yourself. You are in many cases also responsible for disclosing preference data to us.
For example, you provide us with personal data yourself in the following cases:
You create a Migros Account or register for the Cumulus bonus program;
You create a user account in an online shop or other online offer;
You take part in a prize draw or competition;
You take out a fitness subscription at one of our fitness parks;
You register for a Migros Club School course;
You contact M-Infoline or another customer service unit;
You register for Migusto and enter your eating habits and cooking preferences.
The provision of personal data is largely voluntary, which means that you are not generally obliged to disclose your personal data to us. However, we do have to collect and process the personal data that are required for processing contractual relationships and fulfilling associated obligations or that are prescribed by law, such as mandatory master and contract data, as we would otherwise be unable to conclude or continue the contract in question.
If you send us data about other persons (e.g. family members), we assume that you are authorized to do so and that these data are correct. Please also ensure that these other persons have been informed about this Privacy Notice.
5.2	Collected Data
We may also collect personal data about you ourselves or automatically, such as when you shop with us, make use of our offers, or procure our services. Such data frequently comprise transaction and behavior data and technical data.
For example, we independently collect personal data about you in the following cases:
You shop in one of our stores or at one of our collecting partners and in doing so make use of your Cumulus card and/or its corresponding code;
You order a product in one of our online shops;
You make use of self-scanning or self-checkout facilities and when shopping in one of our stores scan products yourself with a hand scanner, at the scanning station, or with your smartphone;
You visit one of our websites (e.g. www.migros.ch) or use one of our apps (e.g. the Migros App);
You click on a link in one of our newsletters or interact with one of our electronic promotional materials in another way.
We may also derive personal data from personal data already available to us, for example by analyzing transaction and behavior data. Such derived personal data frequently comprise preference data.
For example, we can analyze the transaction and behavior data collected during purchases in our stores and online shops and, on this basis, make assumptions about your personal interests, preferences, affinities, and habits. This enables us, for instance, to tailor our offers and information to your individual needs and interests. For example, this enables us to send you an individual selection of bonus coupons relevant for you as part of the Cumulus bonus program. You can find further information about transaction and behavior data in
section 4.4
, and about profiling in this context in
section 12
.
5.3 Received Data
We may also receive personal data from other companies of the Migros Group. Further information about this can be found in
section 8
. Moreover, we may also receive information about you from other third parties, such as from companies with which we cooperate, persons who communicate with us, or public sources.
For example, we may receive information about you from the following third parties:
Cooperation partners, e.g. partners of the Cumulus bonus program such as collecting or redemption partners;
Your employer and work colleagues in connection with a job application and professional functions;
Third parties if correspondence and discussions concern you;
Persons close to you (family members, legal representatives, etc.), e.g. your address for deliveries, references, or powers of attorney;

Swiss Post and address dealers, e.g. for address updates;

6.1 Communication
We wish to remain in contact with you and address your individual requirements. We therefore process personal data for the communication with you, in order to answer inquiries and for customer care, for instance. In particular, we make use of communication and master data for this, as well as contract data if the communication concerns a contract.

Messages and offers may also be personalized in order to – as far as possible – only send you information that is likely to be of interest to you. For this purpose, we in particular make use of master data, contract data, communication data, transaction data, behavior data, preference data, and technical data, but also image and sound recordings.

The personalization of our messages enables us to tailor information to your individual needs and interests, and to only present you with offers that are likely to be relevant for you. For example, within the scope of the Cumulus bonus program we send you an individual selection of bonus coupons that are relevant for you or show you online contents tailored to you. You can find further information about this profiling in
section 12
.
6.4	Market Research and Product Development

To do so, we particularly process master, behavior, transaction, preference data, and image and sound recordings, as well as communication data and information from customer surveys, other surveys and studies, and further information, for example from the media, the Internet, and other public sources. As far as possible, we make use of pseudonymized or anonymized information for these purposes.

6.6	Compliance With Statutory Requirements
We wish to lay the foundations for compliance with statutory requirements. We therefore also process personal data in order to comply with legal obligations and to prevent and detect infringements. Examples of this include receiving and processing complaints and other messages, complying with court and administrative orders, and measures for detecting and investigating misuse.

All such cases may concern Swiss law or foreign regulations to which we are subject, as well as self-regulations, industry and other standards, our own corporate governance, or official directives.
6.7	Protection of Rights
We wish to be able to enforce our claims defend ourselves against the claims of others. We therefore also process personal data for the protection of rights, for instance in order to enforce claims judicially, before or out of court, and before authorities in Switzerland and abroad, or to defend ourselves against claims. Depending on the situation, we process different categories of personal data, such as contact data and details of events that have led to or could lead to a dispute.

We wish to shape our internal processes efficiently. We therefore process personal data for administration within the Group. We particularly process master data, contract data, and technical data, as well as transaction data, behavior data, and communication data.
Administration within the Group particularly includes

We may therefore also disclose personal data to other companies of the Migros Group in order to support their own processing purposes in accordance with this Privacy Notice in the overall interest of the Migros Group. Further information about this can be found in
section 8
.
7. What Is the Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data?

doing so is required for compliance with Swiss and foreign legal obligations.
In particular, we have a legitimate interest in processing for the purposes set out in

8. To Whom Do We Disclose Personal Data?

We may disclose personal data that we receive from you or third-party sources to other Migros Group companies. Disclosure may serve to facilitate intra-Group administration or support of the group companies concerned and their own processing purposes
(section 6)
, such as when we support customer service, the personalization of marketing activities, the development and improvement of products and services, the conducting of credit assessments, or endeavors to prevent theft, fraud, and misuse. The personal data received may also be matched and linked to existing personal data by the relevant group companies.
For example, this may include the following disclosures of data:
All personal data categories listed in
section 4
for the administration and processing of contractual relationships, especially in connection with products and services involving multiple Group companies;
Master data, contract data, communication data, transaction and behavior data, and preference data, as well as findings from customer and other surveys, studies, and image and sound recordings for market research and product development purposes if personalization of such data is necessary;

Data are also disclosed to other Group companies, for example, so that you can make use of your Migros Account as a central user account for multiple digital Migros services without having to re-register. If you participate in the Cumulus bonus program and use the Migros online shop, we also disclose data such as behavior, transaction, and preference data in connection with your store purchases to Migros Online SA so that you are shown those products and offers in the Migros online shop that you frequently purchase or that are likely to be particularly relevant for you.
Section 2
contains more information on the companies belonging to the Migros Group.
8.2	Outside the Migros Group
We may disclose your personal data to companies outside the Migros Group if we make use of their services. These service providers generally process personal data on our behalf as so-called “contract processors”. Our contract processors are obliged to only process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to take suitable measures to ensure data security. Certain service providers are also responsible jointly with us or independently (e.g. collection agencies, credit agencies, consulting companies). We ensure through the selection of service providers and suitable contractual agreements that data protection is upheld during the entire processing of your personal data.
Examples include services in the following areas:
Shipping and logistics, for example for the delivery of ordered goods;
Advertising and marketing services, for example for the delivery of messages and information;
Corporate management services, for example accounting or asset management;
Payment services;
Credit information services, e.g. to decide whether we can offer a purchase on account;
Collection services, e.g. for the reminder of outstanding receivables and their enforcement;
IT services, for example in the areas of data storage (hosting), cloud services, the delivery of e-mail newsletters, and data analysis and refinement;
Advisory services, for example the services of tax advisers, lawyers, management consultants, or advisers in the field of personnel recruitment and placement.
We may also disclose personal data to third parties for their own purposes, for example if you have granted us your consent to do so, if we are legally obliged or authorized to share such information, or if we have overriding interests in disclosing it. In such cases, the data recipient is legally responsible as the controller of the data.
Examples of such cases include the following:
The transfer of claims to other companies, such as collection agencies;
the disclosure of information on payment behavior to credit agencies that carry out credit checks for us and other customers or provide credit information;
the use of personal data for the development of products and the training of models and algorithms by technology providers whose IT solutions we use;
the disclosure of personal data for scientific research, study purposes and as part of hackathons and similar events for idea development;
the review or execution of corporate transactions such as corporate acquisitions, sales, and mergers.
the disclosure of personal data to courts and authorities within Switzerland and abroad, such as criminal prosecution authorities in case of suspected criminal activities.
the processing of personal data in order to comply with a court or administrative order, or to enforce or defend legal rights or claims, or if we consider such processing to be necessary on any other legal grounds. We may also disclose your personal data to other parties involved in any proceedings.
We may also pass on statistical evaluations to third parties. This is non-personal information that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about a specific person. For example, we can use transaction data to evaluate in which customer segments a certain product is particularly popular and make this evaluation available to the supplier of the relevant product in question.
Please take note of our
Cookie Notice
concerning independent data collection by third-party providers whose tools we have integrated into our websites and apps.
Unless a special form of professional secrecy applies in individual cases (e.g. banking, pharmaceutical, or medical confidentiality), we are not subject to any professional confidentiality. Please inform us in individual cases if you believe that specific personal data are subject to a duty of confidentiality so that we can review your concerns.
9. How Do We Disclose Personal Data Abroad?
We process and store personal data mostly in Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA). In certain cases, however, we may also disclose personal data to service providers and other recipients (see
section 8
) who are located outside this area or who process personal data outside this area, in principle in any country in the world. The countries in question may not have laws that protect your personal data to the same extent as in Switzerland or the EEA. If we transfer your personal data to such a country, we will ensure the protection of your personal data in an appropriate manner.
One means of ensuring adequate data protection is, for example, to conclude data transfer agreements with the recipients of your personal data in third countries that ensure the required level of data protection. This includes agreements that have been approved, issued, or recognized by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, known as standard contractual clauses. An example of the data transfer agreements generally used by us can be found
here
. Please note that such contractual arrangements can partially compensate for weaker or missing statutory protection but cannot rule out all risks completely (e.g. government access abroad). Data may also be transferred to countries without adequate protection in exceptional cases, for example if consent is granted, in connection with legal proceedings abroad, or if transfer is necessary for the processing of an agreement.
10. How Do We Process Sensitive Personal Data?
Certain types of personal data are considered under data protection law to be sensitive, such as details about health and biometric features. Depending on the circumstances, the categories of personal data listed in
section 4
may also comprise such sensitive personal data. However, we generally only process sensitive personal data if this is necessary for the provision of a service, if you have voluntarily disclosed these data to us, or have consented to such processing. We may also process sensitive personal data if this is necessary for the protection of rights or compliance with Swiss or foreign legal provisions, if the data concerned have clearly been publicly disclosed by the person in question, or if the applicable law otherwise permits its processing.
For example, we may process sensitive personal data in the following cases:
You register for Migusto and provide details about allergies and intolerances;
You make use of iMpuls Coach on our iMpuls health platform in order to achieve your individual health target;
You notify us of health complaints after the consumption, use, or application of a product;
You purchase a medical product covered by health insurance and request a reimbursement receipt;
You wish to purchase an alcoholic beverage in an online shop and supply digital proof of age;
You train in a fitness park and obtain advice or make use of an intelligent fitness device;
You book a holiday package and provide details of intolerances, allergies, or dietary requirements observed for religious reasons;
You conduct a foot analysis and obtain advice on suitable running shoes;
You apply for a vacancy and provide details about your state of health, about a union affiliation, or about criminal records and criminal law measures.
The personal data of children also require special protection. In general, we therefore do not process any personal data belonging to children. However, if such processing becomes necessary, we ensure that these data are afforded special protection. In addition, in cases in which we purposely process the personal data of children on the basis of consent, as a rule we obtain the consent of the children’s parents or legal representatives. If consent for a child is provided by their parents or legal representatives, the adult is free to withdraw this consent at a later time.
Examples of situations in which we may process the personal data of children include the following:
You organize a supervised children’s birthday party for your child at a Migros restaurant and provide us with the names of the children attending.
You make use of the childcare facilities at a shopping center and we record the name of your child and your contact details for this purpose.
You join the Famigros family club and enter the names and dates of birth of your children in order to receive Famigros benefits and birthday surprises.
11. How Do We Use Camera Systems and Sensor Technologies?
We regularly use camera systems as well as image and audio sensors in our stores and other premises and process the recordings made thereby, in particular image and video recordings (
section 4.7
). Their use is primarily intended for security and prevention purposes, such as the security of retail products and the protection of our customers, compliance with legal requirements and the protection of rights. We may also use camera systems and sensor technologies for market research and product development, as well as marketing purposes.
Generally, we do not know who the persons recorded are. However, if necessary for the respective purpose, we may establish a personal connection, e.g. if we wish to identify a person who has committed a criminal offense on our premises, such as theft or damage to property. We can also analyze recordings automatically and combine or compare the recordings with other data, e.g. with data from cash register systems or data from the Cumulus bonus program.
The way in which camera systems and sensor technologies are used, the specific technologies applied and the purposes pursued vary depending on the store setting. In unstaffed settings, for example, more processing is required than in staffed settings. We can use camera systems and sensor technologies in the following ways, for example:
to detect violations of house rules and criminal acts (e.g. theft, damage to property or bodily harm), to identify the offenders and for evidentiary purposes and to enforce bans, whereby we can also automatically analyze recordings and link or compare them with other data;
to automatically search for a specified combination of characteristics (such as clothing or body size) in existing video recordings from a specific time period and thus be able to evaluate recordings in a targeted manner in a specific case of a suspected incident and increase the likelihood of solving criminal acts;
to detect dangerous situations and incidents and automatically trigger alarms in such cases (e.g. if a person in an unstaffed setting does not move for a longer period of time);
to record the removed goods and settle purchases in autonomous formats without checkout staff
to record the number of people in the retail spaces and their location, e.g. to control customer flows, optimize checkout staffing and implement health and safety principles;
to analyze routes taken and amounts of time spent, e.g. to gain a better understanding of how our points of sale are used and how we can improve our store concepts;
to draw conclusions about certain characteristics (such as gender or age) based on physical appearance and to display target-group-specific messages on digital advertising spaces without us knowing the person’s identity;
to record vehicle license plates in barrier-free parking systems, to calculate parking stay times and to enforce compliance with the parking regulations.
If a point of sale is operated by a franchise partner, the partner concerned may be responsible for the data processing related to the use of camera systems or sensor technologies instead of us or jointly with us.
12. How Do We Conduct Profiling?
«Profiling» refers to a procedure during which personal data is processed on an automated basis in order to analyze personal aspects or make predictions, e.g. the analysis of personal interests, preferences, affinities, and habits or the prediction of likely behavior. Profiling can particularly be used to derive preference data (further details about this can be found in
section 4.5
).
Profiling is a common procedure, e.g. it occurs in the context of automated processing
of master, contract, transaction and behavior data for purchases in our stores and online shops;
of transaction and behavior data, as well as technical data in connection with our websites and apps;
of information in connection with the attendance of events, use of leisure offers, and participation in competitions, prize draws, and similar events;
of communication data, such as your response to advertising and other messages;
of other transaction and behavior data.
Profiling helps us to
improve our offers on a continuous basis and tailor them to individual needs;
present our contents and offers to you in accordance with your needs;
to the extent possible only show you advertisements and offers that are likely to be relevant for you;
support you better with our customer service;
decide on the basis of a credit assessment which payment options are available.
We conduct profiling, for example, in connection with the
Cumulus bonus program
by analyzing your shopping behavior and assigning you to specific customer segments on this basis. Customer segments are groups of persons displaying similarities with regard to specific characteristics. Such customer segments may be created permanently or on a case-related basis and may relate, for example, to a stage of life or purchase motive. For example, this profiling allows us to provide you with an individual selection of bonus coupons that are relevant to you. If, for instance, you frequently purchase sustainable products from us, you will receive more coupons and offers for Migros Bio and other sustainable products. We can also make you aware of specific offers at your usual store if we know your preferred store. Or we can avoid instances in which you receive coupons for meat products if we can assume that you are vegetarian.
Profiling also takes place in connection with a
Migros Account
, for instance when we analyze your usage and shopping behavior in our online shops and on our websites and apps in order to offer you an individual user experience and send you offers tailored to your interests and preferences.
In order to improve the quality of our analyses and predictions, we may also combine personal data that originate from different sources as the basis of our profiling, for example data collected offline and online, as well as data that have been collected via our different services or that we have received from other Migros Group companies.
If you do not want us to analyze personal aspects or make predictions, you can opt against participation in the Cumulus bonus program or make your purchases without using the Cumulus card. You can also refrain from creating a Migros Account and registering for one of our other services. In certain cases, you also have the right to object to profiling as described in
section 17
.
13. Do We Use Automated Individual Decision-Making?
«Automated individual decision-making» refers to any decision that is made on a fully automated basis, meaning with no relevant human influences, and has legal consequences for the person concerned or that significantly affects him or her in some other way. We generally do not do this but will inform you separately should we opt to utilize automated individual decision-making in individual cases. You will then have the option of having the decision reviewed by a human being if you do not agree with it.
14. How Do We Use Artificial Intelligence?
New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, have great potential, but also present challenges. We ensure that we always use these new technologies in line with our values and carefully weigh the opportunities and risks on a case-by-case basis. We take responsibility for the content generated or decisions made for us by artificial intelligence, and in the case of decisions with significant implications for the affected person, we ensure that it can be reviewed by a human (see
section 12
). If any artificial intelligence we use interacts directly with you, we will let you know.
We may use artificial intelligence, for example, to improve our products and services, to make our internal processes more efficient, to increase security and prevent misuse or for any of the other purposes set out in
section 6
. Artificial intelligence applications can process personal data, but this is not always the case. Possible areas of application for artificial intelligence include:
the creation of information about our products and services and making it more accessible, such as automated summaries of product reviews on the Migipedia community platform;
personalization of the shopping experience, such as a selection of Cumulus bonus coupons tailored to individual needs and interests;
creation of versatile images (stock images), product texts, product packaging and similar non-personal content;
the needs-based handling of customer queries and the automated evaluation of customer feedback;
generally improving the experience for customers when they use our offers and services, e.g. by providing specific advice and information relevant to the target group;
processing related to the use of video cameras and sensor technologies, such as automated analysis and evaluation of the recordings made (see
section 11
);
support with the creation of program code.
15. How Do We Protect Personal Data?
We take appropriate technical and organizational security measures in order to safeguard your personal data, protect you against unauthorized or unlawful processing activities, and to address the risk of loss, unintentional changes, inadvertent disclosure, or unauthorized access. However, like all companies, we cannot completely rule out data security infringements; certain residual risks are unavoidable.
Security risks of a technical nature include the encryption and pseudonymization of data, record keeping, access restrictions, and the storage of data backups. Security measures of an organizational nature include instructions issued to our employees, confidentiality agreements, and audits. We also require our contract processors to take appropriate technical and organizational security measures.
16. For How Long Do We Process Personal Data?
We process and store your personal data
for as long as it is required for the purpose of processing and compatible purposes, in the case of contracts normally for at least the duration of the contractual relationship;
for as long as we have a legitimate interest in storing it. This may be the case, in particular, if we need personal data to enforce or defend claims, for archiving purposes, and to ensure IT security;
for as long as it is subject to a statutory retention requirement. For example, a ten-year retention period applies to certain data. Shorter retention periods apply for other data, for example for recordings from video surveillance or for recordings of certain online processes (log data).
In certain cases, we will also ask for your consent if we want to store your personal data for longer periods (e.g. for job applications that we wish to keep on file). At the end of the periods specified, we will erase or anonymize your personal data.
For example, we adhere to the following retention periods, although we may deviate from them in individual cases:
Cumulus bonus program
: Transaction data (purchase data) is retained for a maximum of ten years. The master and contact data and the Cumulus number are deleted or anonymized after a period of inactivity of two years. These data are also deleted or anonymized in the event of cancellation of Cumulus membership or a deletion request.
Migros Account
: Personal data are stored for the duration that the account is active. In the event of a request to delete the account, the data are deleted within 30 days. If the account is deactivated (e.g. in the case of inactivity or blocking due to misuse), the data are deleted over a period not exceeding 24 months.
Contracts
: We generally retain master and contract data for ten years as of the last contractual activity or contract expiry. However, this period may be longer if this is necessary for the provision of evidence, due to statutory or contractual provisions, or for technical reasons. Transaction data in connection with contracts are generally retained for ten years.
Technical data
: We generally retain log files for six months. The storage period of cookies is normally between a few days and two years unless they are immediately deleted at the end of the session.
Communication data
: E-mails, messages via the contact form and written correspondence are generally retained for ten years.
Image and sound recordings
: The retention period varies depending on the purpose. It can range from a few days in the case of video surveillance recordings to several years in the case of reports about events with pictures.
Cooperative members
: Data on cooperative members are retained in accordance with corporate requirements, generally for at least the duration of the membership.
Job applications
: We generally delete application data within six months following conclusion of the application process. We may keep your application on file with your consent with a view to potential recruitment at a later stage.
17. What Rights Do You Have?
You have the right to object to data processing particularly if we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest and the other applicable requirements are met. You can also object to data processing in connection with direct advertising (e.g. advertising e-mails) at any time. This also applies to profiling, to the extent it is related to direct advertising.
Provided the applicable conditions are met and there are no applicable statutory exceptions, you also have the following rights:
the right to request information about your personal data stored by us;
the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data corrected;
the right to request the deletion or anonymization of your personal data;
the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted;
the right to receive certain personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
the right to revoke consent with effect for the future, insofar as processing is based on consent.
Please note that these rights may be restricted or excluded in individual cases, e.g. if there are doubts about the identity or if this is necessary to protect other persons, to safeguard interests worthy of protection or to comply with legal obligations.
Via our
web form
, you can exercise the most important of the above-mentioned rights regarding particular types of data processing by the companies indicated therein. You can also deactivate the receipt of specific offers and information at any time in your
Migros Account

Cookie Notice
What Is It About?
This Cookie Notice describes how and why we collect, process, and utilize personal and other data when you make use of our websites and mobile apps – particularly in connection with cookies and similar technologies. For the sake of simplicity, in the following we will generically refer to websites, but in doing so also include mobile apps.
Further information about our handling of personal data can be found in our
Privacy Notice
.
Who Is Responsible for Data Processing?
A Migros Group company is fundamentally responsible under data protection law in each case for the processing of personal data in accordance with this Cookie Notice (“
we
” or “
us
”). This is normally the company that has alerted you to this Cookie Notice. Should you have any questions about this Cookie Notice or the processing of your personal data, please contact the responsible company. You are also welcome to contact us as follows:

What Are Log Files?
Each time our websites are used, certain data are automatically accumulated for technical reasons and temporarily stored in so-called log files. Examples include the following technical data:
IP address of the requesting end device,
Information about your Internet service provider,
Information about the operating system of your end device (tablet, PC, smartphone, etc.),
Information about the referring URL,
Information about the browser used,
Date and time of access, and
Contents accessed when visiting the website.
These data are processed for the purpose of facilitating the use of our websites (connection establishment) and ensuring their smooth operation, guaranteeing system security and stability, facilitating the enhancement of our websites and for statistical purposes.
The IP address is also analyzed together with other log files and further data available to us, if applicable, in the event of attacks on IT infrastructure or other potential unlawful or improper use of the websites for solution and aversion purposes, and may be used during criminal proceedings for the identification of persons concerned and for action taken under civil and criminal law against these persons.
What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?
Cookies are files that your browser automatically stores on your end device when you visit our websites. Cookies contain a unique code number (ID) enabling us to distinguish individual visitors from others, but normally without identifying them. Depending on their intended use, cookies may contain further information, for example about visited sites and the duration of a visit to a site. We use both session cookies that are deleted again when the browser is closed, and permanent cookies that remain stored for a given period after the browser is closed (normally between a few days and two years) and serve to identify visitors again on subsequent visits.
We may also use similar technologies such as pixel tags, fingerprints and other technologies for storing data in the browser. Pixel tags are small, normally invisible images or a program code loaded by a server that provide the server operator with specific information such as whether and when a website was visited. Fingerprints comprise information collected during your website visit about the configuration of your end device or your browser that enables your end device to be distinguished from other devices. Most browsers also support further technologies for the storage of data in the browser that are similar to cookies and that we may also make use of (e.g. web storage).
How Can Cookies and Similar Technologies Be Deactivated?
In some cases, you have the option when accessing our websites to activate or deactivate certain categories of cookies via a button displayed in the browser. For the website www.migros.ch, you can find options to deactivate cookies
here
. You can also configure the settings in your browser in such a way as to block certain cookies or similar technologies or delete existing cookies and other data stored in the browser. You can also expand your browser with software (so-called “plug-ins”) to block tracking by specific third parties. You can find further information in the help pages of your browser (normally under the key word “data protection”). Please note that our websites may no longer function to their full extent if you block cookies and similar technologies.
What Types of Cookies and Similar Technologies Do We Use?
We use the following types of cookies and similar technologies:
Necessary cookies:
Necessary cookies are required for a website and its functions to be used. For example, these cookies ensure that you are able to navigate between pages without details entered in a form or products placed in a shopping basket being lost.
Performance cookies:
Performance cookies collect information about how a website is used and enable us to conduct analyses, for example to find out which pages are most popular and how visitors move around a website. These cookies serve to simplify and speed up website visits and generally to improve user-friendliness.
Functional cookies:
Functional cookies enable us to offer extended functions and display personalized contents. For example, these cookies allow us to store information already provided (such as language selection) or to display products to you based on those previously viewed that may also be of interest to you.
Marketing cookies:
Marketing cookies help us and our advertising partners to approach you on our own and third-party websites with advertisements for products or services that may be of interest to you or to display our advertisements to you during further Internet usage after visiting our websites.
How Do We Make Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies of Third Parties?
The cookies and/or similar technologies used by us may originate from us or from third-party companies, for instance if we make use of functions provided by third parties. Such third-party providers may be located outside Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA) as long as the protection of your personal data is adequately safeguarded.
For example, we make use of analysis services to analyze how you use our websites in order to optimize and personalize them. Cookies and similar technologies of third-party providers furthermore enable them to approach you on our websites or on other websites and in social networks that also collaborate with these third parties with individualized advertising and to measure how effective advertisements are (e.g. whether you arrive at our website via an advertisement and what actions you then carry out on our website).
Third-party providers may to this end record use of the website in question. These recordings may be combined by such providers with similar information from other websites. The behavior of certain users can thus be recorded across multiple websites and end devices. The applicable provider may in many cases also make use of these data for its own purposes, such as for personalized advertising on its own websites and on other websites that it supplies with advertising. If users are registered with the provider, the provider may assign the usage data to the person in question. The processing of such personal data is carried out here by the provider in its own responsibility and in accordance with its own data protection provisions.
Two of the most important third-party providers are Google and Meta. Further details concerning them can be found below. Other third-party providers generally process personal and other data in a similar manner.
Google Analytics and Google Firebase
On many of our websites, we make use of
Google Analytics
, an analysis service of Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA) and Google Ireland Ltd (Google Building Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; both referred to jointly as “Google”, whereby Google Ireland Ltd is responsible for the processing of personal data). Google makes use of cookies and similar technologies to collect specific information about the behavior of individual users on the applicable website and the end device used for this (tablet, PC, smartphone, etc.), such as how often you have opened our website, how many purchases have been made, or what interests you have, as well as data about the end device used by you, such as the operating system. Further information about this can be found at this
link
.
We have configured the service in such a way that the IP addresses of visitors of the websites of Google within Europe are shortened prior to forwarding to the USA and therefore cannot be traced back. Google supplies us with reports and in this respect can be considered our contract processor. However, Google also processes some data for its own purposes. Google may in some circumstances be able to draw conclusions on the basis of the collected data about the identity of visitors of the websites and thus create personal profiles and link the collected data with any existing Google accounts of these persons. Information about the data protection of Google Analytics can be found
here
, and if you have a Google account yourself you will find further information
here
.
Meta Custom Audiences
Our websites may also make use of
Meta Pixel
and similar technologies of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Block J, Serpentine Avenue, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Meta”). We make use of these technologies in order to display display the ads placed by us only to users on Meta's platforms (e.g. Instagram or Facebook) and at partners cooperating with Meta (so-called “
audience network
”) who have displayed an interest in us or whose features correspond to those that we communicate to Meta for this purpose (such as interests in specific topics or products that become evident from the websites visited; “custom audiences”). We can also monitor the effectiveness of ads via these technologies for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users are forwarded to our website after clicking on an ad (so-called “conversion measurement”). Further details concerning this can be found
here
.
We are jointly responsible with Meta for the exchange of data that Meta receives or collects via the Meta Pixel or comparable functions, for the display of advertising information corresponding to the interests of users, for the improvement of advertisement delivery, and for the personalization of functions and contents (but not for further processing). We have therefore concluded a
supplementary agreement
to this effect with Meta. Users may accordingly submit requests for information and other inquiries from data subjects in connection with this joint responsibility directly to Meta.
How Do We Make Use of Social Media Presences?
We may have our own presences on social networks and similar third-party platforms. If you communicate with us via such presences or comment on or disseminate contents we post, we will collect corresponding details and process them in accordance with our
Privacy Notice
. We are entitled but not obliged to review contents prior to or after their publication and to delete contents without notification where this is technically possible, or to report them to the provider of the platform in question. Where rules of decency and codes of conduct are violated, we may also notify the provider of the platform of the user account in question for blocking or deletion.
When visiting our social media presences, data (for example about your user behavior) may also be transmitted to or collected by the provider in question directly and processed together with other data already known to said provider (such as for marketing and market research purposes and the personalization of platform contents). Where we are jointly responsible with the provider for certain types of processing, we will conclude a corresponding agreement with such provider. You may obtain information about the material content of this agreement from the provider. Further information about data processing by the providers of social networks can be found in the data protection provisions of the corresponding social networks.
Changes to This Cookie Notice
This Cookie Notice may be updated over time, especially if we change our data processing activities or if new legal provisions become applicable. In general, the version of the Cookie Notice in effect at the time at which the data processing activity in question commences is applicable.

Depending on your settings, this browsing history is sent to Microsoft, which helps us find and fix problems and improve our products and services for all users. You can manage the collection of optional diagnostic data in the browser by selecting

Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostic data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports
. This includes data from testing new experiences. To finish making changes to this setting, restart Microsoft Edge.
Turning this setting on allows this optional diagnostic data to be shared with Microsoft from other applications using Microsoft Edge, such as a video streaming app that hosts the Microsoft Edge web platform to stream the video. The Microsoft Edge web platform will send info about how you use the web platform and sites you visit in the application to Microsoft.  This data collection is determined by your optional diagnostic data setting in Privacy, search, and services settings in Microsoft Edge.
On Windows 10, these settings are determined by your Windows diagnostic setting. To change your diagnostic data setting, select

As of
March 6th 2024,
Microsoft Edge diagnostic data is collected separately from Windows diagnostic data on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and newer) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and newer) devices in the European Economic Area. For these Windows versions, and on all other platforms, you can change your settings in Microsoft Edge by selecting

When you’re searching for something, Microsoft Edge can give suggestions about what you’re searching for. To turn on this feature, select

, and turn on
Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters
. As you start to type, the info you enter in the address bar is sent to your default search provider to give you immediate search and website suggestions.
When you use InPrivate browsing or guest mode, Microsoft Edge collects some info about how you use the browser depending on your Windows diagnostic data setting or Microsoft Edge privacy settings, but automatic suggestions are turned off and info about websites you visit is not collected. Microsoft Edge will delete your browsing history, cookies, and site data, as well as passwords, addresses, and form data when you close all InPrivate windows. You can start a new InPrivate session by selecting

Microsoft Edge also has features to help you and your content stay safe online. Windows Defender SmartScreen automatically blocks websites and content downloads that are reported to be malicious. Windows Defender SmartScreen checks the address of the webpage you're visiting against a list of webpage addresses stored on your device that Microsoft believes to be legitimate. Addresses that aren't on your device’s list and the addresses of files you're downloading will be sent to Microsoft and checked against a frequently updated list of webpages and downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious.
To speed up tedious tasks like filling out forms and entering passwords, Microsoft Edge can save info to help. If you choose to use those features, Microsoft Edge stores the info on your device. If you’ve turned on sync for form fill like addresses or passwords, this info will be sent to the Microsoft cloud and stored with your Microsoft account to be synced across all your signed-in versions of Microsoft Edge.

To integrate your browsing experience with other activities you do on your device, Microsoft Edge shares your browsing history with Microsoft Windows through its Indexer. This information is stored locally on the device. It includes URLs, a category in which the URL might be relevant, such as “most visited”, “recently visited”, or “recently closed”, and also a relative frequency or recency within each category. Websites you visit while in InPrivate mode will not be shared. This information is then available to other applications on the device, such as the start menu or taskbar.

. If turned off, any previously shared data will be deleted.
To protect some video and music content from being copied, some streaming websites store Digital Rights Management (DRM) data on your device, including a unique identifier (ID) and media licenses. When you go to one of these websites, it retrieves the DRM info to make sure you have permission to use the content.
Microsoft Edge also stores cookies, small files that are put on your device as you browse the web. Many websites use cookies to store info about your preferences and settings, like saving the items in your shopping cart so you don't have to add them each time you visit. Some websites also use cookies to collect info about your online activity to show you interest-based advertising. Microsoft Edge gives you options to clear cookies and block websites from saving cookies in the future.
Microsoft Edge will send Do Not Track requests to websites when the
Send Do Not Track requests
setting is turned on. Websites may still track your activities even when a Do Not Track request is sent, however.
