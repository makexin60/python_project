By providing us with such information and/or by using our website and/or applications, you consent to our collection, storage, processing and use of your personal data in accordance with applicable law and the terms of this Policy.
If you do not agree with the Policy, do not provide us with any personal data. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with the required personal data, we may be totally or partially unable to answer your requests and you may be unable to access parts of our website and/or applications.
If you have any questions or comments regarding this Policy, or comments to improve its quality, please write to us using the contact form.
Scope of application
This Policy applies to users of the website (smood.ch) and mobile/tablet applications in Switzerland, as well as the Smood Driver application and any other website or application developed by Smood SA, including any user of Smood's applications, functional websites or other services. By user, Smood includes in particular its Customers, its couriers, and its Partners (restaurant owners in particular) as well as its order pickers.
Collected Data
We collect diligently and in strict compliance with the laws certain personal data (e. g. your name, date of birth, gender, language preferences, password hash, post address, delivery details (door access code, floor, etc.), email address, phone number, order history, product and restaurant preferences, information on your client account, third-party social network identifiers, and communications with you).
Furthermore, we may also collect and use data regarding your use of and your behavior on our website or our applications including session data, your browsing preferences, statistics about your visits, information about the device used to access our services, such as model, IP address or other unique identifier, operating system and version, software, display language, device movement data, and mobile network data.
By voluntarily submitting personal data to us, you agree to provide us with true, current and complete data at the time of submission. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your personal data and shall inform us of any amendment thereto. We shall bear no liability for the consequences of inaccurate or untrue data.
Location data (customers): We collect precise and/or approximate location data from customers' mobile devices if they allow us to do so. Smood collects this data from the moment a user orders on the website or app until the order is completed, and when the app is open on the user's mobile device. This data is used to improve the Customer's use of the website and the application, including security features, but also to detect and prevent fraud.
Location data (couriers, restaurants, order pickers): We collect this data when the Smood Driver application or any other relevant websites or applications developed by Smood SA are running in the foreground (the application is open and appears on the screen) or in the background (the application is open but does not appear on the screen) on their mobile device. When couriers start a delivery service via the Smood app, their precise and/or approximate location data must be provided to Smood. The same is true for restaurant owners and order pickers. Once the application or website developed by Smood SA has received permission to access location-based services via the mobile device's authorization system we may also obtain the precise and/or approximate location of a user's cell phone when the application is running in the foreground or background. We collect the data you provide directly to us when you create or modify your account. The data that drivers provide directly when creating or modifying their account is collected by Smood. This data may include: lastname, firstname, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, date and place of birth, nationality, work permit status, identity card, passport, driving license, AVS card, photos, marital status and emergency contact details. This data can be shared with other drivers or order pickers, if required.
Internal messaging
Internal messaging allows couriers to communicate with Smood, other couriers, or delivery customers. These conversations are not private between your interlocutor and yourself: Smood can consult the history of your conversations at any time if necessary.
Internal messaging allows you to share photos taken from the application, as well as your precise and/or approximate location (at your request).
Use of Personal Data
As a general rule, your personal data will not be used for any other purposes than to answer your queries, to process your orders, to communicate with you, to optimize our products, our website and our applications, to verify your experience and/or to achieve any other purpose for which your personal data was provided to us.
Your personal data will only be passed on to third parties if this is necessary to process your orders or if you have given your prior consent. Personal data may also be shared with third parties when required by law or by a court order.
In case of fraudulent use of our website or applications, or upon suspicion of punishable accesses, the data may be analysed for purposes of clarification and transmitted to the competent official authorities or to the third person affected by the fraud.
Additional clauses relating to the “Grocery"

Neither Smood nor Migros sell your personal data to third parties under any circumstances and do not use the personal data for commercial purposes. Smood reserves the right to transmit this number to Migros Geneva in order to improve the customer experience. Learn more about the Cumulus program at
