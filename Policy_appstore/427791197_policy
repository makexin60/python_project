3. What are Cookies and other similar technologies?
Cookies are small text files stored on computers, hard drives, smartphones or tablets (hereinafter referred to as the "Device"). Cookies contain a small amount of user-specific data and allow a server to offer a personalised page on the User's Device.
We may also use similar technologies on our Properties called "tags" (such as "tracking pixels" or "scripts"), "HTML5 local storage", "Web beacon" or "plug-ins", as well as "software development kits" (SDKs) and fingerprint recognition techniques, or technologies that allow the User to store or access information on their Device in order to identify the latter to analyse their visits to a Website or App.
These similar technologies can also be used together with Cookies to allow the storage of information about the Device used to access our Properties, or to allow its transmission to and from it.
In addition, by implementing Cookies and other similar technologies described above, if the User returns to our Properties, the latter will be able to read and recognise these technologies, that are mainly used for the operation of our Website or to improve the operation of the same or the App, as well as to provide commercial and marketing information to the owner of the Website.
4. Authorisation for the use of Cookies on our Website or on the App
In accordance with the note on the use of Cookies on the homepage of our Website (or before using the Apps for the first time) and in our Cookies Policy by clicking on the "Accept everything and continue to the site" ("Accept") button on the Cookie banner, you consent to the use of Cookies described here, unless you have set the preferences in the "Privacy Settings" area or have changed your browser settings to disable their use.
5. What categories of data do we collect and use?
When you visit the Website and use the comparison service or access the Apps (as a "User"), the following categories of data are collected:
We collect information about your visits to the Website and your use of the Website, such as the Device and browser you are using, the IP address or domain names of any computers connected to the Website, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of any request made, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and the computer environment used, the date and time of the visit, the duration of the visit, the referral site and the navigation path to the Website leading to the visit and interactions on the Website itself, including the services and offers you, the User, are interested in. Note that we may link this information to your User account, if it exists.

The methods of processing personal data carried out by the device’s operating system can be consulted in the device’s settings. If the User wishes to revoke the authorisation or modify the information that their device’s operating system is authorised to share with our App, they must access the device’s Settings. We use the location data solely to retrieve the closest airports and suggest the nearest solutions to the user during the departure location selection. Geographical coordinates are discarded immediately after being used to retrieve this information. However, the API call to the device’s GPS is logged in our access logs with a retention period of 15 days.

6. Types of Cookies used on our Website
6.1 Types of Cookies according to the management entity
Based on the entity that manages the Website or the domain from which Cookies are set and processed, the following types of Cookies exist:
Proprietary Cookies:
they are sent to the User's Device from a Website or a domain managed by us and from which the service requested by the User is provided.
Third-Party Cookies:

The Cookie remains on the hard drive until it reaches its expiration date. The maximum time for which we use Persistent Cookies on our Website is 1 year. Afterwards, your browser will delete the Cookie from your hard drive.
6.3 Types of Cookies and other similar technologies according to their purpose
Cookies and other similar technologies (collectively "Cookies") can be grouped as follows:
Cookies with necessary functions:
Technical Cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our Website or our App and are essential for browsing, as well as for the use of various features. For example, without them, you can't use search and comparison tools, keep your currency preferences, or log in and use your personal account.
We also use these Cookies to measure traffic statistics and the performance of different versions of the same site (commonly called "A/B tests") to detect navigation problems and organise content, as well as for security reasons.
Personalisation, advertising and remarketing Cookies:
these Cookies are used to collect and process information related to the use of our services and/or our content by the User, as well as the measurement of delivery and interaction with advertising, for example, by clicking on an advertisement, to create a profile of the User and their interests, to show the aforementioned User personalised ads and/or content  relevant to them on our Properties or on our advertisements on other Websites or Apps. Generally, the content of the Website or App is used to process or infer the interests of the User in order to determine the selection of future ads and content. To this end, we may also use the services provided by third parties on our behalf to collect data and/or offer advertisements during the User's visits to our Properties or on our advertisements on other Websites or Apps, in order to show you advertisements relating to goods and services that interest you.
Selection, delivery and reporting of third-party ads:
this purpose is linked to the collection and processing of information by third parties who place Cookies and other tracking technologies on our Properties and the combination with previously collected information, to select and provide personalised advertisements for the User and to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such advertisements. This includes the use of previously collected information about the User's interests in order to select ads, process data about which ads were shown, how often they were shown, when and where they were shown and whether the User has taken any action related to the ad, including, for example, clicking on an ad. This could include personalisation, i.e., the collection and processing of information related to the User's interests to personalise, at a later date, advertisements and/or content for the User in other contexts, such as on other Websites or Apps. However, these companies use information that is not directly identified (which does not include, by way of example, the User's name, address, email address or phone number).
These Cookies are "Third-Party Cookies" that are not managed by us and, due to their operation, are not accessible by us. We are also not responsible for their management and their purpose. Article 7 of this Cookies Policy contains more information on the profile of the aforementioned third parties, on the purposes of their processing and on the opt-out mechanism.
Transfer of data to third countries:
Transfer of data to third countries: the User explicitly consents to the transfer of data to countries that do not guarantee an adequate level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, including countries that are not affected by an adequacy decision and where certain national programmes outside the European Union can guarantee public authorities access to the User's personal data. For this purpose, further information on the transfer of data to third countries not covered by an adequacy decision can be found here.
Purpose of the transfer:
Third parties based in third countries may collect personal data through cookies or other tracking technologies when the User visits our Website and accepts the use of the following categories of Cookies: Cookies to improve the User experience and Cookies to personalise ads.
Type of data transferred:
we collect information about your visits to the Website and your use of the Website and/or our services, such as the Device and browser you are using, the IP address or domain names of any computers connected to the Website, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of any request made, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and the computer environment used, the date and time of the visit, the duration of the visit, the referral site and the navigation path to the Website leading to the visit and interactions on the Website itself, including the services and offers you, the User, are interested in.
Identity or categories of recipients:
data can be transferred to Ad-tech providers and other actors who place their Cookies or other technologies in our Properties, based in third countries and operating in the supply of targeted advertising. Article 7 of this Cookies Policy contains a list of these actors.
Transfer risk:
with reference to the transfer of data to the USA, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-311/18 of 16/7/2020 (Data Protection Commissioner/Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Maximillian Schrems) annulled the EU-USA Privacy Shield. In particular, the Court of Justice of the European Union has highlighted that the requirements of US domestic law, and in particular certain programmes that, for national security reasons, allow US public authorities to access personal data transferred from the EU to the United States, involve limitations in the protection of personal data that are not limited. In this sense, they do not meet the requirements substantially equivalent to those provided for by European law and, moreover, this legislation does not grant the interested parties rights that can be prosecuted in court against the US authorities. Legal basis of the transfer: the explicit consent of the User, if granted (Article 49 of the GDPR, paragraph 1, letter A).
Legal basis for the transfer:
explicit consent of the User, if provided.

4. Who sees, receives and uses the data and where does this take place?
Categories of data recipients
We share your personal data, for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, with the following categories of recipient:
our authorised employees and/or associates who provide assistance and consultancy services in the areas of administration, products, legal advice, the Support Service (where available) and IT systems, and those responsible for maintaining our network and hardware and software equipment; airlines, hotels, car hire companies, insurance companies, tour operators and any other party to whom personal data must be communicated in order to provide a service requested by the User and/or Customer, and who thereby operate as independent data controllers. Note that in accordance with new regulations introduced in the United States and other countries, airlines are required to allow customs and border authorities access to flight passenger data. For this reason, in some situations we may communicate information that we have collected on the passengers included in a reservation to the competent authorities in the countries on the Customer's travel itinerary, if required by local law;
our third-party service providers (including other lastminute.com group entities) who process your personal data on our behalf and under our instructions for the above purposes and thereby acting as data controllers, for example those who provide us with IT and hosting services, call centres and assistance, analytical and administration services, etc.;
social media platforms with which we have a commercial agreement, if expressly requested by the User (e.g. when sharing information generated by our site on such platforms), when downloading our app and consenting, via our privacy policy or via the social media platform, to our sharing information about your online activity with such partners, even when you have not accessed the social media platform, or when such commercial partners, who provide us with functional capabilities, request details about the device on which the app is installed, which they are entitled to do.  The information shared will be governed by the privacy policy of the social media platform. The competent authorities, if required by the applicable legislation;
the competent authorities and third-party law enforcement agencies, where it is necessary to enforce our terms and conditions of use and protect and defend our rights or our property or the rights and property of third parties;

A complete list of subjects to whom personal data may be communicated is available from our registered office and can be requested by email to privacy@jetcost.com.
4.2. International data transfer
The processing of Users' personal data will take place at the data controller's registered office (see section 1), on the lastminute.com group servers and at the offices of any other subjects to whom the data may be transmitted for the purpose of providing the requested services to the data controller.
Since we are an international travel company, we also transfer your personal data to:
Countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) which provide an adequate level of data protection, such as Switzerland, in accordance with the European Commission's "adequacy decisions" which recognise the protection offered by some countries as adequate;
Countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where data protection laws may provide less protection than EEA legislation. This happens when:
we communicate data to independent data controllers who may process data outside the EEA to provide a service requested by the User;
we communicate the data to our service providers who act as data controllers on our behalf and who may be in countries outside the EEA. When such transfers take place, we ensure that they are done in accordance with this privacy policy and that this is governed by the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to ensure adequate protection for data subjects. Our suppliers who act as data controllers may be involved in activities such as responding to requests, providing advertising and marketing services on our behalf and providing assistance services via electronic communications or call centres.
Any Users requiring further details regarding the safeguards put in place should email us at privacy@jetcost.com

9. Information about Cookies
For more information, see our
Cookie Policy
..
10. Privacy notice for Facebook
10.1. Custom Facebook audience - Facebook pixels
We use the "Custom Audiences" remarketing function of Facebook Inc. (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025 or, for users residing in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland). This function allows us to show interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads") to Users who visit our website when they are on Facebook, and to analyse these Facebook ads for statistical and market-research purposes, which helps us optimise future advertising. This allows us to offer more relevant advertisements.
For this purpose, we use the "Facebook pixel" on our website.
When a User visits our website and carries out an action, the Facebook pixel is activated and reports the action. We then know when a User has taken action after seeing our Facebook Ad. We can also reach the same User again using the custom audience. The pixel then allows us to track the behaviour of Users when they are redirected to our Website by clicking on a Facebook ad. We then know when a User has taken action after seeing our Facebook Ad. We can also reach the same User again using the custom audience.
This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook Ads for statistical and market-research purposes. The data we collect in this way is anonymous, i.e. we do not see the personal of individual Users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook and this is why we inform our Users, based on our understanding of the situation. Facebook may link the data to the User's Facebook account and use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook's Data Usage Policy
https://it-it.facebook.com/policy.php
. Such data may allow Facebook and its partners to show ads on or off Facebook. A Cookie may also be stored on the User's computer for these purposes.
10.2. Facebook SDK
We use the Facebook Software Development Kit (SDK) in our app. The Facebook SDK is distributed and managed by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA or, for Users residing in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. This integration allows us to link various Facebook services to our app (i.e. Facebook Analytics, Facebook Ads, Login with Facebook via the SDK, Facebook Account Kit, sharing on Facebook, Facebook Graph APIs and Facebook App Events).
Specifically, we have linked the following Facebook SDK services to our app:
Login with Facebook:
allows Users to register with Facebook or log in through their own Facebook account.
Facebook App Events:
to understand the actions of people when they are using our app and gauge the effectiveness of app advertisements on a User's mobile device. We use this service to evaluate the reach of our publicity campaigns and use of the Facebook SDK. Facebook supplies us with only an aggregate analysis of the behaviour of our app users.
In addition, since our app is linked to the Facebook SDK services, we must follow Facebook's policies, which require us to share the following User data with Facebook when downloading the app, even when Users have not logged on to the social media platform:
anonymous online identifiers;
information confirming that the app has actually been downloaded;
type of device used to download the app;
name of the device model;
geographic area;
time zone;
internet service provider;
size and definition of the device's screen;
the device's CPU core;
external storage of the device in Gb
free space in the device's external storage in Gb
time zone of the device
By downloading our application, Users give their consent to the communication of data to Facebook in the above manner.
Further information about Facebook SDK for iOS is available at:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios
For Android, go to:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android
.
You can check and change the status of your Facebook link and the related access privileges of our apps at any time in your Facebook profile settings (
https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications
). If you wish to delete the link between Facebook and our app, you must log in to Facebook and make the appropriate changes in your profile settings.
11. Update and previous versions of this privacy policy
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time in accordance with this section. If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will post the revised privacy policy on our website and update the "last updated" date at the top of this privacy policy.
Previous versions of this privacy policy are available here.
