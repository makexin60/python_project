Sensitive information
: for example, information about your health and disabilities where we need to make any reasonable adjustments.
Why we collect, use and store this personal data
We collect, use and store your personal data for the reasons set out below.
Where this is necessary for Fly Victor to enter into an employment contract with you.
To make informed decisions on recruitment and assess your suitability for the role.
To reimburse you for any agreed expenses incurred in the application process.
Where necessary for Fly Victor’s legitimate interests, as listed below, and where our interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
To improve our recruitment process and activities.
To contact you about future career opportunities at Fly Victor.
Protecting our legitimate business interests and legal rights, including, use in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, auditing, investigative and disciplinary purposes (including disclosure of such information in connection with legal process or litigation) and other ethics and compliance reporting requirements.
To analyse and monitor the diversity of the workforce in accordance with applicable laws. This includes, for example, compliance with equal opportunity employment laws.
Where we require the information to enter into an employment or services contract with you, or where we are required under applicable employment, social security, social protection or other laws applicable to us, the provision of information is mandatory. If you do not provide the relevant data, then we may not be able to conclude an employment contract with you or we may need to withdraw your offer of employment. All other provision of your information is optional. Where you do not provide the relevant data for in these circumstances, the consequences will be explained to you at the time.
How we share your personal data
Your personal data will be shared with companies providing services under contract to Fly Victor as part of the recruitment process, such as psychometric tests or assessment tests.
Your personal data also will be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if mandated by law or if required for the protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws.
In the event that a Fly Victor business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.
Your choices and rights
You have the right to ask Fly Victor for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide in a structured, machine readable format. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement). Where we have asked for your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time. If you ask to withdraw your consent to Fly Victor processing your data, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority.
International transfers
Your personal data will be processed in or accessed from jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland by members of the Fly Victor group and certain service providers in jurisdictions that do not have equivalent data protection laws to those in the EEA for the purposes outlined above.
When we transfer your data within the Fly Victor group, we make use of standard contractual clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission. When we transfer your data to organisations outside Fly Victor, we also use European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses to safeguard the transfer, unless we transfer personal data to a third party that has implemented Binding Corporate Rules or which uses the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, in which case we may rely on one of those mechanisms to safeguard the transfer. For further information, including how to obtain a copy of the documents used to protect your information, please contact us as described in the Contact Us section below.

We will update the date at the top of this privacy notice accordingly and encourage you to check for changes to this privacy notice, which will be available at [LINK].
