Your Rights and Choices
GDPR applies to collection and processing of personal information in the EU and EEA and in accordance with GDPR and related laws and regulations you may have the following rights:
Access: to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process your personal information, and to obtain a copy of the personal information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to personal information relating to you, and not to any other player or person.)
Rectification or Correction: to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated.
Erasure (deletion): to request that Instabridge deletes your personal information, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfil the purposes for which Instabridge collected it. This right may be limited to the extent that Instabridge is permitted or required by applicable law to retain your information. (Note that if you request deletion of your personal information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose related Account information and access. If you decide to use or access the Services again, Instabridge may consider this a new Account and may collect personal information associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
Restriction or objection to processing: to object to Instabridge’s processing of your personal information, or request that Instabridge restricts that processing. Because the information that Instabridge collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal information, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this information. This right may be limited to the extent that Instabridge is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the information. (Note that if you object to the processing of your personal information, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.)
Portability: to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.
Request to be informed: to request information about third parties with which your personal information has been shared.
Request to review: to review decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing if these decisions could affect your data subject rights.
Please note that these rights are not absolute. We may decline requests to exercise your data subject rights if there is a valid reason—such as being unable to verify your identity, the request potentially infringing on a third party’s rights or applicable law, or if fulfilling the request could disrupt our Services or prevent us from providing a requested service.
In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and processed certain types of personal information with your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time in the manner described when you provided consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.
If you are unhappy with our processing of your personal data and/or consider it to be in contrary to applicable legislation you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory data protection authority (“DPA”) (such as with the DPA in your country of residence, the DPA in the country of your place of work or the DPA in the country where the alleged infringement has occurred). In Sweden, the supervisory authority is the
Swedish Supervisory Authority for Privacy Protection
(“Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten”).
We will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved.
To exercise the aforementioned rights please contact us at the following address: privacy@instabridge.com or Degoo Backup AB, Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm. In order to ensure that you receive a swift response, please state in your letter your full name and, if applicable, your address, user name and the email address used for registration. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.
Data Retention
We will keep your data for as long as you have an account in the Services or for as long as we need to keep any personal data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. After this your personal data will be deleted.
We may also retain anonymous data indefinitely.
Security
We take all reasonable technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and any other unlawful forms of processing.
Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us.
Use By Minors
Our Services are designed for a general audience and require all users to be above the minimum age to consent for data processing as a condition of access. By installing or using our Services you represent and warrant to us that you are above the minimum age to consent for data processing in your domicile.
If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, and believe that minor has uploaded personal information in connection with our Services without your consent, or if you wish to review information collected from your minor child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “Contact Us” below. If we become aware that a minor has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will use reasonable efforts to delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it.
International Transfers of Your Personal Data
If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland then we may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third party suppliers and trusted partners located in countries that are outside of the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (including, but not limited to the USA) or to our partners/related third parties in connection with the above purposes. The same rule applies for users outside the EU/EAA, that is your data may be transferred outside of the country from which it was originally collected. Please be aware that the countries to which we may transfer data may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.
When transferring personal data outside the EU/EEA, we will ensure that the country in which your personal data will be handled has been deemed “adequate” by the EU Commission under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or if your personal data will be transferred to a country which the EU Commission does not consider to have an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will take all necessary steps required under applicable law in order for such transfer of information across borders to be compliant with applicable law. We will only transfer your personal data to a country outside the EU/EEA where; (i) the transfer is being safeguarded by the use of EU model clauses (under Article 46.2 in the GDPR) or (ii) where the recipient is certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework (under Article 45 in the GDPR).
By installing or using the App or Services, you consent to those transfers of information to other countries and to service providers.
You can find further information about the rules on data transfers outside the EU/EEA, including the mechanisms that we rely upon, on the European Commission website (
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en

Your Rights and Choices
GDPR applies to collection and processing of personal information in the EU and EEA and in accordance with GDPR and related laws and regulations you may have the following rights:
Access: to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process your personal information, and to obtain a copy of the personal information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to personal information relating to you, and not to any other player or person.)
Rectification or Correction: to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated.
Erasure (deletion): to request that Instabridge deletes your personal information, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfil the purposes for which Instabridge collected it. This right may be limited to the extent that Instabridge is permitted or required by applicable law to retain your information. (Note that if you request deletion of your personal information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose related Account information and access. If you decide to use or access the Services again, Instabridge may consider this a new Account and may collect personal information associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
Restriction or objection to processing: to object to Instabridge’s processing of your personal information, or request that Instabridge restricts that processing. Because the information that Instabridge collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal information, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this information. This right may be limited to the extent that Instabridge is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the information. (Note that if you object to the processing of your personal information, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.)
Portability: to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.
Request to be informed: to request information about third parties with which your personal information has been shared.
Request to review: to review decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing if these decisions could affect your data subject rights.
Please note that these rights are not absolute. We may decline requests to exercise your data subject rights if there is a valid reason—such as being unable to verify your identity, the request potentially infringing on a third party’s rights or applicable law, or if fulfilling the request could disrupt our Services or prevent us from providing a requested service.
In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and processed certain types of personal information with your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time in the manner described when you provided consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.
If you are unhappy with our processing of your personal data and/or consider it to be in contrary to applicable legislation you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory data protection authority (“DPA”) (such as with the DPA in your country of residence, the DPA in the country of your place of work or the DPA in the country where the alleged infringement has occurred). In Sweden, the supervisory authority is the
Swedish Supervisory Authority for Privacy Protection
(“Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten”).
We will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved.
To exercise the aforementioned rights please contact us at the following address: privacy@instabridge.com or Degoo Backup AB, Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm. In order to ensure that you receive a swift response, please state in your letter your full name and, if applicable, your address, user name and the email address used for registration. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.
Data Retention
We will keep your data for as long as you have an account in the Services or for as long as we need to keep any personal data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. After this your personal data will be deleted.
We may also retain anonymous data indefinitely.
Security
We take all reasonable technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and any other unlawful forms of processing.
Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us.
Use By Minors
Our Services are designed for a general audience and require all users to be above the minimum age to consent for data processing as a condition of access. By installing or using our Services you represent and warrant to us that you are above the minimum age to consent for data processing in your domicile.
If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, and believe that minor has uploaded personal information in connection with our Services without your consent, or if you wish to review information collected from your minor child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “Contact Us” below. If we become aware that a minor has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will use reasonable efforts to delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it.
International Transfers of Your Personal Data
If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland then we may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third party suppliers and trusted partners located in countries that are outside of the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (including, but not limited to the USA) or to our partners/related third parties in connection with the above purposes. The same rule applies for users outside the EU/EAA, that is your data may be transferred outside of the country from which it was originally collected. Please be aware that the countries to which we may transfer data may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.
When transferring personal data outside the EU/EEA, we will ensure that the country in which your personal data will be handled has been deemed “adequate” by the EU Commission under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or if your personal data will be transferred to a country which the EU Commission does not consider to have an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will take all necessary steps required under applicable law in order for such transfer of information across borders to be compliant with applicable law. We will only transfer your personal data to a country outside the EU/EEA where; (i) the transfer is being safeguarded by the use of EU model clauses (under Article 46.2 in the GDPR) or (ii) where the recipient is certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework (under Article 45 in the GDPR).
By installing or using the App or Services, you consent to those transfers of information to other countries and to service providers.
You can find further information about the rules on data transfers outside the EU/EEA, including the mechanisms that we rely upon, on the European Commission website (
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en
).

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome
