Annual Subscription
After subscription, ads will be removed from the RouteDraw app, and trial features will be unlocked. The subscription fee will be deducted from your account annually, until you cancel the subscription.
Android
Google's subscription cancellation policy is that a user will not receive a refund for the current billing period when canceling a subscription, but will continue to receive issues and updates of the relevant subscription content (if any) for the remainder of the billing period, regardless of the cancellation.
If you want a refund for the current billing period, you need to contact us directly within one week after subscription. Normally, we do not accept refund unless your subscription does not have any effect due to verification issue.
Google will show the customer location in our order record. The location just includes the country, and the region (i.e. Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, or New Territories for HK customers, if available). No other personal information is found in the order record.
After subscription, the purchase token, order ID and expiry time of your subscription will be stored in the RouteDraw database. These are used for user support purpose.
After subscription expiration, the information of the subscription will be removed from the RouteDraw database within 1 day, and will be removed from the backup store within 1 month. (Note that Google has different policies, so Google Play may still show your subscription history.)

Use Mapbox Mapping Services
As RouteDraw depends on the mapping services provided by Mapbox, if Mapbox terminates services, the functions of the app will be affected.
Mapbox services will collect anonymized location and usage data to improve the map by default. But you can choose not to share the data via the settings, without affecting the app functionality. RouteDraw will prompt you about this the first time you enter the app. On the other hand, our company will not collect usage data.
Terms of service for Mapbox can be found at:
https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos/
If there are map display related issues, please check
Mapbox Status
first.
As the drawing logic is based on the map display data, which is simplified and does not preserve junction info. Therefore, if you draw while zoomed out, the route will have a higher degree of simplification. And whether two ways are connected is based on estimation, and therefore may not be correct. Also, a map object may show slightly different coordinates at different zoom levels.
Use Search the Map Function
If search by name, your search request will be sent to the server, and your IP address will be logged by Google Cloud, and kept for 2 days. These are normal web server access/error logs, the log data may be used for issue diagnosis, but will not be used for any other purposes.
The data within your search request, like the query string and etc, will not be logged. But we reserve the right to log the related data temporarily for diagnostic purpose, if there are errors occurred.
Publish Map Screenshot
As the mapping services are provided by Mapbox, if you publish a screenshot of the RouteDraw app with the map data, you must attribute Mapbox and OpenStreetMap, along with the copyright notice for RouteDraw. Example notice:
