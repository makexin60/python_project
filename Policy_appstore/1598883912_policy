Privacy Policy
Last updated: [Insert Date Here]
Your privacy is important to us. At Vestai Tech Ltd. (“We,” “Us,” or “Our”), the creators of AI Calorie Scanner, We are committed to protecting your data.
This policy explains what data We collect, why We collect it, and how it’s handled.

## 1. What We Collect and Why
### Identity & Access
When you sign up for AI Calorie Scanner, We may collect your email address, name, or other identifiers to create and personalize your account,
send essential updates, and manage subscriptions. If you sign up using third-party services (e.g., Google, Apple), We may also access your email address and name as provided by those platforms.
**We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties** for marketing purposes.
### Food Images
When you capture or upload pictures of food for calorie or nutritional analysis, We process these images with Our AI systems to estimate calorie counts and other relevant data.
We store the images only for the time necessary to generate results and improve the Service. Unless you choose to save these images in the app for personal reference,
they are either deleted or anonymized after processing. **We do not share these images with third parties for marketing or profiling purposes.**
### Calorie & Nutritional Data
AI Calorie Scanner may gather user-input data (e.g., food items, calorie counts, or other nutritional information) to provide calorie scanning and estimation services.
We do not analyze or use this data for advertising. It is stored securely to power the app’s functionality.
### Billing Information
For subscription payments, We may use third-party payment providers (such as Stripe). Your payment information is handled securely by these providers and never stored on Our servers.
Payment processors may collect additional information, like billing address, for tax or legal compliance.
### Geolocation Data
We may log IP addresses to help prevent unauthorized access and detect spam signups. This information is retained as long as your account is active.
### Website/App Interactions
We may collect data such as browser type, operating system, pages visited, and clicks on Our Website or within the app for analytics purposes—this helps improve user experience and measure performance.
### Cookies
We use cookies and similar technologies to store session data and preferences, ensuring a seamless experience. You can adjust cookie preferences in your browser settings.

2. **To Comply with Legal Requirements**: If required by law (e.g., through a valid court order), We may disclose data. We will make an effort to notify you unless prohibited by law.
3. **To Provide Support**: We may access your account details to address technical or billing inquiries.
