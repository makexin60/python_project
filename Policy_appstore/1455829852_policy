What is the GDPR and how does it affect Redbox Platform customers?
On May 25, 2018, The European Union began to enforce a new data privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replacing the previous Data Protection Directive. A primary aim of the GDPR is to provide people in the EU greater control over their personal data and data which is collected about them.
Any company that collects (or processes on behalf of the company that collects) personal data of persons in the EU falls under the scope of the GDPR, even if the company has no physical presence in the European Union. This means that most businesses with a global or online presence, including Redbox Mobile's customers are affected.
A detailed guide to GDPR from the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office), which is the UK's data protection authority, can be found
here.
Privacy Policy

Marketing Activities
, such as registrations as part of webinars, conference events, emails, website browsing, and related activity.

The GDPR primarily applies to controllers and processors located in the European Economic Area ("the EEA") with some exceptions.
Individuals risk losing the protection of the GDPR if their personal data is transferred outside of the EEA.

A transfer of personal data outside the protection of the GDPR (which we refer to as a 'restricted transfer'), most often involves a transfer from inside the EEA to a country outside the EEA.

Redbox Mobile Services Privacy Policy
Introduction
Redbox Mobile provides paid search and mobile app optimisation services ("Services") that enable advertisers and developers (collectively, "Customer(s)") to:
Measure and analyse the effectiveness of their mobile app marketing campaigns.
Optimise paid search services based on certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below).
The Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behaviour related to their marketing campaigns.
This
Redbox Mobile Services Privacy Policy
describes Redbox Mobile's privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by Redbox Mobile when Customers use our Services. This Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of Redbox Mobile's publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our
Marketing Activities Privacy Policy.
Furthermore, Redbox Mobile and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by Redbox Mobile and their use by Customers ("Agreement(s)"). Such Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information. Nothing in this
Redbox Mobile Services Privacy Policy
negates such additional obligations.
For the purpose of this
Redbox Mobile Services Privacy Policy
, any reference to "End User(s)" means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer's advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer's Applications, websites, products and services.
End User Data Received and Processed by Redbox Mobile
When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by Redbox Mobile (collectively, "End User Data").
Technical Information
this refers to technical information related to an End User's mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
Technical Identifiers
this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application. For example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices); Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.
Engagement Information
this refers to information relating to the Customer's ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer's website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyse within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information ("
PII
"), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and Redbox Mobile, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by Redbox Mobile. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User's email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by Redbox Mobile
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer ("Registration Information" and together with the End User Data, "Customer Data"), including Customer name and Customer details, billing information and names and contact details of Customer employees and representatives who are using the Services (e.g. email, phone number and address). When a Customer uses the Services, Redbox Mobile may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Customer is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g. browser type, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Customer ("Log Data").
How Data is Collected
Customer Data may be collected through various methods, including:
When provided voluntarily (e.g. Customer's Registration Information).
When the Customer integrates Redbox Mobile's API's, redirect links, JavaScript tags, cookies or similar data collection technologies into their Applications, websites and/or ads ("Collection Technologies"). For explanations on cookies and similar technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.
From the various advertising networks and third parties that are used by the Customer in connection with the measurement and analysis of Customer's marketing campaigns and that have partnered with Redbox Mobile ("Partners").
How Data is Used by Redbox Mobile
When Redbox Mobile receives End User Data from a Customer, it uses such End User Data as follows:
to provide such Customer with the Services they have subscribed for. Such services may include, without limitation, ad serving, analytics and ad fraud protection services. Please visit

End User Data does not contain PII such as End User names, physical addresses, phone numbers or other similar personal data that can directly identify an individual.
With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, we use such information to authenticate login to the Services, to communicate with Customer and to process any payments in connection with the Services. Additionally, we may use: (i) Registration Information to inform Customer of any updates to the Services, including new features and functionalities; and (ii) Log Data to understand how Customers are using the Services so that we may efficiently audit, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customers.
Redbox Mobile may use information derived from the aggregation of End User Data and/or Log Data with other data for research and analytics purposes and improvement and marketing of the Services ("Aggregated Data"). Aggregated Data shall be anonymous and in no way reveal the identity of the Customer or any End User.

With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis Redbox Mobile relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between Redbox Mobile and the Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyse and improve the Services.
The laws of certain jurisdictions may provide End Users with various rights in connection with the processing of End User Data, including:
The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;
The right to access certain information about you that we process;
The right to have us correct or update any Personal Information;
