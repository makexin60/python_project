Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is really important to Universe Exploration Company. ("Universe Exploration Company", "we", "our" and/or "us"). With this in mind, we're providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services, as defined in our Terms. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.
Revisions to this Privacy Policy
Any information that is collected through our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you by email or through the Services, and we'll update the "Last Updated Date" above to indicate when those changes will become effective.
Collection and Use of Information
Information Collected or Received from You
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
Account Information
If you create an Account, we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name and email address ("PIP). If you use the Services through third party login credentials such as your Apple iCloud account, we'll collect a unique device identifier from your mobile device, so that we have a way of associating your content with you.
Information You Provide to Us
To make it easier for you to use the Services, we will give you the option of allowing Universe Exploration Company access to certain information on your mobile device, such as your camera roll, photo library, microphone, and sound files. We'll collect this information only for the purposes of providing the Services to you.
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies
Like many online platform operators, we may use automated data collection tools such as Cookies to collect certain information about how our Services are used. "Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your device by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. If you don't accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party service providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. This Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by third parties.
Information Related to Use of the Services
Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"). Log Data may include information such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that you were visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which you browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that you clicked on, and other data. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize, and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to your needs and preferences. We may use your IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
Information Collected by Third Party Service Providers
We may use third party data collection tools such as Amplitude, AppSee, and Mixpanel to provide us with analytics data about your interactions with our Services. For more information about Amplitude, the information it collects, and how you can manage the information collected from you, please visit https://amplitude.com/privacy; and for AppSee, please visit https://www.appsee.com/legal/privacypolicy. You may opt-out of Mixpanel's automatic retention of data collected while using the Services by visiting https://mixplanel.com/optout/. To track opt-outs, Mixpanel uses a persistent opt-out cookie placed on your device. If you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter the browser's cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.
Information Sent by Your Mobile Device
We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
Location Information
When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device's GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.
Information that We Share with Third Parties
We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:
Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users,including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims or legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights, and safety and the property, rights, and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.
