6. How we use your data
6.1. Lawful basis
We will only use your personal data when the applicable legislation allows us to. In other words, we have to ensure that we have a lawful basis for such use.
We process your personal data relying on the following lawful bases:
processing is necessary for performance of a contract or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract; when you participate in the Campaign a contractual relationship is formed between you and Crypto.com;
processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us as a contracting entity and our interests do not contradict your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms (for instance, the interest in assessing your eligibility to participate in the Campaign);
consent, if required.
We do not usually need your consent for processing personal data concerning you. If we need it, we will ask for it and provide you with the respective information as required by law. Depending on the applicable data protection framework, for example, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area
(“EEA”)
or the United Kingdom
(“UK”)
, you may also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
If the prize of a Campaign includes passes to an event for you and a guest of your choosing, you guarantee that your guest who will receive a pass has acknowledged and agreed for their information to be used for the purposes listed herein. In addition, you guarantee that you and your guest have acknowledged and shall adhere to the event-specific rules as provided by the event organizer.
6.2. Purposes for which we will use your personal data
When you participate in the Campaign, we use the personal data you provide to conduct the Campaign. Namely, we collect and use your personal data for the purposes of carrying out the Campaign, monitoring for compliance with the applicable written rules, assessing your eligibility to participate in the Campaign, prize draw, identity verification and prize delivery.
Further information on the purposes can be found in the respective written rules governing the Campaign.
Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful basis depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your personal data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.
7. Disclosures of your data
We share your personal data with our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations, our group companies, and affiliates (as described below) in order to organize and carry out the Campaign. When using third party service providers, they are required to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We may pass your personal data to the following third parties:
entities organizing the event related to the Campaign in cases of giveaways and sweepstakes;
entities assisting us with the organization of the Campaign;
companies and organizations that assist us in processing, verifying or refunding transactions/orders you make in relation to the Campaign;

regulatory and law enforcement authorities, whether they are outside or inside of the EEA, where the law allows or requires us to do so.
We disclose collected personal data to the relevant internal departments on a “need to know” basis. We may also provide personal data to other affiliated companies within the Group or to
external service providers, contract processors (e.g. platform, hosting, shipping service providers) in order to carry out the campaign. Platform and hosting service providers may have access to personal data from a country outside the EEA. Where needed, as an appropriate safeguard we have agreed on standard contractual clauses pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR with these providers. More information on this topic is published
here
(attention: a link to a third-party website)
.
8. International transfers
We share your personal data within our group. This will involve transferring your personal data outside Hong Kong, EEA, the UK or the origin of where your data is collected.
We follow the specific legal framework applicable to such transfers. For example, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an
adequate
level of protection
(
attention: a link to a third-party website
) for personal data by the European Commission or the UK government, as applicable to your particular case;
a specific contract approved by the European Commission or the UK government, which gives safeguards to the processing of personal data, the so-called Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable to your particular case.
Please contact our Data Protection Officer at
dpo@crypto.com
if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA or the UK.
9. Data security
While there is an inherent risk in any data being shared over the internet, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, damaged, or accessed in an unauthorised or unlawful way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a legitimate business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Depending on the nature of the risks presented by the proposed processing of your personal data, we will have in place the following appropriate security measures:
organisational measures
(including but not limited to staff training and policy development);
technical measures
(including but not limited to physical protection of data, pseudonymization and encryption); and
securing ongoing availability, integrity, and accessibility
(including but not limited to ensuring appropriate back-ups of personal data are held).
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any relevant regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

10. Data retention
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Here are some exemplary factors which we usually consider when determining how long we need to retain your personal data:
in the event of a complaint;
if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you or if we consider that we need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims;
to comply with any applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements with respect to certain types of personal data;
if information is needed for audit purposes;
in accordance with relevant industry standards or guidelines;
in accordance with our legitimate business need to prevent abuse of the Campaign. We will retain your personal data for the time of the Campaign to prevent the appearance of abusive behavior. For the same purpose we may also retain your’ personal data for a certain period after the Campaign’s end.
Please note that under certain condition(s), you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. We will honor your deletion request ONLY if the condition(s) is met.
11. Your legal rights
You have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your personal data. If you need more detailed information or wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us.

request rectification of your personal data by asking us to rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete information you think is incomplete, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
request erasure of your personal data by asking us to delete or remove personal data we hold about you; note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you;
object to the processing of your personal data, where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms; in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
require that decisions be reconsidered if they are made solely by automated means, without human involvement; we use automated tools to make sure that you are eligible to participate in the Campaign taking into account our interests and legal obligations; if these automated tools indicate that you do not meet our acceptance criteria, you shall not be considered eligible to participate in the Campaign;
request restriction of processing your personal data, which enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data, if you want us to establish the data accuracy; where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or if you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party, and we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen (where technically feasible), your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format; note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;
withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent; if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you, but we will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent;
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Period for replying to a legitimate request
We shall reply to a legitimate request within the legally prescribed period according to the applicable legislation. If you are a resident of the EEA or the UK, the statutory period for us to
reply to a legitimate request is one month. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.Please note that we may request that you provide some details necessary to verify your identity when you request to exercise a legal right regarding your personal data.
