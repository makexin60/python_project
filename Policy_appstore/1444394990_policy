Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we may collect personal data such as your name, address, contact details, and health and fitness information. Rest assured, we are committed to protecting your privacy and security.
‍
Location:
We understand that your privacy is important to you, so we only access your device's location to suggest nearby clinics and service providers and show region-specific content. You have the option to disable location tracking at any time.
‍
Camera and Microphone:
To ensure that we give you the best possible service during our teleconsultations, we kindly request that you grant us access to your device's camera and microphone. This is to aid in medical diagnoses. In addition, if you upload images to the app using your camera, we may need access to it for that purpose. We respect your privacy and will never access your device's camera or microphone for any other reason.

We value your privacy and are committed to keeping your medical information safe and secure. As users of the app, you may upload, download, or save your medical records or images to our platform for your records. We may request access to your device’s storage to access them. There is also an option to upload images from your device instead of taking a picture from within the platform itself. This permission gives us the ability to access only those images, and we do not access any other data saved on your device.
