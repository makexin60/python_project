1.
Data Collection & Processing
When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.
The list below describes what categories of personal data we collect and process about End-Users through our Solutions.
Please note that in some cases, we may process personal data on behalf of a business partner or one of our Customers in according with their instructions and the data processing agreement we have in place with them. See
Section 10
for more information on our different roles under data protection laws.
Account Data:
There are certain Solutions in relation to which we are the data controller (as further detailed in
Section 10
). With these Solutions, we may collect first and last name, date of birth, address, email, phone number, and other basic contact details, as well as any other personal data the End-User chooses to provide when they create an account with a Solution, contact support, and/or in order for us to provide them with a prescription.

We may process  corrective lenses parameters; lens analysis, lens power, eyes’ refraction error, and pupillary distance; your optical prescription; updated comprehensive
eye exam and; personal data received through a personal eye health questionnaire; depth data (which is required to measure eyes’ distance and head angle in real-time);
Usage Data
.
When you install or use our Solutions, we will automatically collect or generate technical personal data about you. We collect or generate such Usage Data either independently or with the help of third-party services (as detailed in Section 4 below), including through the use of “cookies” and other data collection technologies (as further detailed in Section 5 below). Such Usage Data mainly consists of connectivity, technical and aggregated information, such as IP addresses, session ID, non-identifying data regarding a device (such as device type, screen resolution, etc), operating system, various apps usage statistics, browser version, locale and language settings used,
general
location (country), date and time stamp, and otherwise data collected by Cookies and other data collection technologies, as further explained in Section 6 below.
Facial Images:
Our myRx PD Reader requires us to process frontal facial pictures (which are shrunk and obfuscated, and therefore do not allow the reidentification of any given individual in any way); and a "Calibration Image" (which is an image with a standard size such as plastic standard magnetic card to set as a reference object). Once the “Calibration Image” is identified within the image you have provided, we make reasonable efforts to apply an obfuscation
process to
avoid saving any recognizable details that may exist on the card “Calibration Image” on our systems. This “Calibration Image” will not be linked to you or any of your personal data;

Data Controller/Processor
Data protection laws and regulations typically distinguish between two main roles for parties who process personal data: the “Controller”/”Business”, and the “Processor”/”Service Provider” (as such terms are defined in the GDPR and CCPA, respectively). The Controller determines the purposes and means of the personal data processing, and the Processor processes the data on behalf of the Controller.
We will always be the
Controller of Account Data when collected, and Usage Data
.
However, depending on the nature of your engagement with our Solutions, we may be either the Controller or Processor of the other categories of your personal data enumerated in
Section 1
(i.e., your Optical Data or Facial Images).
When you use our Solutions as part of another company’s services, i.e. when you are not directly engaging with us, we will be the Processor of your personal data, and the company you are engaging with directly is the Controller.
The following chart describes our typical role in relation to the categories of personal data we process.

, please contact
such Customer directly
.
Please note that if you engage with us directly, then we are the Controller of the personal data processed through the Solution(s).

Individuals have rights concerning their personal data. Please contact us by email at:

if you wish to exercise your privacy rights under any applicable law, including the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), such as – to the extent applicable – the right to know/request access to (specific pieces of personal data collected; categories of personal data collected; categories of sources from whom the personal data was collected; purpose of collecting personal data; categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal data), to request rectification or erasure of your personal data held with Luna, or to restrict or object to such personal data’s processing (including the right to direct us not to sell your personal data to third parties now or in the future), or to port such personal data, or the right to equal services and prices (e.g. freedom from discrimination) (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you).

9. Data Controller/Processor
Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “data controller”, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor”, who processes the data on behalf of the data controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
Luna is the “data controller” of personal data relating to Visitors, Prospects and Business Contacts. With respect to such personal data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under the law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor.”
Luna is the “data processor” or “data controller with respect to personal data relating to End-Users. When Luna processes such data as a data processor, it does so behalf of its Customers, per their instructions and in accordance with the Data Processing Addendum we have with them. If we process End-Users’ personal data as a data controller, we will do so in accordance with our
Solutions Privacy Policy
.
