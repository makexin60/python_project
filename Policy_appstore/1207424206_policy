It is also designed to inform users about how the Company gathers and uses personal information submitted to it through the Service.
The Company will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this Policy and with all applicable U.S. laws as well as the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
In this Policy, “user” or “you” means any person viewing the Service or submitting any personal information to the Company in connection with using the Service.
In general, we will not collect, use, disclose, or otherwise process your personal information without your consent. However, we may do so in certain circumstances described below.
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and any changes will be posted on this page.
If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. If you have questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy, you should contact us at support@fullcodedev.wpengine.com.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including third party services used by the Company. The Company uses Google Analytics for marketing measurements, HubSpot for marketing automation, and Amazon Web Services for web hosting and emails. For these third party services, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies. The Company does not use any other third party services.
What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?
Personal Information
: As a user of Full Code, we will ask you to tell us your medical/professional role.
If you create an account, we will ask you for an email address.
If you are subscribing on behalf of an institutional customer, your name and institutional affiliation(s). In addition, if you contact the Company and disclose additional information about you, such as your email address, we may store that information.
“Personal Information” denotes the information referred to in this paragraph.
User Data
: When you use the Service, you may transmit to the Company certain user-specific data (“User Data”) that we use to provide the Service, including to but not limited to your operating and systems environment, your use of the Service, and additional information that the Service allows you to input, such as scoring and performance within simulation scenarios.
Web Tracking Information
: On our website, but not our smartphone or mobile applications, we, and third-party service providers that we engage to provide services to us (“Contractors”), use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Service efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Service. Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) includes the address of the website you visited before and after you visited the Company website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. We also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications, and our Contractors may also do so. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service. We will only process Web Tracking Information with your consent, which you may provide to us using a banner on our website.
How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
Personal Information
: We will use and store Personal Information for the purpose of delivering the Service (including to establish or renew your Company account), and to analyze and enhance the operation of the Service. For example, we record events to determine how often certain features of the Service are used. This enables us to identify possible improvements to the Service. With your consent if you create an account or submit a feedback message, we will enter Personal Information into our contact management database, and may use such database to send you marketing materials and to contact you regarding your interest in the Company’s products and services.
User Data
: We will use the User Data to provide the Service. We will aggregate User Data across all or a subset of users to create statistical information relating to the use of the Service, as described in “Aggregate Information” below.
Aggregate Data
: We also create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Service for analytical purposes. For example, we aggregate data to determine the Service’s number of users for each professional role (for instance, how many doctors use the Service), and to ascertain users’ performance (for instance, what percentage of doctors got Question 1 correct). Aggregated data is derived from Personal Information and User Data, but in its aggregated form it does not relate to or identify any particular client or individual or any specific user’s data. We use aggregated data to understand our customer base and to develop, improve and market our services.
Web Tracking Information
: We use Web Tracking Information only for those Users who use the Service via the website; we do not collect Web Tracking Information when Users use the service through smartphone and mobile applications. We use Web Tracking Information to administer the Service and to understand how well our Service is working, to store your user preferences, and to develop statistical information on usage of the Service. This allows us to measure overall effectiveness. We also use Web Tracking Information for marketing purposes.
Legal Exception
: Notwithstanding the above, the Company may use Personal Information and User Data to the extent required by law or legal process, or if in the Company’s reasonable discretion use is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect the Company’s legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the user.
What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?

: The Company will not disclose Personal Information to any third party except to our Contractors who are bound by written obligations of confidentiality, the institution(s) through which a User subscribed (if the User subscribed through an institution) or as described under “Permitted Disclosures” below.
User Data
: We only disclose User Data to any the designated administrators of the business entity that you establish via your account. Except as described above, we disclose User Data only to you, the user who submitted the User Data to the Company, to our Contractors who are bound by obligations of confidentiality, the institution(s) through which a User subscribed (if the User subscribed through an institution), and as described under “Permitted Disclosures” below.
Web Tracking Information
: We disclose Web Tracking Information collected through the Service’s website to Contractors for marketing purposes, in order to analyze the performance of the Service and the behavior of users, and to operate and improve the Service.
Aggregate Data
: We disclose de-identified aggregated data to third parties, such as potential customers, business partners, advertisers, and funding sources, in order to describe our business and operations. We also disclose de-identified, aggregated User Data to other Users of the Service so that they may gauge their performance. For example, after a doctor answers Question 1, we might disclose to that doctor what percentage of doctors answered Question 1 correctly.
Permitted Disclosures
: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to disclose any information the Company collects in connection with the Service, without further notice to you (a) to any successor to the Company’s business as a result of any merger, acquisition or similar transaction; and (b) to any law enforcement or regulatory authority to the extent required by law or if, in the Company’s reasonable discretion, disclosure is necessary to investigate fraud or any threat to the safety of any individual, to protect the Company’s legal rights or to protect the rights of third parties, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the user.
