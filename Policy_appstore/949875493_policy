How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Privacy Notice
This policy sets out how we use and protect Personal Information we collect about you when you use this website.
    “Personal Data” is any information that identifies you or that can be linked to you. You are not under any statutory
    or contractual obligation to provide us with Personal Data.
Who we are
Adzuna is the trading name of Adzuna Ltd, a privately-owned UK company.
What Personal Data we may hold and process about you
Personal Data you provide Adzuna
We may hold any information you provide to us including your
    e-mail address, user account details, information you provide to us in ValueMyCV and information contained in your
    CV. We may also store details of your job applications, job searching preferences and standard browsing data (including for example IP address, referring websites, browser software and operating system).
Personal Data from third-party websites
Adzuna may also be provided with information when you
    sign up or apply for jobs with third-party websites. This information may relate to activity measurement (for
    example through the use of a tracking pixel) or where the third-party has obtained your consent to send you job
    email alerts and contracts Adzuna to do this on their behalf. Your relationship with any third-party website is
    governed purely by your agreement with them.
The purposes of the processing
Our use of Personal Data may include some or all of the following:
Sending you important information which we believe you would reasonably expect. This may include for example
        changes to our Terms and Conditions or other important product or service news
Carrying out your request to submit a job application
Delivering to you any job email alerts you have requested from us
Personalising your job search experience. For example, we may use your work or search history to help show you
        the most relevant jobs
Where you have explicitly consented to it, contacting you about relevant jobs based on your CV and/or other
        Personal Data in accordance with your preferences
Identifying and resolving any complaints or requests for data access or correction
Managing our infrastructure and business operations and complying with internal policies and procedures
With your consent, we use automated decision-making and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to provide you with
        insight about Personal Data contained within your CV
To provide targeted, personalised, or location-based content, services, and advertising from us and third parties
We may use anonymised data internally for analytics or license anonymised data to third parties, but we will not license Personal Data with third parties unless there is a lawful basis for processing
The lawful basis for the processing
Consent
In certain cases, such as the delivery of job alerts by email or contacting you about
    relevant jobs based on your CV, Adzuna relies on your explicit (opt-in) consent. You may withdraw your consent at
    any time by going to your account settings or by unsubscribing from related email communication.
Legitimate Interest
Adzuna will process your Personal Data where there is a legitimate interest.
    This may include, for example, emailing you about changes to our products or Terms & Conditions.
Performance of a contract
Adzuna may hold contracts with third parties where Adzuna is acting as a
    Data Processor. In these cases Adzuna may have a contractual obligation to use your Personal Data in a way that you
    have consented to with the third party. For example, Adzuna may deliver job email alerts to you under contract from
    a third party.
Compliance with a legal obligation
Legal obligations can arise where it is necessary for Adzuna
    to process Personal Data. For example, Adzuna may be required to retain records for certain periods of time in order
    to comply with local legal requirements.
Recipients of Personal Data
Third party service providers
Adzuna may use third-party service providers for operations and to
    help us protect our users. Examples of such providers include but are not limited to MailChimp, Google and Amazon Web Services. In these cases we may need to share your Personal Data with them. More information about how Google will use your personal data can be found on
Google’s Privacy and Terms site.
These third parties act as Data Processors for Adzuna and can only process Personal Data for the purpose stated in our contract with them. They must also comply with all applicable data protection laws.
Advertisers
If you apply for a job directly through Adzuna then we may send your Personal Data
    to the Advertiser (for example an end employer or a Post an Ad Advertiser). Advertisers agree to comply with our
    Terms & Conditions and all of their responsibilities under applicable data protection laws.
International transfer of Personal Data
Some Personal Data we hold is transferred internationally to third parties to jurisdictions outside of the EEA or to countries and territories not covered by the UK’s current adequacy regulations. In this situation we ensure that the processing of Personal Data is safeguarded either
    through the inclusion of SCCs (standard contractual clauses) in our contract with the third parties, or through
    other contractual clauses authorised by the Information Commissioner’s Office.
Storage of your Personal Data
If you do not use Adzuna or interact with our services for a significant period of time, we will delete some or all
    of your Personal Data from our site. Our criteria for deletion is determined according to the frequency of
    interactions observed and the nature of the Personal Data.
