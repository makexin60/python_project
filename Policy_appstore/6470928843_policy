How To Setup QLAB
Create multiple cues and play each cue in QLab remotely with just a touch.
Press the lock button at the top to individually delete, enter, and move each cue you have created.
You can configure each created cue by separately entering the cue's name and number.
You can set up not just one, but multiple target addresses and manage them with a swipe to the left.
Specify the IP and Port for each target. All the settings you customize are automatically saved in the app
