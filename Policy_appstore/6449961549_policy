Frequently asked questions
01
I already have a privacy policy, do I need Privacyboard?
Privacyboard automates the creation and constant updating of your Privacy & Cookie Policies. But if you already have your own policies and want to keep them, you'll still need Privacyboard to comply with the GDPR as our solution helps you collect and manage right requests, automate DPAs signature & monitor subprocessors.
02
Do I need any legal or privacy knowledge to set up Privacyboard?
We've built Privacyboard to make privacy accessible to everybody. Even if you have zero legal or privacy knowledge, you'll be able to use 100% of our features.
03
Why is the pricing monthly/yearly?
Privacy compliance is a recurring activity. You have a legal responsibility to keep all your documents (policies, agreements, contractual clauses...) up to date with the evolution of your business and the changes in legal requirements. Privacyboard also helps you put on autopilot activities like right requests management and legal document signature.
04
Can I use only specific features?
You have the choice to display or not each asset on your Privacy Board. For example, if you already have your own Privacy & Cookie Policies, you can choose to only display your Right Request Forms and your DPA.
05
What am I supposed to do with my Privacy Board?
Your Privacy Board is your dedicated public page for everything privacy related. You only have to add the link of your Privacy Board on your website to let your visitors access the assets you chose to display.
