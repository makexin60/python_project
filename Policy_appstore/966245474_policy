Code of Conduct
CGE games offer a place to interact with other players in several different ways. Players can compete or cooperate based on the specific game and in-game conditions, but we never accept any form of abuse, rudeness, etc.
Communication
When communicating with other players, you are always responsible for your behaviour. You should not use language that could be offensive or rude to others.
Hate speech and discriminatory language are inappropriate. Any form of obscene or disruptive language is forbidden. Threatening or harassing another player is always unacceptable, regardless of the specific language or wording used. Violating any of these expectations will result in account restrictions. More serious or repeated violations will result in greater restrictions.
Naming
Names are subject to the same rules established above. Any name the player has the ability to customize must be appropriate. Any name that violates our standards or disrupts the community will be changed, and additional limitations may be applied.
Take note that acceptable names are determined by player reports and CGE's decision.
Cheating
Cheating in any form will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offence. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.
If you're unsure your actions violate this code of conduct, reconsider them. We reserve the right to restrict offending accounts as much as necessary to keep CGE games a fun experience for all players.

END
Code of Conduct
CGE games offer a place to interact with other players in several different ways. Players can compete or cooperate based on the specific game and in-game conditions, but we never accept any form of abuse, rudeness, etc.
Communication
When communicating with other players, you are always responsible for your behaviour. You should not use language that could be offensive or rude to others.
Hate speech and discriminatory language are inappropriate. Any form of obscene or disruptive language is forbidden. Threatening or harassing another player is always unacceptable, regardless of the specific language or wording used. Violating any of these expectations will result in account restrictions. More serious or repeated violations will result in greater restrictions.
Naming
Names are subject to the same rules established above. Any name the player has the ability to customize must be appropriate. Any name that violates our standards or disrupts the community will be changed, and additional limitations may be applied.
Take note that acceptable names are determined by player reports and CGE's decision.
Cheating
Cheating in any form will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offence. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.
If you're unsure your actions violate this code of conduct, reconsider them. We reserve the right to restrict offending accounts as much as necessary to keep CGE games a fun experience for all players.
