We may also document and audit ad impressions and related data relating to the delivery and display of contextual advertisements.
Personalization
We process certain Personal Data as necessary in connection with our legitimate interest in personalizing our Digital Services. For example, aspects of the Digital Services may change so they are more relevant to you. We may personalize based on Preference Data and your current interactions with the Service, or obtain it from third parties, using Personal Data we hold about you.

Aggregated Data

Profiles
Entertainment is personal, and we are always working to help you find the best concerts, festivals, sports, and other events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend products and services that are personalized to our customers, we may create a “
Profile
” by linking together and analyzing Personal Data processed in the following contexts:
Account Registration
Purchases and Transactions
RFID Products/Digital Tickets
Visiting our Events and Venues
Using our Digital Services
Contest and promotions
Contact Us; Support
Feedback and Surveys
Posts & Social Media
We may augment Profiles with Personal Data that we receive from other AEG Companies, Event Partners or other third parties (including social media companies), e.g. information about Services you have used or purchased previously, Events and Venues you visited, or locations at those Events/Venues, or demographic data and data from your publicly available social media profiles.
In some cases we process Preference Data that reveals Race or Ethnic Origin as part of our Profiles. We typically process this information in relation to marketing for certain Events (e.g. cultural or heritage events.). Depending on applicable laws, we may not collect this information, and we may require your consent before collecting it. We will limit the use and disclosure of your Race or Ethnic Origin according to applicable law. See the “
Regional Supplements
” section below for more information about your rights in Sensitive Data.
We use Profiles for our legitimate interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of customers who have purchased tickets for a future event, and then compare them with other customers in our database. If we identify other customers in our database who have similar Personal Data to the original purchasers, we may direct marketing about that event to the similar customers. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.
Profiles involve processing that is automated, in whole or in part.
Personalized Marketing Communications
We may personalize
Marketing Communications
based on your
Profile
. If consent to Consumer Profiling or Targeted Advertising is required by law, we will seek your consent.
Targeted Advertising
In some jurisdictions, AEG Companies, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in advertising targeted to your interests based on Personal Data that we or those third parties obtain or infer from your activities across non-affiliated websites, applications, or services in order to predict your preferences or interests (“
Targeted Advertising
”). This form of advertising includes various parties and service providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for Targeted Advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from
Personalization
,
Profiles
, and
Marketing Communications
. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a Profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Preference Data, and may track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchased advertised goods or services.
We generally use Targeted Advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, and to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites or social media platforms.
Data Sales
We may engage in “sales” of data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” certain Personal Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors, conduct Targeted Advertising, or we may sell or grant access to Personal Data to our marketing partners, Event Partners, and other advertisers in relation to Targeted Advertising, joint promotions, and other marketing initiatives.

Through your use of our Service, you may direct us to disclose this data to or interact with these third parties, e.g. by attending an Event/Venue hosted, performed, or promoted by an Event Partner, or making a purchase involving these parties (in which cases, such transfers do not involve a data sale by us).

Data Aggregators

Commercial Purposes
and in connection with

, and help ensure that you see advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.
Successors
-We may share Personal Data if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For example, Personal Data may be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction.
Lawful Recipients
-In limited circumstances, we may, without notice or your consent, access and disclose your Personal Data, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you to the extent we believe such disclosure is legally required, to prevent or respond to a crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Use, in the vital interests of us or any person (such as where we reasonably believe the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual or to public health or safety) or in such other circumstances as may be required or permitted by law. These disclosures may be made to governments that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Data as your home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Data to such parties.
If you are located outside the US, we may transfer or process your Personal Data in the US, UK, European Economic Area (EEA), and other jurisdictions where any AEG Companies or our service providers operate.

Global Privacy Control (GPC)
- Our Digital Services may support certain automated opt-out controls, such as
Global Privacy Control
(“GPC”). GPC is a specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as opting-out of the sale/sharing of Personal Data. To activate GPC, users must enable a setting or use an extension in the user’s browser or mobile device. Please review your browser or device settings for more information regarding how to enable GPC.
Please note:
We may not be able to link GPC signals to your Personal Data in our systems, and as a result, some sales/sharing of your Personal Data may occur even if GPC is active. See the “
Regional Supplements
” section below for more information regarding other opt-out rights.
Do Not Track
- Our Services do not respond to your browser’s do not track signal.
We implement and maintain commercially reasonable security measures to secure your Personal Data from unauthorized processing. While we endeavor to protect our Services and your Personal Data against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission or while stored on our systems, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
Our Services are neither directed at nor intended for use by persons under the age of 13 in the US, or under the age of 13 to 16 in the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Other Non-US Countries, or 15/16 in Australia. We generally collect information relating to this age group only from parents or with parental consent and we only knowingly collect Personal Data from such individuals directly in limited circumstances where reasonably necessary to provide the Service (such as registration for age-specific camps or clinics). We do not otherwise knowingly collect information from such individuals. If we learn that we have inadvertently done so, we will promptly delete such Personal Data if required by law. Do not access or use our Services if you are not of the age of majority in your jurisdiction unless you have the consent of your parent or guardian.
We retain Personal Data for so long as it is reasonably necessary to achieve the relevant processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for so long as is required by law. What is necessary may vary depending on the context and purpose of processing. We generally consider the following factors when we determine how long to retain data (without limitation):
Retention periods established under applicable law;
Industry best practices;
Whether the purpose of processing is reasonably likely to justify further processing;
Risks to individual privacy in continued processing;
Applicable data protection impact assessments;
IT systems design considerations/limitations; and
The costs associated continued processing, retention, and deletion.
We will review retention periods periodically and may pseudonymize or anonymize data held for longer periods.
Except for processing by our service providers (described below), this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites, products, or services. For example, we handle some of the purchase process on our Services directly, and third party businesses (such as payment processors) may manage others. Third parties may operate or develop some AEG Companies’ websites and mobile apps, and may operate or host a contest/sweepstakes on our Services. In these cases, the terms, conditions, and privacy practices of the third party - not those of the AEG Companies - may govern your transactions, and we may have no control over the Personal Data collected.
We may change this Policy from time to time. We will post changes on this page. We will notify you of any material changes, if required, via email or notices on our Digital Services. Your continued use of our Services constitutes your acknowledgement of any revised Policy.
