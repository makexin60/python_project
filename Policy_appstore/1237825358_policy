Privacy policy
What information is collected on your device?
All information entered into MongoLime is stored locally and is never transmitted to a third party server. Data such as connection and SSH information as well as saved searches are stored in a MongoLime database on your devices file system. Information remains private between the device, the user (you) and the database server being used.
MongoLime makes use of the Google Analytics Mobile SDK and Fabric Crash Reporter. Metric information collected by Google Analytics is completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you or your databases. These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.
How do we use the analytics information being collected?
Analytics information is used to assess user demographics such as language and demographics. Information such as iOS / Android version and device type is also assessed. This is useful for helping to improve the overall quality of MongoLime. This information is never traced back to an individual since the data is anonymous.
What control do you, as a user, have of the information collected?
MongoDB and SSH connection information is stored in a local database on the device. Removing the information from the device will delete it forever. Connection information is never backed up so when you don't see it on your device you can be sure it doesn't exist.
