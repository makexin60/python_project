When we do so we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom), any other applicable data protection laws. We are responsible as ‘controller’ of that personal information for the purposes of those laws.
This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
We will collect and process the following information about you:

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Information we receive from other sources. We collect most information from you directly as explained above however we may also collect information from publicly accessible sources or directly from a third party. We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers). They may provide the information collected when you visit our sites or otherwise as set out above.
2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner;
For our marketing purposes we would like to contact you by post, email, SMS and telephone about goods and services that we provide that we think you may be interested in and where we have a legitimate interest to do so. We will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) where we have your consent to do so. You can tell us to stop marketing you at any time;
To provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information by post, email, SMS and telephone about other goods or services that we feel may interest you. Where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we will only do this where we are satisfied that there is a legitimate interest to do so and we (or they) will only contact you by electronic means if you have consented to this.

Information we receive from other sources. We will combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).
3. REASONS WE CAN COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
The law on data protection sets out a number of different legal grounds upon which organisations can rely to allow the collection and processing of personal data. We rely on the following as set out below
Consent
In some cases we will specifically ask for your consent to process your data e.g. by ticking a box or confirming verbally that you consent. In these cases we will always clearly explain what we will do with your data and will keep a record of your consent.
Contractual Obligations
In other cases, we will need to use your personal data to actually do what you are asking us to do and to perform our contract with you. E.g. to help with payment or card top up issues we will need your name and card number.
Legal Compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
Legitimate Interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers that we think will be of interest to you and your business. We will also use your address and phone number to contact you with direct marketing information by post and phone, telling you about products and services that we think may be of interest to you and your business.
4. WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH
We share your personal information;
With any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
With selected third parties including:
Business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
Website & app hosts and analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the operation, improvement and optimisation of our site;
We only allow our service providers to handle your personal information if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect your personal information. We also impose contractual obligations on service providers relating to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you.
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.
5. OUR MARKETING
We may use your personal information to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products or services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products or services.
We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information for promotional purposes. This means we do not usually need your consent to send you promotional communications. However, where consent is needed, we will ask for this consent separately and clearly.
We will always treat your personal information with the utmost respect and never sell or share it with other organisations outside the group for marketing purposes. We do however work closely with our payment partner PayPal and from time to time we may carry out joint promotions to offer you discounts or savings or chances to win prizes. These communications may come from us or Pay Pal and whilst we will share information with them relating to the fact that you are a customer of ours, the personal data that they have about you will be information that they already hold as a result of you also being a PayPal customer.
You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by;

6. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Information may be held at our offices and those of our group companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above. (See above “Who we share your personal information with”)
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, and processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These transfers are subject to special rules under the applicable data protection laws as some non-EEA countries (such as the United States of America) do not have the same level of data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA. We will ensure that any transfer to one of these countries complies with data protection law. Our standard practice is to use standard data protection “model” clauses that have been approved by the European Commission. If you would like further information please contact us.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
7. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR
We will keep your personal information while you have a Circuit payment card or Circuit Mobile App Account which you continue to top up with us. Thereafter, we will keep your personal information for as long as is necessary:
To respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf;
To show that we treated you fairly;
To keep records as required by law.
We will not retain your personal information for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of personal information. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.
