Log-Files
Every time you visit our website, we automatically collect data and information from your device's system and store it in so-called server log files. This data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (here: website visitor). The data is automatically transferred by your browser when you visit our website. This includes the following information:
Time of accessing our website (request to the host provider's server),
URL of the website from which you accessed our website,
The operating system you are using,
Type and version of the browser you are using,
IP address of your computer.
The purpose of this processing is to make our website accessible from your device and to enable our website to be displayed correctly on your device or in your browser. The data is also used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
The data is used for statistical purposes. The statistical analysis of user behavior enables us, among other things, to react and optimize our offer as well as to identify security-relevant incidents. Processing for statistical purposes does not result in personal data but aggregated data. These results or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person.
Retention of Your Personal Information
Personal data will only be processed as long as such processing has a legal ground. The storage period may be based on a contract, consent, our legitimate interests or the applicable regulatory enactments (for example, laws on accounting, extinctive prescription, civil rights, etc.).

rental car provider - we are required to send your information to the rental car provider you have booked a rental car services with so that the rental car provider knew who you are and when you are going to use car hire services;
our affiliates (“Affiliates”) for the purpose of providing the transactions you have requested and (with your consent) for marketing purposes;
government authorities;
our service providers and business partners . We will share your information with third parties, such as:
- payment, administrative and technical support providers or our insurance replacement, corporate rental or other customers or partners to facilitate the rental transaction and rewards programs,
- companies who conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys on our behalf,
- communication providers which send email and other marketing and service-related communications to you on our behalf,
- customer support providers, such as the provider of our live chat feature, in order to provide you customer service,
- debt collection providers and claims processors,
- analytics and technology providers for location-based services and to analyze, enhance and manage our data in order to provide, maintain, and improve our services,
- our advertising and marketing partners and third-party media properties, including social media sites, with whom we share aggregated or de-identified information about our customers, to allow them to send targeted advertising messages on our behalf (subject to confidentiality agreements as appropriate).
social media widgets. Our websites may include social media features, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin button. These features may collect your IP address, pages you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
App on Your mobile devices
We offer free apps for a range of mobile devices, as well as versions of our regular website that have been optimized for mobile and tablet browsing. They collect and process your personal data in much the same way as our other platforms do, and they also allow you to find local rental cars based on your current location.
If you agree to it, we can send ‘push’ notifications straight to your mobile device, so you don’t miss important information about your booking. And, if you let us access your device’s location or contact details, we can provide extra services if you request them. Your mobile device will have instructions on allowing push notifications and giving us access to this kind of data.
To give you a better service and more relevant marketing, we may use something known as ‘cross-device tracking’. This just means we look at the way you use our platforms on more than one device: we could, for example, combine data from multiple devices.
To make sure you find deals that are more likely to interest you in our newsletter, we look at the searches you make and the services you book on multiple devices once you’ve signed in to your user account. If you don’t want us to do this, just sign out before you browse, or unsubscribe from our newsletter.
Cross-device tracking can also mean that when you’re using one device, you may see personalized advertisements from lots of different companies, based on your activities on linked devices. The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) should stop this happening if you opt out of the NAI behavioral advertising program (our Cookie Statement gives you the link you need, under “It's your choice: Opting in and opting out”). Please note: simply signing out of your user account won’t stop this happening.
Global Data Transfers and Processing
We operate globally. The information we collect from you, as outlined in this policy, may be accessed from, transferred to, or stored in countries with different data protection laws than those of the country where you initially provided the information. These activities can include dealings with the rental car provider at the location where you rent a car, outsourcing of services to external providers located outside the EU and/or processing the data outside the EU (e.g. cloud computing, web-services, call center support, claims processors).
According to the GDPR, such transfers are allowed when:
The European Commission has determined (“adequacy decision”) that the destination country, territory, sector, or international organization ensures an adequate level of data protection. These are known as "adequate jurisdictions”.
We take the necessary measures to provide appropriate safeguards, such as by including specific European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses.
In the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, transfers are allowed under specific circumstances (“derogations for specific situations”), including, but not limited to explicit consent from the data subject, after being informed of the potential risks.
We shall only transfer personal data to recipients offering an adequate level of data protection. In these situations, as may be required, we make contractual arrangements to ensure that your personal data is still protected in line with EU standards.
