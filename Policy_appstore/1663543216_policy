Privacy Policy
Marcin Czachurski built the Impressia app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Marcin
                    Czachurski at no cost and is intended for use as is.
Impressia does not collect or process any personal information from its users. The app is used to connect to
                    third-party Pixelfed servers that may or may not collect personal information and are not covered by this privacy policy.
                    Each third-party Pixelfed server comes equipped with its own privacy policy that can be viewed through the app or through
                    that server's website.
This policy is effective as of 2023-03-18
