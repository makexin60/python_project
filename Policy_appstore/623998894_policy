I. General information
Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains what data Barco NV and its subsidiaries collect from you, through our products, and how we use that data (“Product Privacy Statement”). Barco NV is a public limited liability company incorporated under Belgian law, with registered office at President Kennedypark 35, 8500 Kortrijk, Belgium (“Barco”).

1. When does this Product Privacy Statement apply?
Barco offers a wide range of products from projectors, display systems, medical devices, wireless presentation systems, video walls, services, and software. References to Barco products in this Privacy Statement include hardware, software and services. This Privacy Statement applies to processing of personal data through Barco Products.
The Product Privacy Statement consists of two parts. In a first general part we explain general information which is applicable to almost any Barco product. Further, in the product-specific sections below we describe our data collection practices applicable to specific Barco products. In case of contradictions between the general privacy information of Barco and the information in a product-specific section, the information in the product-specific section will take precedence.
This Product Privacy Statement does not apply to other processing activities by Barco which are not related to Barco products. In such cases the general Privacy Policy available on our website will
apply
.
2. Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?
Barco products are intended for use by organizations (“end users”) and are administered and controlled by these end users.
When your organization, as an end user, is using a Barco product, your organization is responsible for the processing of these data through the Barco product and is hence the data controller. This means that your organization determines for what purposes and with what means the data are processed. If you as a data subject wish to exercise your rights as described under the last section of this Product Privacy Statement, you will have to address the end user in the first place. In this case Barco will not have the right to directly assist you.
BARCO ACTING AS A PROCESSOR – For some products, Barco processes personal data on behalf of end users; in those cases Barco acts as a processor, e.g. when Barco is managing the hosting environment of the Barco product. In that respect, Barco has created a
“Data Processing Addendum”
or data processing agreement as part the End User License Agreement or the Master Services Agreement, as the case may be, that includes all the terms and conditions applicable to the processing of such personal data by Barco as data processor with the aim to ensure that the Parties comply with the applicable data protection laws.
BARCO ACTING AS A CONTROLLER - In addition to the above, Barco also processes personal data on its own initiative for the purposes explained below, without receiving instructions from the end user. With regard to these processing activities, Barco itself is responsible for processing, and therefore data controller next to the processing activities by the end user. Barco only processes the personal data related to the provision of products and services in limited cases; all these cases are explained in this Product Privacy Statement.
Barco has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who will be your point of contact for any questions regarding this Product Privacy Statement. The contact details of the DPO can be found under point 8 of the general part of this Product Privacy Statement.
3. Which data does Barco process about you?

A ClickShare setup typically consists of these components:
ClickShare base unit is connected to the meeting room display (ClickShare wireless presentation), camera and speakerphone (ClickShare wireless conferencing) and processes all audio and video streams of the connected peripherals, as well as all shared content.
ClickShare button which the user plugs in to his computer to set up the wireless connection to the base unit and exposes the room audio and video as USB devices to the computer.
ClickShare app which can be used with or without the button plugged in to macOS and windows devices, and processes all shared content, whether the full screen or a specific application, as well as the users’ local outlook calendar items, such as meeting title, start and end time, location and conference call links, to show them in the ClickShare app.
ClickShare mobile app which allows the user to share content from iOS and Android mobile devices through a wireless connection with the base unit to the meeting room screen and processes the devices screen content to do so.
Data viewable by people in the room
Any content shared by the host will be visible to all people in the room. If the host shares his full desktop, any pop-ups, reminders or open windows may become visible to everyone in the room.
Any content shared to the meeting room display can be shared to remote participants by the host of the conference call and can hence be subject to snapshot taking (ClickShare conference).
The meeting room audio and video can be shared to remote participants by the host of the conference call and can hence be subject to snapshot taking (ClickShare conference).
Data viewable when joining a session from a remote location
Any content shared to in the conference call by the remote participants is subject to being shared to the meeting room display by the host and can hence be subject to snapshot taking.
The camera video and microphone audio of the personal device of the attendee are subject of being exposed to the participants in the same room as the host.
Data processed by the ClickShare App installed on the user’s device for One Click Join: meeting information from the local Microsoft Outlook client, such as meeting title, start and end time, location and conference call links in order to simplify connecting to the meeting room and joining the conference call. For this purpose the ClickShare App is using the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) to connect to the local Outlook database. This interface allows a local application to access the calendar and meeting details on the computer through the privilege context of the currently logged in user. The accessed meeting information is only displayed to the user on his computer. No data is stored locally (in logs or cache files) nor does any of this data leave the user’s device. The ClickShare App only parses meeting time, subject, location and join links.
Feedback star rating after using the ClickShare App: Barco only gets access to the number of stars and optional feedback given when rating the ClickShare experience after having used the App. No personal data is being processed. This star rating is used to measure the global satisfaction level of the ClickShare experience and to measure if new features and improvements have the expected impact. The optional feedback is used to identify specific improvement opportunities for the ClickShare experience.
Microphone usage to detect a user presence in the meeting room (PresentSense):
The ClickShare Desktop App and the ClickShare Mobile App use the ultrasound signals (inaudible to the human ear) emitted by the ClickShare Base Units to detect when a user walks in a ClickShare equipped meeting room, in order to help the user to connect to the ClickShare Base Unit instantly. The ClickShare Apps filter out all non-ultrasound frequencies. No audio is kept after use, nor is it sent to Barco. The ClickShare Desktop App and the ClickShare Mobile App only use the ultrasound signals when they’re running on the users device.
