This Notice covers all the work of the Jesuits in Britain. In this Notice, references to 'we' and 'us' mean the British Province.
1.2 When you provide us with Personal Data to engage with us and/or benefit from our activities, we will keep a record of the Data you give to us to enable us to comply with the statutory obligations and to achieve our charitable objects.
1.3 For the purpose of the
UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018,
the Province through its Trustees will be a Data Controller in respect of your Personal Data. In some cases, the Province may be a joint Data Controller of your Personal Data (e.g. Data shared between the Province and another organisation for a particular purpose). Please be aware that our parishes and Works form part of the Province and are not separate legal entities. Parishes and Works are not Data Controllers but they may process Personal Data on behalf of the Province as a Data Processor.
1.4 Everyone has rights regarding how their Personal Data is handled by organisations. The Province is committed to ensuring that Personal Data is properly and securely managed in accordance with the relevant data protection laws, and believes this is an important part of achieving trust and confidence between the Province and those with whom it interacts. Please read this Notice to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or that we obtain or hold about you, and to understand what are your rights are in relation to information that we hold. This Notice applies to information about living identifiable individuals only.
II WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE HOLD ABOUT YOU?
2.1 We may hold the following types of Personal Data from staff, volunteers, supporters, school alumni, users of our Apps and prospective and current members of the Province:
2.1.1 name and contact details;
2.1.2 gender, age, date of birth, marital status and nationality;
2.1.3 information about your education, work history, professional qualifications;
2.1.4 information about your family and any dependants;
2.1.5 information about your current involvement in Province activities and events;
2.1.6 financial information and details of any donations you have made to us in the past;
2.1.7 information obtained as a result of any background checks on volunteers or current or prospective staff;
2.1.8 CCTV recordings, video streaming and photographs;
2.1.9 information we collect through your use of our website(s) and Apps such as IP addresses and other information collected using cookies; and
2.1.10 any other information which you choose to provide to us or that we are provided by others.
2.2 We may also hold Special Categories of Personal Data e.g. information about your religious beliefs, information about your health and wellbeing, information revealing racial or ethnic origins, information concerning your sexual orientation or in the case of background checks, information about criminal records or proceedings.
2.3 We may also receive Personal Data about you from third parties, for example, your family members, friends, other religious bodies, medical professionals, the police and other law enforcement bodies.
III HOW AND WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
3.1 The Personal Data which we hold about you, whether it is collected directly from you or whether we receive it from a third party, may be processed in several ways, for example:
3.1.1 to communicate with you in relation to news about or activities / events taking place in the Province and informing you of any changes in our activities;
3.1.2 to improve our activities and the way we communicate with you including our websites.
3.1.3 to carry out our pastoral and spiritual activities.
3.1.4 to process donations that you may make to us or other payments where necessary;
3.1.5 to administer, support, improve and develop the administration of the Province’s work and operations, and to keep the Province’s accounts and records up-to-date;
3.1.6 to Process applications from you, such as becoming a member of the Province / Society, or for a role within the Province;
3.1.7 to help us to improve our fundraising and find potential sources of additional funds, by gathering information about our alumni, supporters and potential supporters, either information that they have shared themselves or that is publicly available from sources such as for example, Companies House, the Electoral Register, Who’s Who, company websites, published information, social networks such as LinkedIn, political and property registers, and news archives, which we use to help tailor our messages and requests. Through building relationships with supporters, we understand their ‘vocation’ in giving, i.e. which aspects of our work, if any, they feel called to support; this makes our fundraising as effective and efficient as possible, which is something supporters tell us is very important to them. Supporters and alumni can ask us not to use their data in this way by emailing data@jesuit.org.uk or by calling 020 7499 0285;
3.1.8 for audit, statistical purposes;
3.1.9 to ensure we comply with our legal obligations (e.g. by providing information to the Charity Commission or HMRC or carrying out safeguarding activities);
3.1.10 in case of CCTV recordings, to prevent or detect crime, and to help create a safer environment for our staff, parishioners, Jesuits and visitors.
3.1.11 to livestream Masses and other church celebrations to assist those who cannot attend. These may be viewed via the internet anywhere in the world.
3.2 Any information gathered through cookies and similar technologies via the Province website or our other websites, is used to measure and analyse information on visits to the website, to tailor the website to make it better for visitors, and to improve technical performance. We will not use the data to identify you personally or to make any decisions about you.

XII GLOSSARY
"Data Controller" (the Province) means a person, organisation or body that determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any Personal Data is processed. A Data Controller is responsible for complying with the data protection laws including the GDPR and establishing practices and policies inline with them.
"Data Processor" means any person, organisation or body that Processes personal data on behalf of and on the instruction of the Province. Data Processors have a duty to protect the information they process by following data protection laws.
"Data Subject" means a living individual about whom the Province processes Personal Data and who can be identified from the Personal Data. A Data Subject need not be a UK national or resident. All Data Subjects have legal rights in relation to their Personal Data and the information that the Province holds about them.
"Personal Data" means any information relating to a living individual who can be identified from that information or in conjunction with other information which is in, or is likely to come into, the Province’s possession.

It can even include a simple email address or photographs where the individuals can be identified. A mere mention of someone's name in a document does not necessarily constitute Personal Data, but personal details such as someone's contact details or salary (if it enabled an individual to be identified) would fall within the definition.
