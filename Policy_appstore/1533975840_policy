This policy explains how Magnite, Inc. (“
Magnite
,”
we
” or “
us
”) collects, uses and discloses information about you when you interact with Digital Media Properties (defined below) that use our advertising technology platforms and related services to deliver you ads (collectively, the “
Services”)
.
This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of information about visitors to our
website
, or (ii) information collected in the course of our sales and marketing activities. Our privacy practices as to that information can be found
here
.
This policy also does not govern the collection, use and disclosure of information by our clients through their Digital Media Properties, the activities of other third parties we may work with, or any activities where we act as a service provider or processor to our clients rather than a data controller. Those practices are governed by our clients’ own privacy policies.
About Us
Magnite offers Services that connect buyers of advertising inventory (which we refer to as advertisers) with sellers of advertising inventory (which we refer to as publishers), providing such buyers with the opportunity to display an advertisement on a seller’s Digital Media Property. In this policy, we refer to our buyers and sellers collectively as “
Clients
”. Our platform is used to deliver digital advertising inventory on websites and applications across Internet-connected devices and platforms, including mobile devices, computers and internet-connected TVs (which we collectively refer to as “
Digital Media Properties
”).
How We Collect User Information
We (and our service providers) use different technologies (collectively “
Tracking Technologies
”), including cookies and other similar technologies to collect information automatically from your device when you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our technology.
When doing so, we collect certain information about you and your device (collectively, “
User Information
”). User Information does not include information that directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, or email address. However, the User Information we collect is considered “personal data” or “personal information” under applicable privacy and data protection laws.
In particular, we collect information such as your IP address, cookie data, and other device identifiers, and may also assign new identifiers to your device or browser based on this data and other device-related information we collect as described in more detail
here
. These identifiers help us to recognize a particular device without knowing the identity of the user of that device. This helps us, our Clients, and our partners (such as third party advertising platforms) select appropriate advertisements to display to you.
Information Our Clients and Vendors Collect Independently
We collaborate with various third-parties for analytics and advertising services, which independently gather and use User Information. These third-party services provide our Clients with additional ways to deliver targeted ads using our technology.
For example, third-party companies may use data about your visits to Digital Media Properties across multiple devices or browsers to create advertising profiles that allow advertisers to deliver more personalized content and ads. Our advertiser clients can combine this data with the information we collect to deliver targeted ads or create audience segments for advertising on Digital Media Properties. Our Clients and their vendors may use their own tags, pixels, cookies, or similar technologies within ads and on certain third-party platforms and Digital Media Properties. We are not responsible for the tracking technologies or privacy practices of our Clients or their vendors.
Please review our
Platform Cookie Statement
for more information.
Use of User Information
We and our Clients use User Information to guide decisions on buying and selling advertising space on Digital Media Properties. This data, which may also be combined with information from third-party services, helps deliver targeted ads that our Clients believe will interest specific users. When an ad is shown on a publisher’s site, it may also be targeted based on the content that you are viewing or have viewed, for example a travel ad appearing on a travel site. Tracking Technologies help to match client’s advertising opportunities with the right advertisements. To do so, we may perform cookie syncing between Clients, Magnite, third party data provider and/or advertiser client cookies. This cookie synching process allows the parties to map their respective cookie information. For example, if publisher A sets a cookie on a user’s device with an ID 12345 and advertiser B sets a cookie on the same user’s device with an ID 67890, cookie synching would enable publisher A and advertiser B to recognize that ID 12345 and ID 67890 relate to the same user’s device. In the case of advertisers, cookie syncing may influence the decision whether to bid on a specific advertising opportunity, because if an advertiser recognizes a given cookie ID it may place a higher value on that opportunity.
We also use these technologies to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, enhance ad delivery, report to clients, and assess ad effectiveness.
This processing may constitute “targeted advertising” under some laws and the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information under other laws.
Cooperation with Clients in the European Union
In the European Union, we and our Clients may act in limited circumstances as joint controllers under the GDPR for the collection of User Information on Digital Media Properties. In this case, this joint controllership is limited to setting and collecting identifiers and User Information on the Digital Media Properties and transmitting this information to us (“
Joint Processing
“). Further processing of your information is our sole responsibility and we act as an independent controller.
We have put contractual arrangements in place with our Clients that set out the distribution of responsibilities between us and our Client. Accordingly, our Clients establish the necessary legal basis for this Joint Processing by obtaining consent on the Digital Media Properties and providing the required transparency information. We and our Clients cooperate to fulfill our obligations under the GDPR, especially regarding collaboration with data protection authorities.
If you wish to exercise your rights under the GDPR concerning Joint Processing, please contact us via the
User Choice Portal
.
