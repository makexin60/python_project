HOW WE PROCESS, SHARE, AND RETAIN YOUR PHOTOS AND IMAGE DATA
‍
We process your selfie photo to deliver the personalized features of our App. Upon uploading a selfie to our App,, we utilize cloud-based technology to process this photo, focusing on identifying facial features (“Face Data”). This enables us to create AI-generated photo avatars, transforming your image into various popstar personas for song covers. Below is an explanation of how we process, share, and retain your selfie and the corresponding Image Data in relation to the functionalities of our App. We store the original photo to which we apply the AI transformation on our servers for no longer than 30 days after your subscription expires, upon which time the original photo will be deleted. Note that we may keep your data for longer periods if necessitated by legal requirements.
Photo Transformation: Your uploaded selfie undergoes transformation on our cloud servers, where technology is applied to generate Image Data. This process is central to our app's functionality, allowing us to swap your face into different popstar images for your song covers. The generated Image Data is stored on our servers.
Song Cover Artwork: The AI-transformed images, derived from your selfie, serve as customized song cover artwork. This artwork, along with your Face Data, is securely stored on our servers. We maintain the selfie and the resulting Image Data only until you decide to delete your account on our App. Following the deletion of your account, your selfie and all associated Image Data are permanently erased from our servers.
Song Distribution: Should you opt for song distribution, the AI-generated song cover artwork is shared with our third-party music distributor. This step is essential for disseminating your songs, with the accompanying image, to platforms like Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, etc. We require your explicit consent for this sharing, which is an optional feature of our service.
Accessibility and Deletion of Artwork: Your AI-generated song covers are accessible within our App at any time from any device you use to log into the app. They remain available until you opt to (i) delete the song covers or (ii) delete your account. Requests for deletion of either the song covers or your account are typically processed within 2 business days. It's important to note that removing our App from your device does not automatically result in the deletion of your account.
