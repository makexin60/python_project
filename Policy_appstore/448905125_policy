Data Protection Information Notice - Biometrics
Data Protection Notice
1. Introduction
This data protection notice provides information about the processing of your personal data when you use the Star Alliance Biometrics Hub (SBH) via the Star Alliance app (our App). The SBH creates a secure, integrated identity profile that allows you to elect to be biometrically identified at checkpoints of certain airports and airlines that are our partners (Travel Partners). For more information concerning the processing of your personal data when you use other features of our App or our website, please refer to the applicable
Privacy Policy
.
Use of the SBH is never mandatory. It is intended to facilitate your travel experience should you choose to use it.
2. Controllers
The joint Controllers for the processing of your personal data in the SBH are
Star Alliance Services GmbH
(HRB Frankfurt: 50030)
Frankfurt Airport Center I
Hugo-Eckener-Ring
60546 Frankfurt/Main
Germany
and
Star Alliance (SG) Pte Ltd
One George Street #13-04/05
Singapore 049145
Singapore
References to Star Alliance, we or us include these two entities. According to Article 26 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), we have agreed on joint controllership arrangements. These require that both companies jointly and severally ensure compliance with the GDPR and all other applicable data protection laws. They must, to that end, cooperate and align on each other’s responsibilities.
The Travel Partners act independently from us, they do not operate the SBH and do not have access to your biometric data. You can find out more about the Travel Partners
here
.
3. Details of processing your personal data
We process your data for the following purposes:
Creation of your SBH profile
Storage and management of your SBH profile in our App
Use of your SBH profile to authenticate or identify you
Technical improvements, troubleshooting and customer support
The lawful basis for the activities a.-c. is your consent to the processing of your personal and biometric data (Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR). The lawful bases for activity d. are our legitimate interest in handling and responding to your requests and improving our services, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and compliance with legal obligations, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.
Below, we list separately for each purpose the affected data categories, the retention period, and the recipients of the data.
a. Creation of your SBH profile
When you enrol to the SBH via the SBH module in our App, we ask you to provide personal information to create your personal SBH profile.
Categories of personal data
Video stream and picture of your face
Selection of your preferred airline
Passport data, meaning your passport image, your first and last name, your date of birth, your nationality, and the passport expiration date
Retention period
Except for the SBH profile (see below), your data is not retained.
Recipient
The data is partially processed by Star Alliance and by our service providers NEC Deutschland GmbH and NEC Corporation of America, and by their technical service providers.
b. Storage and management of your SBH profile in our App
To protect your privacy, your SBH profile is stored only locally on your smartphone in encrypted form. You can manage your SBH profile in our App, which requires prior biometric authentication.
Categories of personal data
Your SBH profile contains the following data:
A picture of your face
First and last name
A UUID (unique user ID), which is a number that is assigned to each SBH profile
A code indicating your preferred airline
Retention period
The SBH profile is retained on your smartphone until you delete it. You can do this by selecting this option in our App, by deleting our App, or by destroying or disposing of your smartphone (or the data on it, for example through a factory reset).
Recipient
The SBH profile is stored on your smartphone and leaves it only when you request to be authenticated or identified using our service; for more details see below.
c. Use of your SBH profile to authenticate or identify you
The SBH can be used to identify or authenticate you during your travels. This happens only (i) if you request biometric identification for a specific flight or (ii) whenever you log into the SBH module on our App.
To request biometric identification for a specific flight in our App, you can prior to the flight connect your boarding pass with your SBH profile. Your SBH profile and boarding pass data are then sent from your smartphone to our systems to enable identification. At the airports, within the specified checkpoint areas, a picture of your face is taken and transferred to our systems. In our systems, we then create two single-purpose biometric templates (which are mathematical representations of your facial characteristics), one from the picture in your SBH profile and one from the picture taken at the checkpoint, and compare them. If you are positively identified, we send the boarding pass data to the relevant Travel Partner to confirm your eligibility to pass through the checkpoint.
If you log into the SBH module on our App, you are authenticated using it in the same way, but in this case, you take the authentication picture via the smartphone camera.
Categories of personal data
Your SBH profile data
Biometric templates generated from the picture in your SBH profile, from the pictures taken at the airport checkpoints, and the picture you take during log-in to the SBH module
Video streams taken during the log-in to the SBH module
Boarding pass data, including your first and last name
Retention period
When your SBH profile and the boarding pass data are used to enable biometric identification for a specific flight, they are stored in our systems for the time in which you can be identified at the airport checkpoint. The data is deleted shortly after the scheduled departure time of the flight.
All other data is processed only in transient memory and not retained.
Recipient
The data is partially processed by Star Alliance and by our service providers NEC Deutschland GmbH and NEC Corporation of America, and by their technical service providers. In case of a positive identification, we transfer your boarding pass data (but no biometric data) to the corresponding Travel Partner.
In checkpoints that can be used by users of other biometric identification services, your pictures taken at these checkpoints and the biometric template generated from them will also be used by other biometric providers to distinguish their customers from you. Only we will be able to identify you. Shared checkpoints, and the providers using them, are listed
here
.
d. Technical improvements, troubleshooting and customer support
We also process your data to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the SBH, improve our services and to respond to customer requests. No biometric data is used for this purpose.
Categories of personal data
Data provided by you in the request such as your contact information and any further information you provide to us
Data Logs about the use of the SBH
Data about helpdesk requests and how they have been resolved
Retention period
Log and helpdesk data are retained for appropriate retention periods. The data are thereafter automatically deleted.
Recipient
For data logs: NEC Deutschland GmbH and NEC Corporation of America, and by their technical service providers.
For helpdesk data: Nagarro GmbH, Baierbrunner Strasse 15, 81379 Munich, Germany.
4. Transfers of personal data to third countries outside of the EU
Personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area. If the European Commission has not formally found that these countries ensure an adequate level of data protection (adequacy decision), we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the transfer of your personal data to these countries.
If you choose to be identified for a flight operated by Swiss International Air Lines AG (Swiss) we transmit your boarding pass data to companies established in Switzerland, therefore outside of the EU. The European Commission has decided that Switzerland ensures an adequate level of protection (2000/518/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000).
While our back-end system is hosted in the EU, technical support services are provided from other countries outside of the EU as well. To the extent our providers are not certified under the EU/US Data Privacy Framework or other adequacy decisions, they are subject to appropriate safeguards to provide an adequate level of data protection, e.g. by standard contractual clauses. You can request a copy of these safeguards under
privacy@staralliance.com
.

Right to object to our processing of your personal data under Article 21 GDPR
You have the right under Article 21 GDPR to object to the processing of personal data concerning you at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation. We must then refrain from further processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms.
Right to withdraw your consent
You have the right to withdraw your consent with effect for the future at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.

Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.
You can also contact the supervisory authority into whose jurisdiction we fall:
The Hessen Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
Gustav-Stresemann-Ring 1
65189 Wiesbaden
If you wish to exercise your rights, please contact us via the contact details mentioned in paragraph 2 or 7 of this notice.

This data is not in operational use anymore but remains a part of the SBH profile on your smartphone as long as you keep it. You can delete it as described in section 3.b. or re-enroll to the SBH and create an updated SBH profile. Your old SBH profile remains usable but we do not process the above-mentioned data.
