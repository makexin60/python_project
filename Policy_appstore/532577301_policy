Binding Corporate Rules
Binding Corporate Rules
Rakuten’s global privacy framework is based in a set of internal rules referred to as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). This all-encompassing framework of internal rules is comprised of both the EU BCR and the UK BCR, which have been approved by the European Union and the United Kingdom’s respective data protection authorities. The BCRs ensure the protection of individual’s privacy and personal data throughout the Rakuten Group.
Why are the BCRs important?
The fast-moving and globalized nature of the digital sector requires a global approach to business operations, where services are available to individuals located all over the world. The Rakuten Group, as a global company, is established in several countries and its operations are the subject of a vast number of laws in multiple jurisdictions.
Some of these countries have limited or fragmented privacy rules or may lack a general privacy framework. Therefore, Rakuten relies on its BCRs as the fundamental guarantee and operational baseline for its approach to privacy and data protection.
These corporate rules assure that the level of protection offered in any country where Rakuten companies are based matches the level required by the European Union and the United Kingdom. This means that data can be transferred safely and lawfully between Rakuten Group entities.
What is the content of the BCRs?
These rules comprise the main privacy principles such as lawful processing, purpose limitation and data quality, as well as recognize the right to information, rectification, objection, and other rights as granted under the applicable privacy laws. Depending on the region where Rakuten users are based and the applicable privacy regulations, users may also enjoy additional rights.
Rakuten has appointed a Global Privacy Manager that leads Rakuten’s privacy strategy.  The Global Privacy Manager works hand in hand with Rakuten’s strong privacy network to ensure compliance with the BCRs across Rakuten Group entities, and they are responsible for mediating claims and assuring internal compliance. Most importantly, the BCRs bind all Rakuten’s worldwide entities so that each company adheres to the same rules across all their operations.
The rules also make it clear that even if personal data is transferred to a country that operates on a less stringent data protection regime, Rakuten will still apply its high global standards.
Privacy is the core value of trust for our users and stakeholders. Rakuten is very serious about maintaining global compliance to the highest standards.
