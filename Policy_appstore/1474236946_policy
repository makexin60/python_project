”) at the time you create your Account and
									select the term of your subscription (each, a “
Service Commencement
										Dat
”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are
									non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and TV CAST APP for the Services
									until TV CAST APP or the Payment Provider, for example Apple or Google, accepts your
									order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of
									communication.
6.4 Taxes.
TV CAST APP’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Service, or payments for
									any Service, are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted
									the applicable Sales Tax to TV CAST APP, you will be responsible for the payment of such
									Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and
									you will indemnify TV CAST APP for any liability or expense we may incur in connection
									with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts
									issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence that you have
									paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “
Sales
										Tax
” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by
									sales proceeds, that TV CAST APP its permitted to pass to its customers that is the
									functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does
									not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
6.5 Automatic Renewal.
Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the
									Terms.
After your initial subscription period, and again after any
										subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on
										the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement
										Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at TV CAST APP’s
										then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be
										subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at
										least 24 hours prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going
										to the “Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App Store or the “My Apps”
										page in the Google Play Store app. The same page will permit you to change your
										Account settings if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or
										if you want to change or terminate your subscription.
If you cancel your
									subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current
									subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current
									term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion
									of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period. By
									subscribing, you authorize TV CAST APP to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at
									the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your
									subscription, if TV CAST APP does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i)
									you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree
									that TV CAST APP may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to
									attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of
									payment, your Account will be re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal,
									your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was
									received).
6.6 Pre-purchased Minutes and Texts.
Users of the Telephony Service may be able to purchase calling minutes and text
									messaging packages (collectively, “
Pre-Purchased Packages
“).
									Pre-Purchased Packages are not legal tender and cannot be reloaded, resold,
									transferred for value, redeemed for cash or applied to any other account, except to
									the extent described herein or as required by applicable law. TV CAST APP prohibits and
									does not recognize any purported transfers of Pre-Purchased Packages outside of the
									Telephony Services, or the purported sale, lease, gift or trade in the “real world”
									of anything that appears or originates outside of the Telephony Services.
									Accordingly, you may not trade, sell or attempt to sell Pre-Purchased Packages for
									“real” money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside the
									Telephony Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void,
									and will subject your Account to termination. You shall ensure that you have
									sufficient Pre-Purchased Packages in your Account before you initiate any
									transaction that requires such credits. If you have insufficient Telephony Credits
									in your Account to complete the transaction, the transaction will be cancelled. ALL
									TRANSACTIONS MADE USING Pre-Purchased Packages ARE FINAL AND ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.

									OR NOT TV CAST APP HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO
									CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TV CAST APP BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY TV
									CAST AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING
									THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT YOU CLAIM. IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID TV CAST APP ANY
									AMOUNTS DURING SUCH PERIOD, TV CAST APP’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED
									TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).
THE TELEPHONY SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO SUPPORT OR CARRY EMERGENCY CALLS OR SMS
									MESSAGES TO ANY EMERGENCY SERVICES. NEITHER TV CAST APP NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE
									UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE OR LOSS ARISING FROM OR

									SERVICES.
9. Remedies

									that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those TV CAST APP
									Properties to which your access has been terminated. In the event that you violate
									the immediately preceding sentence, TV CAST APP reserves the right, in its sole
									discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without
									any notice or warning to you.
10. Miscellaneous Legal Terms.
10.1 Electronic Communications
The communications between you and TV CAST APP use electronic means, whether you visit
									the Website or send TV CAST APP e-mails, or whether TV CAST APP posts notices on the Website
									or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) agree to
									receive communications from TV CAST APP in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all
									terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
									that TV CAST APP provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
									communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not
									affect your statutory rights
10.2 Release
You hereby release TV CAST APP and its successors from claims, demands, any and all
									losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries,
									death, and property damage of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of
									the Terms or your use of the Website, the Application, the Software or the Service.
									If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section
									1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
									does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release,
									which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
10.3 Assignment
The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned,
									subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without TV CAST APP’s prior
									written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer
									in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
10.4 Force Majeure
TV CAST APP and its licensors shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
									resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to,
									acts of God; war; terrorism; riots; embargos; acts of civil or military authorities;
									fire; floods; accidents; strikes or shortages of transportation facilities; fuel;
									energy; labor; materials; problems with your computing or network infrastructure,
									hardware or product; problems with your internet service provider (ISP) or any sites
									you are attempting access through the VPN Service; or any electrical or other
									utility outages.
10.5 Dispute Resolution
(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
										relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount
										of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may
										be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based
										arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall
										be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider
										(“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under
										the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
										with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and
										the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR
										Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
										(1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely
										based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
										initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
										English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the
										parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties; and (4)
										any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
										of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
										attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay
										an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the
										foregoing, TV CAST APP may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its
										intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note
										that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from
										California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought,
										exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the
										international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are
										applicable to your use of the TV CAST APP Properties.
(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable)
										shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential
										arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not
										any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one
										commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial
										contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association
										(“
AAA
”). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed
										upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s
										Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the
										Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively
										“
Rules and Procedures
”).
(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your
										rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights
										will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are
										entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE
										LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable
										as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
(d) You and TV CAST APP must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY
										YOU OR TV CAST APP MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
										PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING;
										(ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT
										OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY
										NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate
										that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
										litigation, TV CAST APP will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
										connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
										arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation;
										(iv) TV CAST APP also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to
										assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the
										arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi)
										the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the
										existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by
										law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the
										arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are
										permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees
										and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing
										party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance,
										the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.
(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in
										the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than
										English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or
										true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator
										shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
										findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
										of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages
										in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 8 of the
										Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of
										competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any
										temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and
										equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an
										injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be
										final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted
										by California law or United States federal law.Notwithstanding the foregoing,
										either you or TV CAST APP may bring an individual action in small claims court.
										Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
										and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright,
										trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
										Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located
										in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this
										agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before
										the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, in
										order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit
										to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San
										Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures
										shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a
										class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed
										to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules
										and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
										effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
										unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If,
										however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal,
										then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and
										neither you nor TV CAST APP shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a
										claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be
										exclusively brought in state or federal court in San Francisco County,
										California. By using the TV CAST APP Properties in any manner, you agree to the
										above arbitration provision.

									claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at

10.6 Choice of Law and Venue.
The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and
									under the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of
									laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state. You
									hereby expressly agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and
									federal courts for the county in which TV CAST APP’s principal place of business is
									located for any lawsuit filed against you by TV CAST APP arising from or related to the
									Terms.
10.7 Notice.
Where TV CAST APP requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for
									providing TV CAST APP with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last
									e-mail address you provided to TV CAST APP is not valid, or for any reason is not
									capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Terms, TV CAST APP’s
									dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
									notice. You may give notice to TV CAST APP at the following address: 178 Castro St., San
									Francisco, CA 94114. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by TV CAST APP by
									letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class
									postage prepaid mail at the above address.
10.8 Waiver.
Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not
									be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other
									occasion.
10.9 Severability.
If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or
									unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the
									invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and
									enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

									subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to
									enforce them.

									investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property
									infringement claim to the extent required by the Terms.
(f) You and TV CAST APP acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are

									to enforce the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application
									against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

									applicable third party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced
