Help and Useful Information:
How much will delivery of my items cost?
At present we are offering customers discounted prices and free postage and packing service for UK mainland orders, however overseas orders will be subject to postage and packing charges based on charges levied by Royal Mail and other international carriers.
Do your prices include VAT?
We do not charge VAT on our books, however we do charge VAT on Calendars and eBooks, this will be added to your basket and shown clearlyÂ at checkout.
What cards do you accept?
We accept the following major Credit Cards:
MasterCard, Visa, Visa Electron, Delta, Solo, Maestro
What payment provider do you use, and are my credit card details safe?
All transactions use the Shopify Payments payment system. You can trust that your details are safe, secure and not stored on our system once transactions have been processed.
When will I be charged?
When you reach the final billing page and press 'Proceed to secure payment' you will be taken to the Shopify Payments secure payment screen. Once you have entered your details Shopify will immediately contact your bank / card issuer for authorisation to take payment from your account.
If the payment is authorised, you will receive an e-mail within a few minutes confirming your order and payment will be taken from your account shortly afterwards.
If payment is authorised but we have a query with your order, an e-mail will be sent to advise you of the nature of the query. If we are unable to resolve the query for any reason and cannot dispatch your order, a full refund will be issued back to your card.
Are my personal details safe?
Yes, we promise to keep your personal details safe and will not pass them onto third parties or send you any unsolicited emails or promotions.
