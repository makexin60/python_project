Credit Privacy Disclosure Statement
1. Collection of your personal information and credit-related personal information
Up is a brand of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, ABN 11 068 049 178, AFSL and Australian Credit Licence 237879 (“we”, “us”, and “our”).
Tiimely Pty Ltd ABN 41 605 696 544 is our service provider and assists us in relation to the loan application, assessment and settlement processes, and collects, uses and discloses your personal information on our behalf.
We collect your personal information and credit-related personal information to assess your application, to provide you with the product or service that you have requested and to assess any future applications for products or services you may make to us or our related entities. We may also use the information you provide to better tailor our products and services to you. If you are a guarantor we collect your personal information and credit-related personal information to assess whether to accept you as a guarantor for credit applied for, or provided to, the borrower.
Collection of some of this information is required by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.
We use an automated digital identity verification process provided by GBG which involves the collection and use of biometric information in the form of a selfie, which is only used for the purpose of verifying your identity against your identity documents. You need to provide a separate consent to your identity being verified in this way (which is the first step of the process when we refer you to GBG). You can request an alternative method for verifying your identity by contacting us on 1300 992 700.
If you provide incomplete or incorrect information we may be unable to provide you with the product or service you are applying for.
As part of the application process, we will need to verify your identity. If you choose to use our automated digital identity verification process which involves you taking a photograph of your face (a “selfie”), you consent to us collecting and using your related biometric information for the purpose of verifying your identity. If you don’t, you will need to verify your identity using an alternative method. You can request an alternate method for verifying your identity by contacting us on 1300 992 700.
2. Collection of personal information and credit-related personal information about third parties
We may need to collect personal information and credit-related personal information about a third party from you as part of this application. If we do this, you agree you will advise that person that we have collected their information, and that in most cases they can access and seek correction of the information we hold about them.
3. Use and disclosure of your personal information and credit-related personal information
We may use your personal information and credit-related personal information to perform our business functions (for example internal audit, operational risk, product development and planning). We may also use your personal information to confirm your details (for example contacting your employer to confirm your employment and income details).
We treat your personal information and credit-related personal information as confidential and only disclose it to others where necessary. For example, we usually disclose your information to organisations to whom we outsource functions such as mailing and printing houses, IT providers, our agents and specialist advisers such as accountants and solicitors. Other disclosures usually include joint account holders, account operators and account applicants, Credit Reporting Bodies (as defined below), insurers, intermediaries, valuers, debt collection agencies and government authorities. Your information may also be disclosed to our related entities, our joint venture partners and Community Bank® companies where its confidentiality is maintained at all times.
4. Disclosure of personal information and credit-related personal information to overseas organisations
Some of the organisations we disclose your personal information and credit-related personal information to may be located overseas. Where an organisation is located overseas we will either take reasonable steps to ensure that it complies with Australian privacy laws or we will seek your consent to the disclosure.
5. Access to and correction of your personal information and credit-related personal information
In most cases you can gain access to and seek correction of your personal information and credit-related personal information. Should you wish to do so, or if you have any queries about your information, please contact us on 1300 941 461.
