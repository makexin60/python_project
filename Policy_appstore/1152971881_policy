Apart from the right to withdraw your consent, as mentioned above, your rights include:

the right to seek restriction of personal data processing.
If, despite the fact that we adhere to the adequacy principle, that is we process only data that is necessary to achieve a given processing goal, you consider that for a specific purpose we process too wide catalogue of your personal data, you have the right to request that we restrict (limit) the scope of processing.

This right, also known as the right to be forgotten, means that you can demand that we remove any information that contains your personal information from our systems and any other records.

Allowing this, your data we need to keep in line with applicable law, will be available only to a very limited group of people in our organization;

In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, you can ask us to port the data you provided to us in the course of all our contacts and all cooperation to a separate file, for the purpose of further transfer to another data controller;
the right to object to personal data processing.
You submit the right to object when you do not want us to process your personal data for a specific purpose (for example for marketing purposes). In evaluating an objection, we’ll evaluate several factors, including: reasonable user expectations; the benefits and risks to you and third parties; and other available means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportional effort; if you are under the age of majority in your country and have a limited ability to enter an enforceable contract, we will take particular account of the fact that you are below the age of majority and adjust our assessment of our legitimate interests and the balancing of your interests and rights accordingly. Should your objection be deemed justified, we will continue to process your data for other processes (for other purposes), but not for the purpose for which you objected. In any case, your objection will be upheld and we will cease processing your information, unless the processing is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons.
You may exercise all of your rights by sending an e-mail to
contact@medizzy.com
or by post to the following address: Craven House, Ground Floor, 40-44, Uxbridge Road, London, United Kingdom, W5 5TH, with the note “Personal Data”.
