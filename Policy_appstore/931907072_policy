A Passenger with a disability requiring any special assistance should inform the Carrier at the time of his or her booking of his or her special needs. The Carrier will carry such a Passenger where arrangements have been made to provide
                    for that Passenger’s special needs. If such a Passenger does not inform the Carrier at the time of booking of his or her special needs, the Carrier will nevertheless use reasonable efforts to accommodate that Passenger’s
                    special needs. Passengers with disabilities who have advised the Carrier of any special requirements they may have at the time of booking, and been accepted by the Carrier, shall not subsequently be refused carriage on the basis of
                    such disability or special requirements, but the Carrier’s regulations or government regulations may apply to the transportation of such Passengers.
The Carrier may require that a Passenger with a disability travels with his or her own Assistant if it is essential for safety or that Passenger is unable to assist in his or her evacuation of the aircraft or is unable to understand safety
                    instructions.
The Carrier will refuse to transport, or will remove at any point, any Passenger whose actions or inactions prove to the Carrier that his or her mental or physical condition is such as to render him incapable of caring for him or herself
                    without assistance, unless he or she is accompanied by an Assistant who will be responsible for caring for him or her en route and, with the care of such an Assistant, he or she will not require unreasonable attention or assistance
                    from the air crew.
The Carrier reserves the right to require a medical clearance from medical authorities if travel involves any unusual risk or hazard to the Passenger or to other persons (including, in cases of pregnant Passengers, unborn children).
Passengers with a disability will not be permitted to occupy seats in designated emergency exit rows or in over-wing emergency exit rows.
The Carrier reserves the right to cease accepting Passengers who must travel on a stretcher on any flight.
The Carrier will not refuse to carry passenger wheelchairs or other disability-assistive devices, unless such carriage would be inconsistent with safety or safety requirements. In addition to the regular free baggage allowance, the Carrier
                    will accept such passenger wheelchairs or other disability-assistive devices as priority checked baggage without charge.
5.0 Refusal To Transport
The Carrier may reserve the right to refuse to transport or may remove from any flight any Passenger for any reason, including but not limited to the following:
Government Request or Regulations - whenever such action is necessary to comply with any government regulation or to comply with any government regulation, or to comply with any governmental request for emergency transportation in connection
                    with the national defense, or whenever such action is necessary or advisable by reason of weather or other conditions beyond its control (including but without limitation, acts of God, or events of force Majeure, strikes, civil commotions,
                    embargoes, wars, hostilities or disturbances) actual, threatened or reported.
Search of Passenger or Property – if a Passenger refuses to permit search of his person or property for explosives or a concealed, deadly or dangerous weapon or article.
Proof of Identity/Age – If a Passenger refuses to provide proof of age or identity as requested by the Carrier, the Carrier may, at its discretion and at any time, refuse to transport the Passenger. In addition, when a Passenger
                    is traveling on a fare which has a particular age requirement for qualification, proof of age may be required. Acceptable forms of proof of identity are a valid driver's license, birth/baptismal certificate, passport or provincial
                    health care card. Failure to provide proof as requested constitutes grounds for refusal to transport.
Travel Documentation Requirements – The Carrier will refuse to transport any Passenger, where in the Carrier’s opinion:
the travel documents of such Passenger are not in order;
such Passenger's entry into, transit through or embarkation or any other point would be unlawful.
Passport must be valid at least 6 (six) months.
Passenger's Conduct/Behavior – The Carrier may impose sanctions on any person who engages in or has engaged in any conduct or behavior on the Carrier's aircraft, or to the knowledge or reasonable belief of the Carrier, on any airport
                    property or other Carrier’s aircraft, that the Carrier determines, in its reasonable judgment, may have a negative effect on the safety, comfort or health of that person, Passengers, the Carrier’s employees or agents, aircrew
                    or aircraft or the safe operations of the Carrier’s aircraft (the “Prohibited Conduct”).
(a) Examples of Prohibited Conduct that could give rise to the imposition of sanctions include:
significant impairment arising from the consumption or use of alcohol or drugs prior to boarding or while on board an aircraft of the Carrier
engaging in belligerent, lewd or obscene behavior toward a Passenger or employee or agent of the Carrier.
threatening, harassing, intimidating, assaulting or injuring a Passenger or employee or agent of the Carrier

unauthorized intrusion or attempted intrusion onto the flight deck of an aircraft.
smoking or attempted smoking in an aircraft
swearing or carrying dangerous or deadly weapons on aircraft (other than on duty escort or peace officers who have complied with the Carrier’s guidlines)
The sanctions the Carrier may impose on a person may be any one or combination of the following :
(b)
Written or verbal warning;
refusal to permit boarding of an aircraft
removal from an aircraft at any point;
requiring the person, to undertake in writing to refrain from repeating the Prohibited Conduct in question and from engaging in any other Prohibited Conduct as a prerequisite to further travel with the Carrier during the probationary
                            period that will not normally exceed one year;

                    to carry the passenger or his baggage hereunder or perform any other service incidental to such air carriage. “WARSAW CONVENTION” means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage
                    by Air signed at Warsaw, 12th October 1929, or that Convention as amended at The Hague, 28th September 1955, whichever may be applicable.
Carriage hereunder is subject to the rules and limitations relating to liability established by the Warsaw Convention unless such carriage is not "international carriage" as defined by that Convention.
To the extent not in conflict with the foregoing carriage and other services performed by each carrier are subject to: (i) provisions contained in this ticket, (ii) applicable tariffs, (iii) carrier's conditions of carriage and related
                    regulations which are made part hereof (and are available on application at the offices of carrier), except in transportation between a place in the United States or Canada and any place outside thereof to which tariffs in force in

                    opposite the first abbreviation of carrier's name in the ticket; the agreed stopping places are those places set forth in this ticket or as shown in carrier’s timetables as scheduled stopping places on the passenger's route;

8.0 Passports And Visas
Responsibility of Passenger
Each Passenger desiring transportation across any international boundary shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary travel, health and other documents required by laws, regulations, orders, demands or requirements of the countries
                    to be flown from, into or over and for complying with the laws of each country from, through or to which he desires transportation, and unless applicable laws provide otherwise, shall indemnify the Carrier for any loss, damage, or
                    expense suffered or incurred by the Carrier by reason of such Passenger’s failure to do so. The Carrier shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of the Carrier to any Passenger in connection
                    with obtaining such documents or complying with such laws, whether given orally or in writing or otherwise; or for the consequences to any Passenger resulting from his failure to obtain such documents or to comply with such laws.
Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Passenger shall pay the applicable fare whenever the Carrier, on Government or immigration authority order, is required to return a Passenger to his point of origin or elsewhere due to the
                    Passenger's inadmissibility into or deportation from a country, whether of transit or of destination. The fare applicable will be the fare that would have been applicable had the original ticket designated the revised destination on
                    the new ticket. In such circumstances the Carrier will not refund any fare to the Passenger for flights with the Carrier that the Passenger is unable to fly for these reasons. If the Carrier is required to pay or deposit any fine or
                    penalty or to incur any expenditure by reason of the Passenger’s failure to comply with laws, regulations, orders, demands or other travel requirements of the countries to be flown from, into or over or to produce the required
                    documents, the Passenger shall on demand reimburse to the Carrier any amount so paid or expenditure so incurred or to be paid. The Carrier may apply towards such payment or expenditure the value of any carriage unused by the Passenger,
                    or any funds in the Carrier’s possession.
9.0 Advice To International Passengers On Limitation Of Liability
Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire journey, including
                any portion entirely within the country of origin or destination.
For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and
special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers
                parties to such special contracts for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed US $75,000 per
passenger* and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negl igence
                on the part of the Carrier.
For such passengers traveling by a Carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the Carrier for death or personal injury to passengers
                is limited in most cases to approximately US $10,000 or US $20,000.
The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such
                insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage. For further information, please consult your airline or insurance company representative.
*Note: The limit of liability of US $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in the case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of
                US $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.
NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
:
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid.
For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately US $9.07 per pound (US $20.00 per kilo) for checked baggage and US $400.00 per passenger for unchecked baggage.
For travel wholly between U.S. points, Federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least US $1,250.00 per passenger. Excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of articles.
Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier.
