Our website uses cookies to recognise you when you visit and use the site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the site (for example, certain cookies help to remember your preferences or items that you have placed in your 'basket' on the site) and also allows us to improve the site. Other cookies help us to tailor online advertising based on your interests and behaviour on our website and across the internet. For more information on the cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and ways to limit the use of cookies and similar technologies in relation to your browsers or devices, please see our
Cookie Policy.
Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, and we also collect your IP address or other device identifier (this enables us to recognise your computer or device when you use the site) via our server log files.
If you visit one of our premises to collect a Click and Collect order, we will ask you for a form of identification which shows your full name, such as a bank card or driving licence. This is so that we can verify that the parcel you are collecting has been ordered by you.
As a merchant, if you visit one of our premises, or if we visit you at your premises, we may process your personal data. This personal data may include: your name, job title, employer, postal address, e-mail address and phone number (including mobile number). We may also ask to see a form of photo identification to verify your identity.
We conduct checks as part of our onboarding process for new businesses/merchants. If we are onboarding you as a new business/merchant, we will ask you to provide a form of photo identification to verify your identity. Our warehouse inspector will either have a video call with you to match you to your photo or visit your premises in person to verify the match. .
From other sources:
We may also receive your data from 3rd parties:
We may collect data from the merchants who advertise their products or services on our site, for example about your redemption of any voucher that you buy from us or if we provide delivery services to the merchant whereby we post the products to you on behalf of the merchant;
We work closely with third parties providing services to us (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors providing technical, payment and delivery services related to the goods or services we provide to you, advertising networks, social networking platforms, analytics providers, search information providers) and we may also receive information about you from them;
If you enter sweepstakes, special offers or contests sponsored by us or one of our business partners including email addresses from publishers who work through the following agencies - We Breathe Media, eGentic and Lead365. These publishers include but are not limited to the following:
Aldanti International Network
All Groove
Affiliads
Dalma Media
Massive Ads Digital Limited (Datastars)
Submission Technology Limited
My Offers / PDV
Marketing Punch / Offerx
Luna Park Media
In some circumstances related to a particular transaction, we may obtain data from public databases or credit reference agencies; and
We may combine information that we collect about you from other sources with the information that you give to us directly. We may use this combined information as described in this policy;
C.	How do we use personal data, and what is our justification for doing so?
We use your personal data for a variety of purposes related to the products and services that we provide.
We collect your data for the reasons listed below
The provision of products and services offered to you:
to provide you with the information, products and services (including vouchers) that you request or purchase from us (i.e. to complete certain tasks, processes or orders on our website or within our apps, take payment online (where applicable) and deliver your products or services), and to communicate with you regarding those products and services (including vouchers) that you purchase from us and respond to your questions and comments; and
to measure customer satisfaction and provide customer service (including liaising with merchants to troubleshoot in connection with your purchases or your requests for services).
We use your data in this way either because we have a contract with you (for example, if you purchase a voucher from our site, a contract to provide that voucher to you) or because it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for example, it is in our interests to measure customer satisfaction and 'troubleshoot' customer issues) but we will always ensure that your rights are protected.
For advertising and marketing purposes, including to measure how effective our marketing is:
to contact you with daily or weekly emails to let you know about products and services we offer (and that the merchants who advertise on 
                        our sites offer) that we think you might be interested in based on your subscribed location and other preferences on your account, we may 
                        also combine this with information we collect from other sources to ensure we are only telling you about products and services which would 
                        interest you;
to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and our advertising (i.e. so that we can tell what interests our customers and what 
                        doesn't);
for information on how we use cookies, please see our cookie policy;
We rely on your consent to contact you directly about the products and services on offer on our site (for example, we will send you Daily Deals emails based on your consent). In other scenarios, we will rely on our legitimate interests as a business, always ensuring that your rights are protected. If you have agreed to receive marketing, you may always opt out at a later date. You have the right to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your data to other members of our group. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purpose, then please visit our email preference centre, a link to our email preference centre is included in the footer of every email that we send you.
For administrative and internal business purposes:
to ensure that content on our site is presented in the most effective and relevant manner for you and for your device and to tailor the site's experience and content based on the way that you use the site;
to administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
for our internal business purposes, such as analysing and managing our businesses, audits, developing new products or services, enhancing our site, improving our services and products and identifying usage trends.  For these purposes, your personal data will be aggregated and looked at on a statistical basis;
It is in our legitimate interests as a business to use your data in this way.  For example, we have a clear interest in ensuring that our site works properly and that our products and services are high quality and efficient. We will always ensure that your rights are protected.
For security and legal and compliance purposes:
as part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure;
to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity;
as we believe to be necessary or appropriate in each case in order to comply with laws or legal process (including laws or legal process in other countries);
to protect our rights or property (or the rights or property of others) and to enforce our rights and pursue available remedies;
In some cases, we will need to use your personal data to fulfil a legal obligation (for example, if we receive a legitimate request from law enforcement agencies), and in other cases (such as the detection of fraud or ensuring the security of the site, for example by verifying the identification of merchants before permitting access to our premises)  we will rely on our legitimate interests as a business to use your data in this way.
International transfer of your data:
some of the processes involved in our use of your personal data may require your data to be stored or processed in countries outside of Europe.
Whenever we send (or permit a third party to send) your personal data outside of Europe, we will make sure that we take steps necessary to protect your data as required by applicable laws.  For example, we may implement specific contract terms or we may rely on service providers who adhere to certain compliance programmes overseas, or we may select service providers based in countries with strong local laws to protect your personal data.
D.	How do we share your personal data?
We will never sell your personal data to third parties. Your personal data is only shared with trusted third parties for a specific reason, such as to facilitate payments, to enable the sending of emails to customers and suppliers, or to manage our sales process or the provision of customer services to you. The various ways in which we will share your data are set out below:
Sharing data within our group:
We are part of a group of companies that share various operations and business processes.  We may share your personal data with any member of our group in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, or because it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for example, our legal function is provided by another group company which means that your personal data may be shared with our lawyers who are based in another group company).
We may also disclose personal data to other companies in our group (which includes LivingSocial Europe Limited) and may use and share with those companies any information we learn from your interactions with us and from other companies in our group. Subject to acquiring your consent, you may be contacted by other companies in our corporate group by email, telephone, SMS and/or post with information and offers within the group.
Sharing with merchants of the products and services we offer:
We host offers on behalf of third party merchants on our website and, as such, we will share some information about you with the merchant when you purchase a voucher from us to be redeemed against the product or service offered by them. In almost all cases, this is because such sharing is necessary in connection with our performance of our contract with you, and in some other cases it may be in our legitimate interests to do this since this enables us and the merchants to provide you with competitive offers for a range of products and services and to prevent fraud.  This also helps improve the services we and the merchants offer to you.
When you redeem a voucher with a third party merchant, you will be entering into a separate contract with that third party merchant and, in these cases, your personal data will be collected by the third party merchant and not by us.  You should also read the third party merchant's privacy policy to make sure that you understand how they may use your data.  In some instances the third party merchant may share some of your personal data with us for example to evidence that your order has been placed or if they ask us to provide redemption or delivery services for them. To ensure you get the best serice, if a third party merchant informs us that they are no longer able to fulfil your order after you have redeemed your voucher, we might share your information with an alternate trusted merchant who is able to provide you with the same or similar goods or services.
Sharing with organisations providing services to us:
We engage various third parties to provide services to us for specific functions, and this will often mean that we need to share your personal data with them (it is in our legitimate interests to do so, since we may not have the capabilities to provide these services ourselves).  In each case, we will ensure that these third parties are only allowed to use your personal data in order to provide the relevant services to us.  We will always make sure that we use organisations that we trust to look after your personal data appropriately and as required by applicable laws.
Some examples of these third parties will include: credit card processing services, order fulfilment, analytics, website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, WhatsApp messaging supplier, auditing, and other similar services.
In some cases, we may use a third party payment service such as PayPal to process purchases made through the site. In these cases, your personal data will be collected by the payment provider on our behalf, and not by us. You should also read the payment provider's privacy policy to make sure that you understand how they may use your data.
Sharing data with online advertising related service providers:
We may from time to time work with online advertisers, social media platforms and advertising networks to deliver, tailor and measure advertising to you and others both on the site and elsewhere on the internet (including on social media platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, Tiktok, Pinterest and Twitter).  We also use various tools and products which involve the sharing of data with Google (
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB
), Vonage (
https://www.vonage.com/legal/privacy-policy/
)  Facebook (
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php

), Pinterest (
https://policy.pinterest.com/ms/privacy-policy-2016
), TikTok (

) to deliver, measure and tailor our online advertising.
The personal data that we allow to be shared with these third parties includes online identifiers such as IP address, data from cookies or similar technologies, or other device related information.
Similarly, we may share certain online identifiers with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site.
You can choose not to allow your data to be used to deliver targeted advertising by changing your settings within social media platforms, or as described in the third party privacy policies set out above.
Sharing data in connection with changes to our group structure or the ownership of our business:
If we sell or propose to sell our business or part of it, we may need to disclose your personal data to prospective buyers.
Similarly, if there are changes to our group structure or if our ownership changes, we may need to disclose your personal data to the new owners or operators of this site or any of our apps as part of that process.
Sharing data to comply with laws:
There may be scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to disclose or share your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies or public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime.
3.	Security and retention of your personal data
Security of your personal data:
