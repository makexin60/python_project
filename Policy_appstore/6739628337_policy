Our website has detected that you are using an unsupported browser that will prevent you from accessing certain features.
We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the most recent version of your browser.
This Privacy Policy applies to the worldwide websites and mobile applications of TE Connectivity Corporation which is part of the TE Connectivity plc family of companies (“TE”), and its global affiliates (together: “TE”, “we”, or “us”). It explains how we collect, process, share, secure and store personal information (information and data that can be used to identify an individual) of our websites' users and the users of our mobile apps. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. TE is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us or that we collect during your visit to our websites or through the use of our mobile apps (“Personal Data”).
Use of Our Websites and Mobile Apps
In general, you can visit our websites without telling us who you are or revealing Personal Data. During your visit to our websites, we collect certain information automatically, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser, device type, domain, host names, pages viewed and viewing patterns, as well as the country/region where users are located. This information allows us to better determine user needs and interests to drive improvements to website content and functionality, and to enhance the overall customer service experience.
When you download and use one of our mobile apps you will need to provide certain Personal Data that is required to make the mobile app work and enable its features. The service providers that run our mobile apps may also provide their own privacy policy, but as the data controller, TE is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data when using a TE mobile app.
Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data / Consent
We collect, process, and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary for the following primary purposes:
Website Registration
Request for Information Regarding Product/Service
Website Features and Updates
Product/Service Enhancements and Information
Webinar/Training Registration
Survey Participation
Live Chat Support and use of Chatbot

Marketing Purposes
Enabling the download and use of a TE mobile app and the various functions it provides which may include the use of the camera of your device or collecting its location.
Personal Data collected from you may include your name, address, telephone number, title/position, company, mailing address, e-mail address, or billing information among other information. Usually, the Personal Data you voluntarily provide will only be used to respond to an inquiry you make or to process your request, e.g., to fulfill a legal obligation or a quasi-legal obligation with you. You may refuse any request for Personal Data. However, if you choose not to provide certain Personal Data, you may not be able to take advantage of certain TE mobile application and websites features.
When you create an account on this website, we ask for your consent to collect, use and process your Personal Data for marketing and advertising purposes, i.e., to contact you by phone or email to inform you about our products and services, offers and news. We also ask for your consent to transfer your Personal Data to TE in the United States, to any TE subsidiary or affiliate worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf. These uses are in addition to other legal ways we use to protect Personal Data in case of international transfer as discussed below. You may revoke your consent and ask us to delete your Personal Data at any time as described in the Contacting Us section below.
We use the Microsoft Clarity (Clarity) analytics tool for the needs-based design of our websites. Clarity creates usage profiles on the basis of pseudonyms. In particular, pseudonymized usage data (e.g., clicks, access times, pages visited), movement data (e.g., scrolling movements, mouse movements), location data and metadata (e.g., IP address, device information) are processed for this purpose. In this way, we are able to recognize returning visitors and count them as such.  As part of the Clarity service, Microsoft Corporation supports us as a processor in accordance with GDPR Art. 28. Data processing may also be carried out by Google outside the EU or the EEA (in particular in the USA). With regard to Microsoft, an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed on the basis of the adequacy decision (EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework). Microsoft also undertakes to conclude standard contractual clauses with other sub-processors.  Clarity enables user analysis on the basis of a pseudonymous user ID and thus on the basis of pseudonymous data, such as the evaluation of data on mouse movements or performance data on certain Internet presentations.  In particular, we process usage data (e.g., Internet presentations visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g., device information, IP addresses), location data (information on the geographical position of a device or person), movement data (mouse movements, scrolling movements) in pseudonymized form. We have made the corresponding settings in such a way that the data collection to and by Microsoft alone is pseudonymized, in particular in the form of IP masking (pseudonymization of the IP address).  All users of our website who have consented to the corresponding use via our cookie consent service are affected by this data processing. The data processing is therefore carried out solely on the basis of your consent in accordance with GDPR Art. 6 para. 1.  The purpose of the processing is tracking (e.g., interest/behavioral profiling, use of cookies), remarketing, conversion measurement (measurement of the effectiveness of marketing measures), interest-based and behavioral marketing, profiling (creation of user profiles), reach measurement (e.g., access statistics, recognition of returning users), cross-device tracking (cross-device processing of user data for marketing purposes).
Exchange of Personal Data
We share your Personal Data with our distributors, including information we collect via automated data collection tools on our website (see below under “Cookies”), as required to process your orders, instructions, or provide you with information or services related to TE products. We also share Personal Data with service providers for data processing activities such as data storage and analysis and when you use the TE Store for the execution of your payment and the delivery of your order.
We contractually require all third parties, including our subsidiaries, to adequately safeguard your Personal Data and not use it for any other purpose than for which it was collected. We will only release your Personal Data if you direct us to do so or if we are required by law to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or to defend our legal rights. We may also need to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security, law enforcement requirements, or in other limited circumstances as required by the law (including fraud protection and risk reduction).
We may also share your Personal Data in the event of a sale of all, or a portion of our business, stock, or assets that relate to your Personal Data.
International Data Transfers
To provide adequate protection for the international transfer of Personal Data, TE uses the EU standard contractual clauses. These agreements provide an adequate level of data protection and are in place both with our service providers who process Personal Data from countries with data transfer restrictions as well as with TE affiliates that transfer or process such Personal Data. We are using the current version of the standard contractual clauses for our agreements and will implement the use of updated versions as they become available. For data transfers from non-EU countries, we will comply with jurisdiction specific privacy laws and regulations.
Cookies
We use automatic data collection tools, including cookies, web beacons, e-tags and Javascript, to obtain information when your web browser accesses the websites. These tools allow us to recognize your computer or other device and your customized preferences when you visit and use our websites. The tools, including web analytics provided by third parties, gather data including but not limited to browser type, IP address, and clickstream patterns (pages viewed and links clicked). You can read more in our
Cookie Policy
including on how to manage your cookie preferences.
We partner with third-parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, visit
https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
Links to Other Websites
TE's websites may contain links to other websites. While we make reasonable efforts to try to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted on all websites you use/access.
Children's Privacy
Our websites are not intended for persons under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children. If we learn we have collected Personal Data regarding a child under the age of 16, we will delete that Personal Data.
Security of Collected Personal Data
TE maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized or inappropriate access, accidental or intentional manipulation, loss and destruction. Our security procedures are continually enhanced. We restrict access to your Personal Data to those workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action. However, the security of the internet cannot be guaranteed. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacyoffice@te.com
.
Data Retention. Accessing, Amending, Storing Your Personal Data and Opt Out Rights
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you services. Upon request TE will provide you with information about whether we hold or process any of your Personal Data. You may review and update the Personal Data that you provide to TE through our websites, or request to have your Personal Data amended, blocked, or removed by contacting us as described below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable, or any legally required, timeframe. If you request removal of your Personal Data, you understand and agree that residual information may continue to reside in TE's records and archives as far as permitted by law (e.g., for accounting purposes). However, we agree not to use such Personal Data for business purposes.
You may opt out of the collection and processing of your Personal Data or from the  onward transfer of your Personal Data to TE affiliates or third parties at any time by contacting us as described below. We will ask for your prior consent if we would like to use your Personal Data for a materially different purpose than for which it was collected or authorized.
You may sign-up to receive newsletters via email from us for which we will use technology to check their effectiveness. You can “unsubscribe” to any online contact from us at any time by following the instructions set forth on the email message, or by contacting us as described below.
If you remove a TE mobile app from your electronic device all Personal Data will be removed as well. With some delay this will apply as well for the systems we, or our service providers use for operating the mobile app.

These agreements provide an adequate level of data protection and are in place both with our service providers who process Personal Data from countries with data transfer restrictions as well as with TE affiliates that transfer or process such Personal Data. We are using the current version of the standard contractual clauses for our agreements and will implement the use of updated versions as they become available. For data transfers from non-EU countries, we will comply with jurisdiction specific privacy laws and regulations.
