Security
We have established both physical and electronic procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, the internet is an open system, and we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information submitted to the Platform. For this reason, we recommend that you use anti-virus software, routine credit checks, firewalls and other precautions to protect yourself from security and privacy threats.
Third Party Websites
The Platform may contain links to other websites that we believe may be of interest or use to you. We provide these links solely as a convenience to you. Links may be also posted by other users of the Platform. When accessing a third party website through our Platform, you acknowledge that you are aware that these third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by us. Please note that our Privacy Policy and information collection, use and sharing procedures do not apply to other websites. We take no responsibility for and incur no liability for other websites’ collection, use or sharing of information. Please review the privacy policies provided by each website linked to the Platform to familiarize yourself with the procedures of such websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, do not create rights enforceable by third parties.
Law Enforcement
You agree that we may disclose your information to authorities if compelled to by a court order. Additionally, you agree that we may disclose your information if we reasonably believe that you have violated any laws or the terms of our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy or if we believe that a third party is at risk of bodily harm. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, where your actions violate any law of the United States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, the Platform, or our Terms of Service. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants. We may release your information under the conditions listed in this paragraph whether it is to individuals or entities and to any state or national authorities, as required.
Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications
If you decide to provide us with your contact information, you agree that we may send you communications and emails. However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying Wiseport Ltd that you no longer wish to receive such communications. Once notified, we will endeavor to remove you from our database immediately. If you wish to opt out of certain communications, please contact us at

Third Party Access to Your Information
Through our Privacy Policy you agree to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others to help provide our services through the Platform. For example, we use Service Providers to assist in securing your personal information.
Throughout the course of our provision of our services to you through our Platform, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services for the purpose of providing service to you or for operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our Platform or its underlying files or systems. As we do not control these third parties, you agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
Your California Privacy Rights
Wiseport Ltd permits residents of the State of California to use its Service, and complies with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. Although we do not disseminate your information to third parties without permission, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us at app@lolaspeak.com with any questions.
Cooking and Tracking
Cookies are little bits of code that help identify you when you use our Platform. We may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or other tracking mechanisms through our Platform to identify you and to remember your preferences. If you have any questions regarding the tracking mechanisms we use please contact us at app@lolaspeak.com. We currently do not subscribe to any do-not-track listings.
Amendments
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will modify the date listed on this Agreement and we may contact you. You must agree to the amendments as a condition of your continued use of the Platform. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using the Platform and notify us of your refusal to agree by e-mailing us at app@lolaspeak.com.
