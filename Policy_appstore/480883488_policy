A. Information We Collect.
We may collect the following types of information when you use the Platform.
Information you provide.
When you sign up for the Platform, we ask you for some basic personal information, such as your name, email address, and Academic Institution. You may update or change your account or profile information through the Platform at any time. When you use the Platform, you may provide additional personal information at your sole discretion, including subject interests and grade level interests. As part of an Academic Institution, others in your Academic Institution and linked Academic Institutions may see your personal information and technology reviews.
If you are a Technology Provider, we may collect information from you concerning your Educational Tools. Any information you provide concerning the Educational Tools may be shared with other users of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Similar Technologies.
We use cookies to help us understand how individuals utilize our Platform and to help us improve the quality of our Platform, including for storing user preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how individuals use our Platform.
When you access the Platform we automatically record certain information, such as your web request, your interaction with the Platform, IP address, browser type, browser language, device type, operating system, and device ID. We use this information for troubleshooting and security monitoring.
As you interact with the Platform, we obtain information regarding your interactions, such as time of day and date, how long you spend on different pages; some of this information is collected via cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use this information to understand how your hardware and software interacts with the Platform and how we can better improve usage of the Platform.
If you or your Academic Institution have installed our extensions to your browser, we may automatically record certain information while the extension is activated, such as your username, the websites you visit, and the amount of time spent on each site. The extension records only application or website information on products that are included in the Platform’s product library as described below.
User Communications.
When you send communications to us or to other users through the Platform, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Platform. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our Platform, including service-related notices.
B. Integrated Metrics Producing Analytics on Classroom Technology (IMPACT) Data
This section applies only if your Academic Institution uses IMPACT. The IMPACT module of the Platform (“
IMPACT
”) is an optional tool that integrates data from multiple sources including student demographic information, product usage, and student achievement data to produce evidence-based reports and dashboards on product effectiveness. The data used in IMPACT are defined, approved, and controlled by the Academic Institution using IMPACT, and usage of IMPACT only happens at the direct instruction of -- and via direct involvement with -- the Academic Institution. IMPACT does not use any data collected via browser extensions. All data used for IMPACT are used only for the specific educational purpose defined by the Academic Institution.
C. How We Use and Share Information
We use information we collect to administer the Platform, to allow you and other users to use the Platform and to improve our Platform and as otherwise described above in Section 10.A. We will disclose information to our service providers that work on our behalf as described in Section 4.A., to provide the Platform.
Certain information and the reviews that you post to the Platform will be shared through the Platform and will be accessible to other users of the Platform. Please note once you have posted information to the Platform or communicated with another member of the Platform, we cannot control how other users may use the information you provide. Additionally, your Academic Institution may have access to your information, including as posted to the Platform, and may use such information in accordance with the Academic Institution policies.
Our Technology Providers do not have access to data you provide us or data we collect unless you expressly initiate such a request or expressly consent to such disclosure. If given permission, our Technology Providers may provide information about their educational tools and respond to requests from users.
If you are a Technology Provider and are using the Platform to respond to a request for proposal ("
RFP
") from an Academic Institution, we may collect the information you submit through the Platform and share that information with the designated Academic Institution.
We may use the information you provide through the Platform in response to RFPs in an aggregate and de-identified manner to provide aggregated and statistical data about such responses to our users and schools.
We may also create aggregated and statistical data about our users and/or Academic Institution and the use of the Platform. We may share or provide aggregated and statistical data, including reviews, to Academic Institutions, educational organizations, or Technology Providers.
We may also use de-identified or aggregated information to improve the Platform, including by sharing such information with our third-party collaborators and partners.
D. Platform Extensions
If you use the browser extension portion of our Platform, the Platform will collect information relating to your use and interactions with various websites accessed through your Chrome browser or your iOS device. Because the explicit purpose of the extensions is to help our customers understand how educational tools are used in their environments, the extensions collect general information only when you use sites related to educational tools that are listed on the Platform and included in the product library. You can review whether the extension is collecting information as follows:
Chrome Extension:
When the Chrome extension is grayed out in your browser, no information is being sent to the Platform. When the Chrome extension is colorized, you are on a website that is part of the product library, and general information is sent back to the Platform.
iOS Extension:
When you are on an application or website that is not part of the Platform product library, no information is being sent to the Platform from the iOS extension.
The information collected through the extensions is not used to identify an individual student and is used only in aggregated form. For Academic Institutions that have a paid subscription to the Platform, the names of individual teachers can be listed on a per Academic Institution basis. We do not otherwise track or collect personal information about your online activities once you leave the Platform.
