TERMS OF SERVICE - TEACHERS & ORGANISATIONS
Teachers are not allowed to join RNH for their school when purchasing an individual license. Should a teacher wish to join the Academy they must do so via purchasing a school corporate license and not as a dancer.
Where a teacher joins RNH as an individual they must do so as a dancer and this means they are required to complete all practical sessions of the Academy and show their progression before they can progress to the next week/phase.
The RNH
content is designed to be completed outside and away from a dancers main dance lesson to improve progress as a whole. It is not designed to form part of a dancers dance lesson and therefore any school who are deemed to be including RNH ACADEMY LTD training in class without having purchased the correct license to do so will face legal action.
Individual License
When you purchase RNH as a dancer you are purchasing one individual license and therefore no part of RNH may be distributed or given out to anyone else.
All RNH content is owned by RNH ACADEMY LTD and protected by copyright laws. Therefore any user deemed to be passing on RNH content to others will face immediate legal action for damages and losses incurred to RNH ACADEMY LTD.
Multiple Users
If several users are found to be using the same login details for one user then the account will be closed immediately, no refund will be given and legal action will be taken for the damages and losses that RNH ACADEMY LTD have incurred.
Teacher & Organisation License
Any teacher that is wanting to join RNH to distribute Academy training to the school is required to purchase a corporate business license that will cover the teacher and the dancers connected to that school only. All users must meet the required age specifications and are still prohibited from distributing any content to those not included in the school corporate license.
