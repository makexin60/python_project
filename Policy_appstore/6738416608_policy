Mobile Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
At ThinkR, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to user data collection, which is simple:
our mobile apps do not collect any data.
Data Collection
Our mobile apps are designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or process any personal information, usage data, or other forms of identifiable or anonymous data.
Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party services that collect or process data. Your experience with our apps is entirely self-contained, and no information is shared with external entities.
Data Security
Because we don’t collect or store any data, you can rest assured that there’s no risk of your personal information being accessed, shared, or misused.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in our app or to address legal requirements. Any updates will be posted directly within the app or on our website, if applicable.
