Purpose:
SPOTTERON provides smartphone applications, web applications, websites and media for partners, based on the service of the SPOTTERON platform and as associated media like video, animation or data visualization or homepages for projects and initiatives.

For users like yourself, the SPOTTERON platform enables you to actively participate in such projects by providing geo-located data points (aka “spots”) or answers in questionnaires in apps or in interactive web-applications and to be part of a topic related community.
The apps and software on the SPOTTERON platform are designed for sharing observations, user interactivity, for participating in projects and to create communities in topic related environments.
