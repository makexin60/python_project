              the Polymail website and system, an all-in-one email platform for
              sales outreach, tracking, and automation, in a system that
              provides real-time insights on messages, outreach automation, and
              instant meeting scheduling. The Polymail system is designed to
              help sales teams reach, engage, and track prospects more
              effectively with email.
This Privacy Policy (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) applies to your access
              and use of https://polymail.io/ (the ‚ÄúSite‚Äù) and the
              software and services available on the Site or offered by us or
              our subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúCompany Services‚Äù or the
              ‚ÄúServices‚Äù).

              transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States.
We will make references
to you throughout this Policy as ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù or the
              ‚ÄúUser.‚Äù This Policy expressly discloses: (i) the types
              of personal or non-Personal Data collected as a result of your use
              of the Site and the Services; (ii) how such data is used and

Who Do We Collect Data From?
We collect data from three groups of people:
Visitors:
People who visit our website and who may request information
              about our Services
Users:
Users are customers that pay to use our Services
Contacts:
a Contact is a person a User may contact through our
              Services from a distribution list or database maintained and
              operated by a User (‚ÄúData Contact List‚Äù).
This policy covers how Polymail handles Personal Data.
              ¬†‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù means any information relating
              to an identified or identifiable natural person. It can be names,
              e-mail addresses, age, location, whether user is outside the
              United States, education, or even an IP address.
Privacy Principles
We understand email communications can be both informative and
              intrusive, so we take privacy very seriously. ¬†That‚Äôs
              why we adhere to the US-EU and US-Swiss Privacy Shield Framework
              Principles:
Notice ‚Äì
We tell you what information we collect, how we use it, how our
                Users use it and when and how we share it.
Choice ‚Äì
We will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out)
                whether their Personal Data is (a) to be disclosed to a third
                party (other than our third party processors), or (b) to be used
                for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally
                collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
Accountability for Onward Transfers
. ¬†We take steps to gain assurances from our processors
                that they will safeguard Personal Data consistent with this
                policy and take steps against to stop disclosure in violation of
                this policy.
Security.
We will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data in
                our possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
                disclosure, alteration and destruction
.
Data Integrity & Purpose Limitation.
We will use Personal Data only in ways that are compatible with
                the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently
                authorized by the individual. We will take reasonable steps to
                ensure that Personal Data is relevant to its intended use,
                accurate, complete, and current.
Access.
Upon request, we will grant individuals reasonable access to
                Personal Data that we hold about them, and we will take
                reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or
                delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or
                incomplete.
Resource, Enforcement And Liability.
We will conduct compliance audits of our relevant privacy
                practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that
                we determine is in violation of this Policy will be subject to
                disciplinary action up to and including termination of
                employment. ¬†We also have procedures for dispute resolution
                and binding arbitration in certain cases where a data subject
                believes that we have not complied with the law with respect to
                the application of our privacy policy.
How Do We Collect Personal Data?
We collect information in two ways
Information you give us.
In connection with your use of certain features of the
                Service, we may ask for Personal Data, like your name, email
                address, telephone number or credit card. If you elect to use
                our Salesforce integration service, we will have access to all
                of your Salesforce data (including leads, contacts, accounts,
                tasks, activity, user, and schema data).
Information we get from your use of the Service.
We collect information about the features on the Service
                that you use and how you use them and if you receive
                communications, we receive information on what you do with the
                communications.
What Data Do We Collect?
For Contacts.
Contact Personal Data:
Users transmit names, and email addresses into our system from
              their Data Contact Lists.
Contact Tracking Information: Through our Service we can monitor
              Contact behavior regarding our emails such as who opened them,
              forwarded them, what links they click on and attachments they
              download. ¬†We also assist User in calendaring events with
              Contacts who have chosen to consent to such meetings.
------
The function of tracking an email is performed by embedding a
              tracking pixel in the sent email and detecting when a network
              request has been made to load that pixel.
Click throughs can be tracked by proxying sent links through
              Polymail‚Äôs servers, such that our Service is able to detect
              when a sent link has been clicked.
Polymail Users may also choose to track when files attachments
              included in their sent emails have been downloaded. This is
              performed by uploading file attachments to Polymail‚Äôs
              servers and embedding a link to download that file in the
              User‚Äôs email. This allows our service to detect when a
              request has been made to download a sent file
---------
For Users
.
User Personal Data. We collect Personal Data from users of our
              Services such as: names, e-mail addresses, age, location, whether
              user is outside the United States, and IP address. We collect
              payment information and discounts/coupon information to pay for
              the Services. We also collect the content you provide for your
              communications such as graphics, text and links that you write,
              upload, store and send.
Your Contact Data Lists:
User Tracking Information: ¬†We also collect information that
              on its own is not Personal Data, but when combined with your
              Personal Data, could become Personal Data.
---------
Device Information
. We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware
                model, operating system version, unique device identifiers and
                mobile network information including phone number).
Log information.
When you use our Application, we automatically collect and
                store certain information in server logs. This includes:
details of how you used our Application, such as your search
                queries.
Internet protocol address.
device event information such as crashes, system activity,
                hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and
                time of your request and referral URL.
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your
                account.
Location information.

                Application, we may collect and process information about your
                actual location, IP address or other similar items.¬† We use
                various technologies to determine location, including IP
                address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide
                us with information on nearby devices.
Information regarding contacts
.¬† We or our third-party partners will obtain and store
                information about your contacts and other people that you e-mail
                or that e-mail you.¬† We will use this information to
                enhance the Service.
Calendars
.¬† For calendar features, we will receive and store a list
                of your calendars and calendar events for each of those
                calendars.
Sent Mail
.¬† One of our features is e-mail tracking, which allows
                you to see the status of sent e-mails without any notification
                to (or need for click-through by) the recipient.¬† We need
                to collect and track information about your sent e-mail and your
                recipient's actions with respect to such e-mail in order for
                you to use this feature. Also, if you choose to make use of our
                recipient tracking, link-tracking, or attachment-tracking
                service, we will store the subject for the messages and we will
                host the attachment on our servers.
Shared Message Templates
.¬† One of our features allows users on a Polymail Pro team
                to share their Message Templates with the other members of their
                team. Once shared, any member of such user's team may use or
                edit those Message Templates. Further, if a user leaves a
                Polymail Pro team (or ceases to use our Service for any reason),
                any Message Templates that have been shared will remain with
                that Polymail Pro team.
Local storage; cache.
We may collect and store information (including Personal Data)
                locally on your device. We also cache message content for up to
                14 days since last access. Attachments are proxied through our
                servers for download and display, but not cached. Remote image
                content is proxied through our servers for enhanced privacy and
                security, and may be cached according to the origin's cache
                policy headers.
Indexing.
We may index your messages to provide better service to you.
                This index includes the date a message was received, folder, to,
                cc, bcc, from, subject, reply to, message ID headers, whether
                the message has attachments, attachment headers (including
                filename, size, content ID, content disposition, encoding and
                file type) and a blurb or snippet of the actual message.

Beacons (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags, or clear
              GIF‚Äôs.
When a User visits the Site‚Äôs homepage, we utilize an
              electronic file, called a web beacon, to count users that have
              visited the Site. Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique
              identifier that may be included on our Site Services for several
              purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to
              track and measure the performance of the Services, to monitor how
              many visitors view our Site. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on
              the user's device, Web Beacons are typically embedded
              invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail). Our use of web beacons
              is internal.
Cookies
We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store
              information when you use our Application, and this may include
              sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your
              device. When you visit our Site we use cookies, or similar
              technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log
              data. ¬†We use both session-based and persistent cookies.
              ¬†Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open
              and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.
              ¬†Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete
              them or until they expire. ¬†They are unique and allow us to
              do site analytics and customization, among other similar things.
              ¬†If you access our Site through your browser, you can manage
              your cookie settings.
We use information collected from cookies and other technologies
              to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our
              Service and for any other lawful purpose that we choose.
For more information, please check out our
Cookie Policy

:
Law Enforcement and Internal Operations
Personal Data may be provided where we are required to do so by
              law, or if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably
              necessary (i) to respond to claims asserted against
Polymail or to comply with the legal process (for example,
              discovery requests, subpoenas or warrants); (ii) to enforce or
              administer our policies and agreements with users; (iii) for fraud
              prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support,

Polymail, its users or members of the general public. ¬†We
              will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law
              enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise
              prohibited by law. ¬†However, nothing in this Privacy Policy
              is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may
              have to any third-party request to compel disclosure of your

              acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
              bankruptcy. ¬†Under such circumstances,
Polymail will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify its
              users if their Personal Data is to be disclosed or transferred
              and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

              perform functions or services on our behalf, such as software
              maintenance, data hosting, sending email messages, etc. ¬†We

              third-parties as may be required to perform their functions.

              your privacy as seriously as we do, including entering into Data

How is My Data Protected?
We take the security of your Personal Data very seriously and
              have implemented policies and procedures, including technical
              measures, that are designed to help safeguard it. While we strive
              to use best practices to protect your Personal Data, the Internet
              and computer technology are not 100% secure and we cannot
              absolutely ensure the security of any Personal Data that you
              provide to us.
In line with this philosophy, we try to get as little information
              from you as possible.¬†While we know your e-mail addresses and
              accounts, we do not know or collect the passwords for those
              accounts and you should continue to keep those passwords separate
              from your Polymail password. We use OAuth (wherever possible)
              which gives us access to your data without letting us know your
              password.
--------
Other than in rare instances and as described in the Privacy
              Policy, we do not store your e-mail or your Contact email
              addresses on our servers (they remain on the e-mail accounts that
              you link to your Polymail account). We have copies of your drafts
              on our servers, but they are immediately deleted once you
              successfully send the e-mail or delete the draft.¬†¬†If
              you would like more information about how we access and interact
              with your e-mail accounts, please contact us at the e-mail listed
              below.
We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and
              physical security measures to protect your Personal Data against
              unauthorized access, destruction or alteration. For example:
Data encryption through SSL.
Authentication for all data access.
Password manager for third-party vendor accounts.
Notification of designated officials at third parties (for
                example, a third party Security Administrator) when subject
                agreements are modified or terminated.
Non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations, restricting or
                controlling access to and use of sensitive data are
                contractually established with third party vendors.
Password protection on your account.
Data is kept on secure, encrypted servers, located in the
                US.
We do not use public communication channels.
Restricting staff access to Personal Data to authorized
                personnel, generally members of our sales team, support, and
                engineering with two factor authentications.
Access authorizations revoked in a timely manner with employees
                that change job functions or leave Polymail.
Tokenized payment processes so that we do not store your credit
                card information.
Regular staff privacy and security training
We use authentication for all data access, including a password
              manager that generates and stores unique passwords for every
              third-party vendor. We do not use any public communication
              channels.
Access to Data is limited to authorized personnel only. Sensitive
              Data information is restricted. Access to sensitive data is
              accountable to specific individuals, so that we may maintain
              better control over access and accountability for misuse.
              Additionally, as regards billing and payment Data, no credit card
              or payment information is handled in the sales process. Only
              individuals who are required to handle Stripe data have Stripe
              access. Access to sensitive data is promptly revokes from any
              employee who changes job functions or leaves Polymail. Where third
              parties are given access to data (see ‚ÄúTracking Data‚Äù
              section), responsible officials (such as, for example, the third
              party‚Äôs Security Administrator) are notified when the
              agreement is modified or terminated.
However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we
              cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we
              store, process or transmit.
For more information, see our
security whitepaper here.
Payments Encryption:
Polymail utilizes only PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment
              processors to ensure the security of your Personal Data via
              Stripe

              copies of data requested.
Right to Remove or Withdraw Consent
You have the right to withdraw consent where such consent is
              required to share or use data and you may request that we delete
              your Personal Data. ¬†If you receive communications from us
              and no longer wish to receive them, please follow the removal
              instructions in the email or change your account settings.
              ¬†You can delete your Personal Data by logging into your
              account and deleting your account. ¬†However, since your
              Personal Data is required for us to provide the Services to you,
              deleting it will also terminate your access to the services.
              ¬†Deleting your Personal Data does not mean that all of it
              will be removed. ¬†We take steps to delete Personal Data that
              is no longer necessary in relation to provide the Services by
              deleting it within 90 days of you terminating your account or if
              the account remains unused for more than one (1) year. ¬†We
              may be required by law, to retain it to exercise or defend legal
              claims, or contractual obligations with our customers to retain
              some information in connection with our obligation to provide the
              Services. ¬†We may de-identify and anonymize some data for
              purposes of retaining it.
Data Portability

              company providing similar services, we will work with them to do

              requestor and the company receiving the Personal Data.

              forty-five (45) days of receiving a complaint. For complaints that
              cannot be resolved between us and the complainant, we have agreed
              to participate in the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to
              the Privacy Shield Principles, which includes dispute resolution
              through means such as FTC enforcement, alternative dispute

We try to minimize disclosures of personal data as reasonably
              practical because we are mindful of our responsibility and
              potential liability in cases of onward transfers to third
              parties.
Please be advised that individuals may have the option to seek
              binding arbitration to resolve disputes regarding our privacy and
              data protection practices.
An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must
              take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim:
              (1) raise the claimed violation directly with the organization and
              afford the organization an opportunity to resolve the issue within
              the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles
              (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the
              Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise
              the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the
              Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an
              opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the
              timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade
              Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the
              individual.
We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the
              Federal Trade Commission (‚ÄúFTC‚Äù).¬† Should an
              individual be unable to resolve a complaint with us, they may
              contact the FTC at the following address:

              complaints with the Data Protection Authorities located in the
              jurisdiction they are located in.
Processing Contact data for Customers
Our Services may involve the processing of Personal Data on
              behalf of our customers. ¬†When we do so, we are acting as
              processors for the controllers of such data. ¬†As such, we
              take steps to ensure that Personal Data that is subject to GDPR is
              processed in accordance with controller instructions and GDPR;
              such as entering into a Data Processing Addendum incorporating EU
              Standard Contractual Clauses governing the processing,
              transmission and use of such End User Personal Data. ¬†If you
              wish to exercise your data subject rights to review, rectify,
              delete or port your End User Personal Data, please contact the
              controller to make such request. ¬†If you make the request to
              us, we will work with the controller to process and evaluate such
              request to confirm whether deletion is required by GDPR.
Transnational Transfer of Data
If you are providing your Personal Data to us directly to use our
              Services, we will transmit your data, including your Personal
              Data, to the United States in order to fulfill our contractual
              obligations to you.
US-EU and US-Swiss Privacy Shield Certification
The United States Department of Commerce has worked with the
              European Commission to develop the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy
              Shield Framework (‚ÄúPrivacy Shield‚Äù) to allow U.S.
              companies to meet the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) law
              requirements that Personal Data transferred from the EU to the
              United States be adequately protected. Polymail complies with the

              information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to
              the United States. Consistent with its pledge to protect personal
              privacy Polymail has certified to the Department of Commerce that
              it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any
              conflict between the terms in this privacy policy
              (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) and the Privacy Shield Principles, the
              Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the

              verbal).
Definitions
The following definitions shall apply throughout this
              Policy:

              third party that uses Personal Data provided to us to perform
              tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of us.
¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†"Personal Data‚Äù
              means Information or a set of information that identifies or could
              reasonably be ascribed to or be used by or on behalf of us to
              identify an individual or household. Personal Data does not
              include information that is encoded, anonymous, aggregated or
              publicly available information that has not been combined with

              union membership or information that specifies the health or sex
              life of the individual. In addition, we will treat any information
              as Sensitive Personal Data which received from a third party where
              that third party treats and identifies the information as
              sensitive.
Privacy Principles

              Shield Principles and the EU General Data Protection
              Directive¬†95/46/EC, on the protection of individuals with
              regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
              of such data.
1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Notice
When we collect Personal Data directly from individuals in the EU
              and/or other applicable countries, we will inform them about the
              purposes for which we collect and use their Personal Data, the

              disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, that
              we offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their
              Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous
              language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data
              to us, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event
              before we use the information for a purpose other than that for
              which it was originally collected. If we receive Personal Data
              from our affiliates or other entities in the EU and other
              countries with which we do business, we will use such information
              in accordance with the notices such entities provided and the
              choices made by the individuals to whom such Personal Data
              relates.

              whether their Personal Data is (a) to be disclosed to a third
              party (other than an Agent), or (b) to be used for a purpose other
              than the purpose for which it was originally collected or
              subsequently authorized by the individual.
For Sensitive Personal Data, we will give individuals the
              opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to
              (a) the disclosure of the information to a third party, or (b) the
              use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for
              which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by
              the individual. We will provide individuals with reasonable
              methods to exercise their choices. We may disclose Personal Data
              to third parties in the following instances:
Website Consultants and Service Providers
. We may disclose Personal Data to third party consultants and
              service providers (such as providers of hosting services, support,
              maintenance and remedial and repair services) to the extent that
              they require access to our databases, or the information contained
              in our databases, to service us and our customers under the
              conditions set out in the Privacy Shield Principles.
Enforcement of Rights / Security.
We reserve the right to release Personal Data (i) when we
              are under legal compulsion to do so (e.g. we have received a
              subpoena) or we otherwise believe that the law requires us to do
              so, (ii) when we believe it is necessary to protect and/or enforce
              the rights, property interests, or safety of us, our customers or
              others, or (iii) as we deem necessary to resolve disputes,
              troubleshoot problems, prevent fraud and/or enforce the Privacy
              Shield Principles.
Reorganization or Sale.
In the event that our company is merged with or becomes
              part of another organization, or in the event that our company is
              sold or it sells all or substantially all of its assets or is
              otherwise reorganized, the information you provide may be one of
              the transferred assets to the acquiring or reorganized
              entity.
As Otherwise Allowed by Law.
We may transfer Personal Data to third parties where we are
              expressly authorized by applicable law and the Privacy Shield
              Principles to do so.¬† We also may be required to disclose an
              individual's Personal Data in response to a lawful request by
              public authorities, including meeting national security or law
              enforcement requirements.
3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accountability For Onward
              Transfers
We will obtain assurances from our Agents that they will
              safeguard Personal Data consistently with this policy. If we have
              knowledge that an Agent is using or disclosing Personal Data in a
              manner contrary to this policy, we will take reasonable steps to
              prevent or stop the use or disclosure.
We try to minimize disclosures of personal data as reasonably
              practical because we are mindful of our responsibility and
              potential liability in cases of onward transfers to third
              parties.
4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Security
We will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data in
              our possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
              disclosure, alteration and destruction.
5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Data Integrity & Purpose
              Limitation
We will use Personal Data only in ways that are compatible with
              the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized
              by the individual. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that
              Personal Data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete,
              and current.
6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Access
Upon request, we will grant individuals reasonable access to
              Personal Data that we hold about them, and we will take reasonable
              steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete
              information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or
              incomplete.
7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Resource, Enforcement And
              Liability
We will conduct compliance audits of our relevant privacy
              practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that we
              determine is in violation of this Policy will be subject to
              disciplinary action up to and including termination of
              employment.

EU-US and EU-Swiss Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution and
              Enforcement
Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of
              Personal Data should be directed to us at the address given below.
              We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes
              regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with
              the principles contained in this Policy within forty-five (45)
