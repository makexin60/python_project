The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
3.2.1. Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (‘opt-out’), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
3.2.2. Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
3.2.3. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
