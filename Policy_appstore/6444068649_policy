Preamble
I prefer to avoid collecting data from you. I do not sell, rent or share personal information on you throughout your use of my apps or websites with third parties. In this policy I explain: what data I collect and why, how your data is handled, and your rights concerning your data.

The person in charge for the processing of personal data within the meaning of
GDPR article 4
is:

Apps
None of my apps are tracking you. With your consent, I am using
TelemetryDeck
for
GDPR
and
CCPA
compliant, fully anonymized data collection, which you can opt-out from at any time within the respective app itself. My intention behind this is to get a better understanding on how my products are used, to make informed decisions for further development, which in return will benefit you as a customer.
If an internet connection in one of my products is established, its use is described in the apps’
Internet Access Policy
.
My apps enforce HTTPS encryption.
Legal basis for processing your data for this purpose is
GDPR article 6, section 1 (a)
.
TestFlights
Some of my apps are available for beta-testing through Apple’s
TestFlight
service. If you joined a TestFlight, Apple Inc. will collect and send crash logs, your personal information such as name and email address, usage information, and any feedback you submit to me through TestFlight. A list of the data that is collected and stored can be found
here
. I only use this information to improve my apps. I do not share any of it with a third party. Apple may use this information to improve their TestFlight app and detect and prevent fraud. Apple retains TestFlight data for one year. To view and manage your data with Apple, including your data that is sent to Apple through TestFlight, visit
Data and Privacy
. If you would like to be removed from one of my TestFlights, please contact privacy0225​
@
​appahead​.​studio, or leave the TestFlight yourself from within the TestFlight-App.
Legal basis for processing your data for this purpose is
GDPR article 6, section 1 (a)
.
Websites
My websites do not set cookies. I am interested in only a handful of anonymized data points around my audience to learn if it’s worth putting effort into my digital offerings. Those are, for example: visitor count, most frequently visited pages, popular visitor countries or referring websites that send my visitors to my websites.
To get these insights I am using
TelemetryDeck
. A list of the data that is collected and stored can be found
here
.
My websites are hosted with
IONOS
. IONOS stores visitor information in server logfiles, like described
here
. Those logs include, among other things, the anonymized IP address, the browser visitors use, the time and date of the visits, and the system that visitors use. IONOS deletes logfiles after 8 weeks at the latest.
My websites enforce HTTPS encryption.
My websites may contain links to websites of other providers not affiliated with me. I have no influence on what data is collected and used by these third parties. As the collection and processing of data by third parties is naturally beyond my control, I cannot accept any responsibility for this.
Support Interactions by Email
When handling support requests from you via email, I collect the emails you sent to me. Those usually include your email address, metadata which may be contained in the email header and any information you provide voluntarily. This information is collected solely to help resolve your support inquiry. 
I delete correspondence on resolved topics from my archive once a year, in order to have context from previous interactions which may help me to answer your future questions more quickly and accurately, or to identify broad trends in support requests, which may help me identify and solve problems with my products, unless (1) you and I have an ongoing business relationship or friendship, (2) unless you have expressly consented to further use your data and (3) unless the correspondence falls under commercial or tax retention obligations.
Like my websites, my emails are hosted with
IONOS
as well.
If you would like to remove support emails you have sent, please contact privacy0225​
@
​appahead​.​studio.
Legal basis for processing your data for this purpose is
GDPR article 6, section 1 (a), (b) and (f)
.
Newsletter
I never send unsolicited emails. In order to receive
my newsletter
, you have to actively subscribe to it. It’s low volume—only a few messages per year is typical—and is generally limited to announcements of important product updates or significant new product releases.
My newsletter is hosted by a GDPR-compliant service called
Buttondown
. Buttondown does not collect any information about you other than what you explicitly provide to it and retains it until you ask to be removed. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are contained in all messages sent. You can also contact me directly at privacy0225​
@
​appahead​.​studio to unsubscribe. Neither me or Buttondown will sell your data to any third parties.
Legal basis for processing your data for this purpose is
GDPR article 6, section 1 (a)
.
Social Media
I provide direct support exclusively via email. Please don’t reach out to me for support requests through social media. Although you will find me on most common social media platforms, please be aware that I don’t make the rules there. Please don’t ever share personal or sensitive information with me through social media or third-party platforms.
Data Protection
I use technical and organizational security measures to ensure that data is protected against loss, incorrect changes or unauthorized access by third parties. To the extent necessary for the above-mentioned purposes, only authorized persons have access to your data.
Your Rights
You have the right to (1) request all personal information I hold about you, (2) ask me to update or correct those informations, (3) ask me to delete it, (4) revoke the processing of your data and (5) to make a complaint with a regulatory authority.
I’m happy to help. Please contact me and we’ll sort it out.
Future Changes
This privacy policy may change at any time.
