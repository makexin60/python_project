Who do we share your data with?
Third Party Service Providers
We employ third-party service providers to help us develop, maintain, host, backup, and perform other services required to operate the Service. Some of these third parties may have access to or process a minimal set of personal data necessary to perform their function. Our contracts with service providers require them to preserve the confidentiality of personal data shared with them.

Any such disclosure to such third parties is bound by the privacy protections set forth herein.
Disclosure for Law Enforcement
Curelator will disclose User personal data outside the scope of these provisions only as required to do so by law or compelled by court, government or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction. Personal data from Users may be subject to Federal and local laws that require Curelator to disclose this data in certain circumstances.
Change of Ownership
Curelator reserves the right to transfer our user databases, together with any personal data contained in them, to any third party acquiring our assets after notice and the opportunity for a User to request that personal data not be transferred.

The following applies solely to California “consumers” as defined in Section 17014 of Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations. We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). This policy describes our collection, use, disclosure, and “sale” of “personal information” of California consumers as these terms are defined under the CCPA.
Job applicants, current and former employees, and individuals subject to business-to-business communications are not considered “consumers” for the purpose of this policy.
Information We Collect
We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (“personal information”). In particular, we have collected the following categories of personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months:
Identifiers, such as name, mailing address, email address, etc.

Professional or employment-related information, such as employment status.
Inferences drawn from other personal information, such as information uploaded to N1‑Headache application, which may reflect a person’s preferences, predispositions, behavior, and attitudes.
We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the following types of sources:
Directly from you. For example, from the onboarding questionnaire forms and/or through the N1‑Headache application related to the services for which you engage us.
Indirectly from you. For example, website usage details collected.
From third parties that interact with us in connection with the services we perform. For example, from your healthcare provider.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.
Disclosure of Personal Information
We do not share your personal information with “third parties” as defined under the CCPA for a business purpose. We may use or disclose your personal information to our “service providers” as defined by the CCPA that we collect for one or more of the following purposes:
To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if you provide us with personal information in order for us to provide you with the N-1 Headache service, we will use that information to provide you with this service.
To provide you with information or services that you request from us.
To create, maintain, customize, improve, and secure your account with us.
To provide you with support and respond to your inquiries, including investigating and addressing your concerns and monitoring and improving our responses.

To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us is among the assets transferred.
Sale of Personal Information
Curelator does not sell the personal information of California consumers, including personal information of California consumers under the age of 16.
Your Privacy Rights
The CCPA provides California consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights with Curelator.
The Right to Know: You have the right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed or sold about you in the previous twelve (12) months. You may also request a copy of the personal information we have collected on you over the past twelve (12) months. See the “Exercising Your California Privacy Rights” section for instructions on submitting a right-to-know request.
The Right to Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete and direct our service providers to delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. See the “Exercising Your California Privacy Rights” section for instructions on submitting a right to deletion request.

Use of an Authorized Agent
You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make these privacy requests on your behalf to exercise these rights. An authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney in accordance with California law. If this has not occurred, we will require the agent to provide proof that you have authorized it to act on your behalf and may require you to verify your own identity with us directly before we accept a request. We will do this by requiring the authorized agent to present verifiable written authorization from you that you have provided the agent with permission to submit the request and independently verify the agent’s own identity with Curelator.

Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;

Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18 without consent from a parent or guardian. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to remove that personal data from our servers in a timely manner.
Our service is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain personal data about anyone under the age of 13.

We may modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any modification or amendment to this Privacy Policy will be applied to personal data immediately. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we are processing and protecting personal data.
