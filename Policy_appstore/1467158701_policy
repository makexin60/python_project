GREAT RESPONSE FROM THE TEAM! AFTER TWO ROUNDS THEY GOT HOOKED ON AND DID NOT WANT TO STOP PLAYING
– CORINNA, TEAM COACH
WHAT’S AT PLAY?
Escape the BOOM! is a cooperative game. One player must defuse the bomb but has no idea how. The rest of the team has the manual with the necessary instructions but cannot see the bomb. The only way to succeed? Communication! And lots of it. You have only five minutes to decipher the clues together. Withstand the pressure, keep your cool… and Escape the BOOM!
WHO IS IT FOR?
Whether you’re fans of live escape games, challenging puzzles, or have a history of defusing bombs, Escape the BOOM! will keep you on the edge of your seat. You can play Escape the BOOM! together around a table, but it’s also perfect for remote gaming via Zoom, Teams, or Discord.
We’ve even heard of people having fun solving the riddles on their own. 😉

Escape the BOOM! is also used for team building activities and retrospectives, helping teams grow while having fun. Learn more about team activities on the Workshops page.
