Google Firebase
Our Apps use technology from Google Firebase (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, “Google”). Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers numerous services for developers. You can find a list of them here:
https://firebase.google.com/terms/
. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, personal data is limited to “instance IDs” that are given a time stamp. “Instance IDs” issued by Firebase are unique and therefore allow different events or processes to be linked. This data is neither data that we can identify personally, nor do we endeavour to personalise it subsequently. We process this consolidated data to analyse and optimise user behaviour, such as evaluation of crash reports. For the current Firebase Privacy Regulations, please see
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
.
In addition to the “instance ID” described above, Google also uses the advertising ID of the terminal device for Firebase Analytics. You can restrict use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device.

For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking
AppsFlyer
The HypnoBox App uses the “AppsFlyer” app usage and analysis tool, a product provided by AppsFlyer Ltd. When a customer installs the HypnoBox App, AppsFlyer saves installation and event data from the customer’s iOS or Android app.
We have a legitimate interest in information about the success of marketing efforts. Using the AppsFlyer service, we measure the success of our campaigns. AppsFlyer provides us with the information in an aggregated form. In order to trace the use of a mobile app, we forward information about downloads and installations as well as “in-app events”, such as in-app purchases, to AppsFlyer. AppsFlyer obtains information from the data that is transmitted by the SDKs (Software Development Kit) in a mobile end user application to the servers. The data collected by the SDK contains information, such as IP addresses (anonymized), browser, platform, SDK version, anonymized user ID, time stamp, developer key, usage version, device identifiers (such as Identifier for Advertisers), Google advertising ID, device model, device manufacturer, operating system version, in-app events, and network status. The end user data collected by the AppsFlyer platform is merely representative for us to analyze our applications.
You can object to the collection and storing of data by AppsFlyer at any time with effect for the future by deactivating general tracking in the app settings of the HypnoBox App.
