iDoc24 Inc (“iDoc24″) is committed to protecting your personal information and privacy. iDoc24 Inc own the following brands as websites and apps that are U.S. subsidiaries of iDoc24 Inc.
Other Covered Entities:
iDoc24, First Derm, STD Triage and AUTODERM.
This Privacy & Security Policy applies to the service provided via the websites and mobile applications known as
iDoc24
(iDoc24.com),
First Derm
(FirstDerm.com) and
STD Triage
(STDtriage.com) (collectively the “Service”). AUTODERM is an API to our artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. This policy describes the personal information we collect from you and how we use and secure it. “Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII” means information that can be used to identify you personally, such as an email address, a photograph with unique identifying features, etc.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy & Security Policy will have the meanings set forth in the
Terms of Service
.
Information We Collect
If you choose to provide us with your PII by using the Service, you are agreeing to the processing and storage of your information in the United States and countries outside of the United States which may have data protection laws that differ from laws in your country.
Information collected by iDoc24 consists of the following, and constitutes a “Case” and applies to the service provided via the websites and mobile applications known as
iDoc24
(iDoc24.com),
First Derm
(FirstDerm.com),
STD Triage
(STDtriage.com) and the AUTODERM API.
Two (one or two with AUTODERM) images of the user’s skin condition. These images are generally non-identifiable but may be identifiable if the user submits images of the face, rare birthmark, or identifying tattoo. We encourage users to submit images that are regarded as having no identifying features.
The following sections b), c) and d) applies to the service provided via the websites and mobile applications known as
iDoc24
(iDoc24.com),
First Derm
(FirstDerm.com),
STD Triage
(STDtriage.com)
ONLY.
Descriptive text on the symptoms, duration, history, age, gender, etc of the skin problem.
We give the user the option to submit an email address via the webform (not iOS or Android) so they may be notified when their Case is answered. This is optional and is not required by the user. Email addresses are deleted from our servers immediately after the Customer has been notified their Case has been answered. We do not store, sell, or catalogue email addresses past this time.
On iOS, an Apple Push Notification Token, which is generated by the user’s device, is stored to allow for a Push Notification when the Customer’s Case has been answered and remind of any outstanding cases to be answered.
To help facilitate the question and response process, and the payment of Professionals (i.e Doctors), iDoc24 may require basic data from Customers such as email address to be submitted to third party payment processors, such as PayPal.
Professional applicants (i.e. Doctors) may be asked for additional information, such as full names, addresses, telephone numbers, professional license and certification information, and payment-related information. Other PII may be requested in certain circumstances.
Customer payment and contact information via third parties (PayPal and Google Wallet) is stored separately from Customer Cases. iDoc24 provides Customers with alphanumeric codes once payment is confirmed, and the codes may be used to view Professionals’ reports. The reports do not contain Customer email addresses or other PII, except to the extent that the images or reports themselves depict or describe a condition sufficiently rare/unique that they are PII.
iDoc24 is intended for use by persons over 13 years old. In addition, it does not knowingly solicit or collect PII from persons under 13 years old. We may delete from the Service PII, as well as Posts and other information, from users we believe are under the age of 13.
To enhance and individualize your experience with the Service, we may use small files called “cookies” on our websites that let us know that you are a prior user and help us ensure that your information is directed to you. We also use services on the web and in our mobile applications that help us improve your customer experience. (For example, if a report is waiting for you and you have not accessed it, we may remind you to do so.) We do not use these services to collect information about you for any other purpose.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We also collect non-personally identifiable information about visitors’ web activity. This information includes the operating system a visitor is using, the date and time the user visited a website or mobile app, referring URLs (what website the visitor came from), Internet service provider, browser type, device identifier, and information on the pages that visitors access or visit. Most non-personally identifiable information is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies.
Use of Your Information
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
iDoc24 may use, share, transfer, or disclose your PII and/or usage statistics, itself or in conjunction with third parties, for payment processing, fraud prevention, customer service, research, and to tailor iDoc24’s content and services to its users’ needs. These third parties are authorized to use your PII only as necessary for the purpose(s) of iDoc24’s agreements with them.
iDoc24 may share your PII with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which event it will require that such companies follow this Policy with respect to your PII.
Correspondence Sent to You
iDoc24 will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, except:
Users may receive iDoc24 registration emails when their Cases have been responded to, Professional applicants may receive iDoc24 communications relating to their applications, Professionals may receive notifications of images submitted by Customers, and all users may receive updates and notices about Case, their accounts, payments and new features and policies;
Deleting PII
If at any time you would like your PII to be removed from the Service and/or database, or believe that iDoc24 has not adhered to these privacy principles, please notify us by email at info@iDoc24.com with your 8 digit case number. Via AUTODERM API, we do not deliver any case numbers. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your PII and/or promptly detect and remedy any problems.
Links to Third-Party Sites
To the extent that links to other Web sites are contained in Posts on the Service, please note that they are not operated or controlled by iDoc24 and iDoc24 is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
Our Site may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the ShareThis button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Security and Data Retention
iDoc24 uses multiple security procedures and practices to protect from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure users’ PII.
All PII is password protected. All passwords use encryption.
iDoc24 uses third party services to process payments (Apple iTunes, Google Wallet and PayPal). iDoc24 obtains and stores only so much payment information as is necessary to generate the code associating the payment with the image, and only for so long as is necessary to ensure delivery of the report. (For example: last four digits of credit card; email address if one is collected and forwarded by the payment processor.) No payment information is stored on the same servers as user images, comments and reports. iDoc24 does not send images, comments or reports to email addresses collected by payment processors.
Our main servers are hosted by a third party provider in a private and secure environment.
Despite these security procedures and practices, as is the case with all computer networks connected to the Internet, iDoc24 cannot guarantee the security of your PII or any other information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
We retain your account information and the information provided by you in the form of Cases for so long as we determine is necessary, at which time we may delete and/or aggregate and store it in aggregate form indefinitely.
If you wish to have your Case removed from our site you may contact us at info@iDoc24.com. You need to provide your 8 digit case number or provide proof and time of payment so we can ensure you are the rightful owner of the Case in question.
Updates to This Policy
By using the Service, you are accepting this policy. We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. Please check the date of this policy each time you visit to ensure that you are aware of the most current version. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, please do not use this site.
If we make any material changes to how your PII is used or shared, we will notify our users by posting an announcement on our company blog by way of a notice on the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy
iDoc24 is particularly concerned with safeguarding the privacy of children. The Service is not directed to children under 13, and children under 13 are prohibited from using the Site and Service. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with PII without the parent’s or guardian’s consent, he or she should contact us. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, we will delete such information from our systems. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. A parent or guardian may submit a Case of a child under 13 and may communicate with us in order to provide and obtain information concerning the child’s Case.

Types of personal data we collect and use
Our
online privacy policy
describes the categories of personal data we may receive in the United States, as well as the purposes for which we use that personal data. We will only process personal data in ways that are compatible with the purpose we collected it for, or for the purposes you later authorize. Before we use your personal data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out. We maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that personal data we collect and use is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
