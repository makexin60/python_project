In addition to this personal information, from time to time we may collect additional information about you through your interactions with us or in other circumstances.
Social Media
If you log into your account with us through a social media site, we will also have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and profile photo, in accordance with the site’s account verification procedures. If you subsequently want to unlink your social media account, please contact customer service or use available tools on the site.
If you interact with content on our social media profiles (for example, if you “like” or share a post from Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts), those social media sites may share information about you with us, including your public profile, e-mail address and friend list. If you choose to “like” or share content, information about you may be publicly displayed on the social network, depending on your privacy settings. If you post information on a social media or another third-party service that references us or our products and services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), we may publish your post on our social media accounts or websites. For more information about the privacy practices of any social media sites that you may use to log in to your account or to interact with us, you should review the privacy Notice of that social media site and check your privacy settings through that site.
Information You Provide About Others
The content you choose to upload to our service, including your photos and the information you store in your address book, may include personal information of others.  If you choose to share your photographs or other information with someone else through a feature we offer, we will use the personal information you provide (for example, the e-mail address of the recipient) to fulfill your request and for other purposes described in this Privacy Notice. Before you upload and/or share personal information of others through our service, please ensure that you have the consent of such persons to do so.
Other Information Contained in Your Photos
When you upload your photos to our platforms or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the place your photo was taken, tags and similar information stored by your image capture device. For more information, see the section titled Your Photos, below.
Cookies
We and our service providers collect information about how you use our services – for example what web or mobile pages you have viewed – to administer our services, analyze trends, generate analytics, provide a better user experience, improve our products and services, detect and prevent fraud or security incidents and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. With your consent, our Sites, App and emails use pixels, tags, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Cookies”) that are created when you use our online services and are stored on your computer or mobile device. (See Cookie Options, below.)
Cookies help us offer convenient features like storing the contents of your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, remembering your login and account settings, recognizing your browser when you visit, customizing your current and future visits, and providing you with information about products that interest you. Cookies help us personalize your experience and save time during checkout. We also use the information we collect to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our site to monitor site traffic, develop marketing programs, and improve our website design and content.
We use the information collected by our third-party service providers using Cookies to analyze and track data, improve our services, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand our users’ online activity. Our service providers may also show you advertisements for our products and services on other websites and may combine this information with other information those service providers have gathered about your visits to those other websites so that the advertisements you receive are more likely to be of interest to you.
Other Sources
We may also obtain data that is publicly available or from third party sources, such as address verification services or third-party marketing database partners, to improve the accuracy of and add to what we know about our customers and prospective customers. We may combine this information with your personal information for the purposes described in this Notice. We also may collect information from other companies, organizations, or third-party partners. For example, we may receive information about you from a partner when we jointly offer services or when you elect to link your Snapfish account with another company’s account.
Employment
In addition to information collected from our customers, we and our service providers also collect certain information from candidates who apply for a job with Snapfish and our family of brands to contact you about your application and evaluate your qualifications for the position, including your name, phone number, e-mail address, postal address, education information, employment information, information you provide in connection with our application, information you make available on your social media accounts, information that is available publicly, and information you authorize us to collect via third parties, including former employers or references. If you would like to request or delete that information, please contact us at
privacy@snapfish.com
In certain circumstances, you may submit your application for employment through a third-party service that displays our job posting. We do not control the privacy practices of these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies carefully prior to submitting your application materials.
How long do we retain the personal information we collect about you?
Snapfish will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Notice, for as long as your account is active (i.e., for the lifetime of your user account), or as needed to provide the Sites, Apps and associated services (Services) to you. If you no longer want Snapfish to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account. Snapfish will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax laws), resolve disputes, perform and enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this Notice.
How do we share your information with third parties?
We do not “sell” personal information in the ordinary sense of that term. That is, we don’t provide your personally identifiable information to third parties in exchange for money. We may share personal information in the following situations.
Service Providers
We sometimes use third-party service providers to act on our behalf, for example to help us deliver our services, fulfill your product orders, process payments, enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, deliver our advertisements, and to provide professional, marketing, security, and information technology services. These service providers are only allowed to use your information in connection with the specific service they provide on our behalf.
Partners and Affiliates
Snapfish is part of the
Shutterfly family of companies and brands
. We may share your information among our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries for purposes described in this Notice. This allows us to offer features such as the ability to use your Snapfish account credentials across all of our Web properties and applications where available.
Your membership in other organizations and/or retail membership programs we partner with may entitle you to special offers on our Sites and Apps, in which case we share offer redemption information (which may include your information) with the partner as necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.
Law Enforcement, Mergers, and Other Situations
We may be required to share your personal information in other, limited circumstances. For example, we may be required to share certain information to respond to a subpoena or similar judicial process, to comply with state, federal, or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies. If necessary, we may also share information with law enforcement without a subpoena or similar judicial process if doing so may help protect the personal safety of a customer, a photo subject, or members of the public. We reserve the right to report to the appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any information that we believe may be evidence of criminal activity or violation of any applicable law.
Additionally, your information may be transferred to another organization if, for example, we negotiate for or transfer the ownership or operation of the Sites and Apps because we have merged with or have been acquired by another organization, if we liquidate our assets, if there is a change in ownership control, or a financing transaction. In those cases, the new company’s use of your information will still be subject to this Notice and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
Does our website collect information from children?
Our Sites and Apps are intended for use by general audiences and are not targeted directly at children under 18. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information through our websites or apps, we will remove their personally identifiable information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided such information through our websites or apps, the parent or guardian should contact us in writing at
privacy@snapfish.com
so that we may respond appropriately.
What options do you have to limit our collection and use of your personal information?
You have choices about how your information is collected and used. You can notify us of your preferences when you create an account with us, and if you would like to review or correct your personal information on our Sites and Apps, you can do so via your account settings. There may be times when we are unable to fulfill your request – for example, if providing access to your personal information would reveal confidential commercial or proprietary information or personal information about someone else (and we cannot separate your data), if we are prohibited by law from disclosing the information, or if we have a legal obligation to retain certain data. We may require additional personal information from you for the purposes of verifying your identity and rights.
Opting out of Marketing Communications
If you no longer want to receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages you receive, by changing your marketing preferences through your Account Settings. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the services we provide, such as service announcements and administrative messages (for example, communications related to a pending order, an unresolved customer service issue, or a Notice update). We do not offer you the ability to opt-out of receiving those communications.
Cookie Options
You have several options to manage cookies and trackers. If you don’t want our Sites and Apps to collect information using these technologies, you can change your web browser settings to reject Cookies from the site or to alert you before a cookie is placed on your computer. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change these preferences. Please note that cookie and tracker-based opt-outs only apply to the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out cookie is applied. If you clear cookies from your device or switch to a different browser, your opt-out will no longer be valid and you will need to opt out again where you want your choices to apply. If you accept a cookies or tracker, you can delete it at any time through your web browser. If you choose not to accept cookies or trackers used for analytics and site functionality, you will not be able to enjoy all the features available to our registered users.
You may also manage the cookies and trackers we use on our Sites and Apps by following the Cookie Notice link you will see in the footer of Snapfish webpages. If you make choices and return to our site from a different browser or machine, you may need to repeat these choices.
The Network Advertising Alliance (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) offer opt-out tools to help you manage your choices for participating companies that use Cookies for Interest-Based Advertising and cross-app advertising. For more information about these tools please visit:

How do we keep your information secure?
Although no website, application, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof,” we have safeguards in place to protect against unauthorized access and disclosures of the personal information we control, including technical, physical, and administrative safeguards and security measures. Despite these measures, however, we cannot guarantee that our information security safeguards will never be compromised.
How do we make updates to this Notice?
As we implement new technology and introduce new services or otherwise change our privacy practices, or in response to changes in applicable laws or regulations, we may modify this Notice and provide notice to you by posting updates on this page. Please check back periodically to view any updates. Changes to our Notice will become effective when posted.  If we change this Privacy Notice in a material way, we will endeavor to promptly notify our customers.  Your continued use of our websites, mobile applications and/or other services following such notice acknowledges your acceptance of such updated terms.

Your Photos
At Snapfish, Pictures are the Big Picture.
The photos and other content that you upload to your Snapfish account (“Your Content”) may include personal information about you or others, and this section of our Privacy Center addresses frequently asked questions about Your Content.
Do you share the photos that I upload to Snapfish?
At Snapfish, we value the trust you place in us when you store Your Content on our platform, and we can assure you that we treat Your Content as private information that belongs to you.  We share your photos only in the following circumstances:
If you ask us to.
Enabling you to share your photos electronically is one of the key benefits we offer at Snapfish. You are able to send an email invitation to your selected recipients, and then allow them to view, save, or purchase products from your pictures. This email invitation contains a link created specifically for your pictures.
Order fulfillment and providing our services.
In order to provide our service, the Snapfish employees and agents who work to fulfill your order and service your account may see your Content in the course of performing their jobs.  Similarly, if you order a product that includes Your Content, we may share Your Content with service providers who help us fulfill your order. These parties are only allowed to use your photos to perform services for Snapfish, though – they can’t use them for any other purpose.
Does Snapfish use my photos in advertisements?
No, Snapfish does not use your photos in our advertisements. Photos you upload to Snapfish may be incorporated into product recommendations that appear on your Snapfish homepage or in communications we send to you, but these photos aren’t used in public advertising, and only you will receive customized product recommendations made using your photos. You may opt out of receiving such communications from us and change your contact preferences within your account at any time.
Does Snapfish collect information from my photos and projects? If so, how do you use it?
What we collect.
When you upload your photos to our platform or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time, place and general location your photo was taken, and similar “metadata” captured by your image capture device. If you wish to restrict the capture of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.
How we use it.
We may analyze your photo content and metadata to help you tag and organize your photos to create products, to make personalized product suggestions and recommendations to you (such as showing you how your pictures may look in a collage or other Snapfish product), and to send you reminders and suggestions based on the information you include in your projects, such as birthdays and anniversaries.
How long does Snapfish keep my photos? What are my options?
If you have a Snapfish account, you control how long it remains active. Snapfish will retain your photos for as long as your account remains active. You also have the ability to download and/or delete some or all of the photos in your account at any time. If you delete Snapfish photos from your account, they will be removed from your Snapfish app and web interface, and we will permanently delete them from our system in the regular course of business.

Where we transfer data from the EU, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, Snapfish will implement appropriate safeguards to comply with applicable law in relation to the transfer including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other measures that comply with applicable law, for personal data that is being transferred to places where the EU, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom have determined that an adequate level of protection is not guaranteed.
