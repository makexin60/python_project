Service Data We Collect
We process Customer Data and Service Data in order to provide the Services. This Privacy Notice applies solely to Service Data and
does not
apply to Customer Data. “Customer Data” is defined as data provided by or on behalf of Customer or Customer End Users for processing via the Services, unless it is otherwise defined in the specific product’s Terms of Service, in which case, that definition applies. For additional information related to Customer Data processing, please refer to your relevant Customer agreement for information about processing Customer Data and to
Annex 1
for information about subprocessors.
Service Data is the personal information we collect or generate during the provision and administration of the Services, excluding any Customer Data. Service Data includes:
When you engage us to use our Services or sign-up to the Services, and to provide support as agreed.
We collect and process your contact information and billing information when you engage us to use our Services or sign-up to the Services and to provide support as agreed between the parties. If you are a representative of a business that wishes to use, or is already using, our Services, we will collect your contact information such as your name, title and company name, contact information, i.e., email address and phone number, and information relating to the potential or existing engagement and any support agreed between us and that business.
Payments and transactions.
We keep reasonable business records of charges, payments, and billing details and issues.
Settings and configurations.
We record your configuration and settings, including usernames, resource identifiers, and attributes. This includes service and security settings for data and other resources.
Technical and operational details of your usage of the Services.
We collect information about usage, operational status, software errors and crash reports, authentication details, quality and performance metrics, and other technical details necessary for us to operate and maintain the Services and related software. This information includes device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP addresses.
Your direct communications.
We keep records of your communications and interactions with us and our partners, for example, when you send us an inquiry, provide feedback, or sign up to get a demo or to receive news and updates from us.
When you visit the Website.
We collect analytics information about your interaction with the Website, such as device identifiers and identifiers from cookies or tokens.
Why We Process Service Data
We process Service Data for the following purposes:
Provide the Services you request.
Service Data is primarily used to deliver the Services that you and our customers request. This requires processing of Service Data for purposes such as billing for the services you use, ensuring those Services are delivered or working as intended, detecting and avoiding outages or other problems you might experience, and securing your data and Services.
Make recommendations to optimize use of the Services.
We use Service Data to provide you and our customers with recommendations. This includes suggesting ways to better secure your account or data, options to reduce service charges or improve performance, and information about new or related products and features. We also evaluate your response to our recommendations.
Maintain and improve the Services and Cloud Services.
We evaluate Service Data to help us improve the performance and functionality of the Services. As we optimize the Services for you, this will improve them for our customers and vice versa.
Provide and improve other services you request, including Cloud Services.
We use Service Data to deliver and improve other Services that you and our customers request, including Google or third-party services that are enabled via the Services, administrative consoles, marketplaces, or APIs.
Assist you, including support.
We use Service Data to provide the technical support that you and our customers request, and to assess whether we have met your needs. We also use Service Data to improve our online support, and to communicate with you and our customers. This includes sending notifications about updates to the Services, and responding to support requests.
Protect you, our users, the public, us, and Google.
We use Service Data to improve the safety and reliability of our services by detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm us, our users, our customers, the public or Google. These activities are an important part of our commitment to secure our services.
Comply with legal obligations.
We use Service Data to comply with our legal obligations and Google’s legal obligations, for example, where we are responding to a legal process or an enforceable governmental request, or to meet our financial record-keeping obligations.
To achieve these purposes, we use Service Data together with information we collect from other Google products and services you use. In particular, we combine Service Data with this other information because:
It helps us evaluate the use of the Services and other Google products to inform product development decisions.
It helps us detect fraud and abuse, such as fraudulent login attempts.
It enables us to comply with enforceable legal requests seeking data about a particular user's interactions across Google’s products.
It enables us to provide specific features of the Services (for example, to inform rankings for surfacing relevant contacts in Gmail).
We use algorithms to recognize patterns in Service Data. Manual collection and review of Service Data may also occur, such as when you interact directly with our billing or support teams. We also use Service Data for internal reporting and analysis of applicable product and business operations for which we aggregate and anonymize Service Data to eliminate personal information.
Where Service Data Is Stored
We maintain servers around the world and Service Data may be processed on servers located outside of the country where our users and customers are located from these
locations
, or as otherwise specified. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.
Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this privacy notice. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the frameworks described below.
Adequacy decisions
The European Commission has determined that certain countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) adequately protect personal data, which means that data can be transferred from the European Union (EU), Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland to that third country without any further safeguard being necessary. The UK and Switzerland have approved similar adequacy decisions. We rely on the following adequacy decisions in some cases:
1.
European Commission adequacy decisions
2.
UK adequacy regulations
3.
Swiss adequacy decisions
Data Privacy Frameworks
As described in the
certification
table, Google complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries (including EEA member countries), Switzerland and the UK respectively.
Regarding
Google Cloud Acquisitions
, certain entities have certified their respective adherence to these
DPF Principles.
The respective entities remain responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Onward Transfer principle (see DPF Principles for more details) with third parties for external processing on their behalf, as described in the
How We Share Service Data
section of this notice. To learn more about the DPF, please visit the
DPF website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our relevant DPF certifications, we encourage you to contact us. Google is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the DPF Principles
.
Standard contractual clauses
Standard contractual clauses (SCCs) are written commitments between parties that can be used as a ground for data transfers from the EU to third countries by providing appropriate data protection safeguards. SCCs have been approved by the European Commission and can’t be modified by the parties using them (you can see the SCCs adopted by the European Commission
here
,
here
, and
here
). Such clauses have also been approved for transfers of data to countries outside the UK and Switzerland. Where required, we rely on SCCs for data transfers. If you want to obtain a copy of the SCCs, you can contact us via
our contact email address
below.
How We Secure Service Data
Our Services are offered with strong security features to protect your data. We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
Encrypting Service Data at rest and while in transit between our facilities.
Regularly reviewing our Service Data collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems; and
Restricting access to Service Data to our employees, contractors, and agents, including Google employees, contractors, and agents, who need that Service Data in order to process it for us. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
How We Share Service Data
We do not share Service Data with companies, organizations, or individuals outside the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google except in the following cases:
When you procure third-party services
We share your information outside of the Google Cloud Acquisitions when you or our customer choose(s) to procure a third-party service through Google Cloud Platform, the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace, the Google Workspace Marketplace, or choose(s) a third-party application that requests access to your information.
With your consent
We’ll share your information outside of the Google Cloud Acquisitions where we have obtained your consent to do so.
With your administrators and authorized resellers
When you use the Services, your administrator and resellers authorized to manage your or your organization’s account will have access to certain Service Data. For example, they may be able to:
View account and billing information, activity and statistics
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Access your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We do not sell your Service Data to any third parties.
We share your Service Data with trusted third-party providers to process it for us as we instruct them, in compliance with this Privacy Notice and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. In particular, we share your Service Data with our third-party providers when you request technical support services (we share the information you provide in the support ticket) and professional services (we share your contact details to enable communication and collaboration).
For legal reasons
We share Service Data outside the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google if we have a good-faith belief that access to, or use, preservation, or disclosure of the Service Data is reasonably necessary to:
Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable agreements, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, Google, our customers, users, and the public as required or permitted by law.
If we or Google are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your Service Data and give affected users notice before Service Data becomes subject to a different privacy notice.
Access to Service Data
Your organization may allow you to access and export your data in order to back it up or transfer it to a third-party service. Some Services may enable you to directly access and download the data you have stored in the services.
You may be able to access certain categories of Service Data directly from the Services, such as your billing contact information, payment and transaction information, or certain product and communication settings and configurations.
If you’re unable to access your data, you can always request access via
our contact email address
below.
Deletion Or Retention Of Service Data
We retain Service Data for different periods of time depending on the type of data, how we use it, and how you configure your settings. When we no longer need such data, we delete or anonymize it.
For each type of Service Data and processing operation, we set retention timeframes based on the purposes for which we process it, and ensure that the information is kept for no longer than necessary. We retain most types of Service Data for a set period of up to 180 days (the exact number depends on the specific type of data). However, some data may be kept for longer periods where there is a business need. We generally have longer retention periods (which can be over a year) for Service Data that is kept for the following purposes:
Security, fraud and abuse prevention.
We retain Service Data to protect the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google, users, customers, and the public from security threats (including when it is necessary to protect against fraudulent attempts to gain access to user accounts), or to investigate violations of applicable Google Cloud Acquisitions agreements. Usually, the Service Data retained where there is reason to suspect fraud or abuse would include device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP addresses, as well as log data about usage of the Google Cloud Acquisitions Services.
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements.
We retain Service Data when required by an enforceable legal process, such as when the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google receives a lawful subpoena.
Complying with tax, accounting or financial requirements.
When the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google processes a payment for you, or when you make a payment to the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google, we retain Service Data about those transactions (including billing information), typically for a minimum of five years, as required for tax or accounting purposes, or to comply with applicable financial regulations.
At the end of the applicable retention period, we follow detailed protocols to make sure that the Service Data is securely and completely deleted from our active systems (the servers the Google Cloud Acquisitions or Google uses to run applications and store data) or retained only in anonymized form. After completion of these steps, copies of the data will remain for a limited period in our encrypted backup systems (which we maintain to protect this information from accidental or malicious deletion and for outage and disaster recovery purposes), before being overwritten by new backup copies.
EU Privacy Standards and GDPR
Exercising your data protection rights
If European Union (EU), UK, or Swiss data protection law applies to the processing of Service Data relating to you, you have certain rights, including the rights to access, correct, delete and export that information, and to object to or request that we restrict processing of your personal information.
The entities listed in
Annex 1
below. will be the data controllers responsible for your personal information. However, where you or our customer has entered into an agreement covering the Services with a different Google affiliate, that affiliate will be the data controller responsible for processing your Service Data, but only in connection with billing for the Services.
If you want to exercise your data protection rights with regard to Service Data we process in accordance with this Privacy Notice, and you are not able to do so via the tools available to you or your organization’s administrator, you can contact us via
our contact email address
