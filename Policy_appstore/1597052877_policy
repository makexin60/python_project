Our Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. Your privacy and security are our priorities.
1. Introduction
Welcome to Motion Blur ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our iOS applications and related services (collectively, the "Platforms").
2. Data Collection and Usage
We collect and process various types of data to enhance your experience with our Platforms:
Photos:
With your explicit consent, we temporarily access photos you upload via your device's camera or camera roll to provide editing functionalities. We do not collect your entire photo library, store photos in the cloud, or use them beyond the app's editing features. Please be aware that metadata (e.g., geotags) may be associated with your photos by default.
Face Recognition:
For effects like face pixelation, we employ face recognition technology to detect faces in photos and apply the desired effect.
Contact Information:
If you communicate with us via email, we may collect your name and email address to respond to your inquiries.
Correspondence Data:
Information you provide when requesting support or giving feedback helps us address issues and improve our services.
Session Data:
We collect technical data such as IP addresses, device identifiers, browser types, operating systems, geolocation, and timestamps to administer and enhance our Platforms' security and performance.
Cookies:
Our Platforms use cookies to improve functionality and user experience. Most web browsers accept cookies by default; you can adjust your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.
Preference Data:
Information you provide about your preferences allows us to tailor content and advertising to your interests.
Payment Data:
In-app purchases are processed through the App Store's payment system managed by Apple. We do not collect or process any payment information, such as credit card numbers or billing details.
3. Data Retention
We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill legal, regulatory, and business obligations. The retention period depends on the nature of the data and the purposes for which it was collected.
4. Your Rights
You have the right to:
Access the personal data we hold about you.
Request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
Request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal constraints.
Object to or restrict the processing of your data in certain circumstances.
Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at [Insert Contact Information].
5. Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure; thus, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated policy on our Platforms and indicating the effective date.
7. Contact Us
