Privacy Policy
Last update: May 17th, 2024
We participate in and comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and retention of Personal Data(defined in Section 2.1) from European Economic Area("EEA") member countries.
1. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA
XCEED S.R.L 
P. IVA #03373311202 
Address: Via Felice Casati 1/A, Milano (MI), 20124, Italy.
E-mail: info@xceed.me
2. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU
• Xceed S.r.l.'s main objective is to maintain your trust through respectful management of the personal information of Website Users and Buyers, giving them control over it. 
• It is important that you know what personal information Xceed S.r.l., (hereinafter 'we' or 'Xceed S.r.l.,') collects about you, and how we use it.
• For any further information, questions or concerns, please contact us using the details provided in the 'Contact' section.
• We will inform you appropriately if we make any material changes to our privacy practices at any time. If necessary, we will also ask for your permission.
3. PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
A) Provision of the service
• The online platform owned by Xceed S.r.l. is used by its clients and by event organisers to advertise and sell their tickets to people interested in purchasing them.
• The purpose for which we process your data is to collaborate in the management of the purchase of tickets to the event you wish to attend. The collaboration is to make available through our portal the catalogue of events advertised on our website. 
• The relationship of the purchase and sale of tickets will always be established between the buyer and the organiser of the event. 
• We will also send you electronic communications to promote and notify you of upcoming events in which you may be interested.
• There may be occasions when we collect your details for events where ticket sales are not yet available. In these cases of "pre-registration" we will only use your data for the sole purpose of notifying you when tickets go on sale for the event in which you are interested.

B) Sending commercial communications by electronic means to promote events
We may send you commercial communications by electronic means to notify you of new events and/or shows that we are promoting through our website.

C) Sending third party advertising
• Provided that you consent, we may send you advertising from third party companies interested in promoting their goods or services. 
• This advertising will be sent directly by Xceed S.r.l. without any physical delivery of your data to the advertisers. 
• This will involve the need to submit your personal data to standardisation, duplication, filtering and verification operations.

• We may send you advertising by e-mail, post, telephone calls to landlines or mobile phones, sending SMS and/or MMS messages, multi-platform messaging services, chat, automated calls without human intervention, push notifications, or any other type of similar communication.

D) Communication of your data for commercial purposes and commercial prospecting to third party companies.
• Provided that you consent, we may communicate your data to interested third parties such as companies, organisations and/or entities interested in carrying out marketing campaigns or market research.
• These advertisers may send you advertising through any of the following channels: email, post, telephone calls to landlines or mobiles, sending SMS and/or MMS messages, messaging services without human intervention or any other type of similar communication.
• This processing will necessarily involve the need to subject your personal data to standardisation, duplication, filtering and verification operations.
4. LEGITIMATION FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
A) Provision of the service
In relation to the provision of our services, we process your data because it is necessary for the execution of the contract, so that your opposition to the processing of your data would make it impossible for the Organiser of the event to receive your wish to purchase the tickets, making it impossible to carry out the provision of the service.

B) Promotion of events
In relation to the promotion of events through the sending of electronic communications, we send them based on our legitimate interest in keeping you informed about our news and upcoming events. In each communication you receive, we will give you the opportunity to object to the processing for promotional purposes.

C) Third-party advertising
• The only legitimation for the use of your data for commercial purposes and to be able to send you advertising from third parties interested in promoting their goods or services is your consent.
• Similarly, the legitimacy to communicate your personal data to third party companies, organizations and / or entities, for purposes of advertising, commercial prospecting or market research, will also be solely your consent.
• In the data registration form you will find two separate boxes, the ticking of which is in no way obligatory, so that you may or may not give us your consent for these purposes.
5. PRIVACY NOTICE
The way in which the privacy notice will be applied to users will depend on how they interact with us:
- If you purchase a ticket, we will use the information you provide to fulfil both our obligations to you and the organisers' obligations to you in providing that service, and, where permitted, to keep you informed about other events that may be of interest to you.
