Transfer of personal information outside of Brazil to countries that guarantee the same protection standards as LGPD
We can transfer your personal information outside of the Brazilian territory, if the destination country, or the international organization which receives the personal information, provides an adequate level of protection of the personal information according to the ANPD.
The ANPD authorizes such transfers whenever it considers that country to possess and provide personal information protection standards comparable to those set forth by the LGPD, having taken into account the following:
the general and sectoral rules of the legislation in force in the country of destination or in the international organization;
the nature of the personal information subject to the transfer;
the compliance with the general principles on the protection of the personal information and on the rights of the individuals as set forth in the LGPD;
the adoption of suitable security measures;
the existence of judicial and institutional guarantees for the respect of personal information protection rights; and
any other pertinent circumstance related to the relevant transfer.
