TECHNICAL files/cookies:
Firebase
is a Google development platform that serves as the technical backbone for applications, providing essential infrastructure support. It handles real-time database operations for instant updates, manages secure user authentication for logins and signups, and provides file storage capabilities for user uploads. The platform also monitors application performance and crashes, while offering server-side computing capabilities to handle complex operations.
Cloudflare
is a protective layer between your website and the internet, implementing crucial security measures against DDoS attacks and malicious traffic. It enhances website performance by caching content closer to users (CDN) and optimizing the delivery of images and code. Additionally, Cloudflare provides SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure connections between users and your website and mobile app.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
provides the fundamental infrastructure to run applications and websites. It offers servers for hosting, scalable storage solutions for files and data, and powerful computing resources for handling complex tasks. AWS manages databases, provides AI/ML services, and delivers content through its global network. A key feature is its ability to automatically scale resources based on demand, ensuring consistent performance during usage spikes.
Google Analytics
is configured for anonymous data collection and monitors website and application technical performance. It tracks system stability, monitors for technical errors and crashes, and measures critical metrics like page load times and server response rates. The service helps identify technical bottlenecks that might affect performance and provides comprehensive system health monitoring, including detailed reports on service availability and uptime.
Intercom
is a customer communication platform that enables real-time messaging between users and support teams through live chat and help center features. The platform manages message delivery and storage while handling user authentication for conversations. Additionally, Intercom tracks technical interactions to ensure reliable message delivery and provides insights into system performance.
‚ö†Ô∏è On top of that, we also use an IP Anonymizer. An IP anonymizer is a tool or feature that anonymizes IP addresses before any data storage occurs, making them permanently unidentifiable to protect user privacy. It sets the last octet of the IP address to zero. For example, 92.168.12.144 will be set to 92.168.12.0.
