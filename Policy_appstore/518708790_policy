Effective Date: July 31, 2023
This privacy policy describes how KeepCalling collects and uses the personal information you provide on the website and app: KeepCalling.com, a service of Miron Enterprises, LLC ("Miron") dba KeepCalling, one of the largest ethnic telecommunication providers in the world based in Atlanta, Georgia.
The scope of this Privacy Policy encompasses all services, sites, brands, and applications owned by Miron Enterprises, LLC ("Miron") doing business as KeepCalling, except where explicitly stated otherwise.
At KeepCalling we care about the privacy of our visitors and we are committed to protecting your private data at all times. This privacy policy describes how KeepCalling collects and uses the personal information, why we collect it and how we use it for our web site: KeepCalling.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our website visitors and service users, in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.
We will not collect any of your personal information that you do not volunteer to make available or consent to for further action. We do not sell, share, or rent this personal information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at customerservice@keepcalling.com.
Personal information we collect
The data collected by keepcalling.com is initially managed and processed by the owning company, Miron Enterprises, LLC ("Miron") doing business as KeepCalling. Additionally, any information gathered by the company is further shared with the app developer Miron Enterprises (KeepCalling).
Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Personal information we collect from you when you use our Services
Account information
We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. This information is used only to fulfill your specific request or process your order, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of our contact lists.
User Messages
We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers.
Contact Lists
The app imports the phone numbers from your provided Contacts List to calculate the costs of calls and texts. Specifically, the cost calculation is based on the destination country prefix, with consideration for certain phone numbers that have special costs. We verify and provide the user with the accurate cost of service based on these specific numbers. It's important to note that we only access and use the phone numbers for this purpose; we do not collect any other information from your device's address book, such as names or email addresses.
There are certain features like Speed Dial that allow the app to collect and store contact information, including names and phone numbers, only when the user grants permission. This information is securely stored in our database and linked to the user's account. Consequently, whenever the user logs in to another device, the saved phone numbers are accessible on that device as well. We do not share the contact details with any other third party. The user’s data remains confidential and protected within our system.
Calling service
To deliver the calling service, the app uses your phone's microphone to read your audio message and transfer it to the other party you are talking to. The app has NO audio Record function.

What is a cookie?
A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers.
Most websites you visit use cookies to improve your user experience by allowing the website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).
What do cookies do?
Cookies have lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site, for example, even after you "log in," if you move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.
How does KeepCalling use cookies?
KeepCalling and its partners use technologies such as cookies, or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and remember our users' settings (e.g. language preference, location etc), or for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
What third-party cookies does KeepCalling use?
Trusted partners like ​Firebase, Facebook, Twitter, SendGrid, Quora​ etc and analytics companies like Google Analytics​ may also place cookies on your device. Please read our partners' privacy policies to ensure that you're comfortable with how they use cookies.
What should you do if you don’t want cookies to be set?
If you prefer, you may choose to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set; but you should be aware that you might lose some functions of the website.
If you want to restrict or block the cookies that are set by our Site, or any other site, you can do so through your browser setting. The ‘Help’ function in your browser should explain how.

Our presence across the Internet is the outcome of this matching of users' preference and products available. In order to reach the right audience, the external companies we collaborate with (like Google or Quantcast) may use certain information to establish consumers' habits: visits to a website, goods and services to determine or predict our visitors' characteristics, behavior, or preferences.
Anonymous data collected from visits to our websites is matched by external companies to larger pools of data (from more websites) to deliver ads to people with similar browsing pattern to our visitors. Thus, consumers receive more relevant ads and advertisers benefit from more effective advertising.
