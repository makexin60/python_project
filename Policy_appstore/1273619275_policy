Join smartphone users across the world and help fight coronavirus while you sleep
Introducing DreamLab - an award-winning app from Vodafone Foundation that enables thousands of people to help speed up vital health research while they sleep. DreamLab was developed in 2015 to support cancer research projects, and has already supported four world-first discoveries in cancer research, including anti-cancer properties in existing foods and drugs.
Now that collective processing power is also being used to help combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).

Charge
Download the DreamLab app, choose a project to support, and each time your phone is plugged in, charged, and connected to the internet, you’ll be helping speed up vital scientific research. (iOS users will need to press Power DreamLab).
Sleep
Charge your phone overnight and, while you sleep, DreamLab taps into its unused processing power to support vital health research.
Fight coronavirus
Alongside thousands of other DreamLab users, you’ll be using your phone to power a virtual supercomputer, capable of processing billions of calculations – and helping research into better ways to fight coronavirus.
How DreamLab is helping speed up vital health research…
Every time you use the DreamLab app, you’ll be supporting vital scientific health studies. The Corona-AI research project involves analysing billions of combinations of existing drugs and food molecules to identify how they can be adjusted to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment for coronavirus.

The app has already supported four world-first discoveries in cancer research.
And the mobile data is on us …
If you’re a Vodafone customer, and using your phone while connected to our mobile network, we won’t charge you for the data to power DreamLab. The app can also be used across other networks, with users choosing how much data they wish to donate, or connecting via Wi-Fi. None of your personal data will be downloaded or processed from your device.
So you can sleep easy, knowing you’re helping to fight coronavirus, and it won’t cost you a thing. See our FAQs and Terms and Conditions for full details.
Frequently asked questions:
Android Users
How does it work?
Your smartphone is a small but powerful computer. When it's idle – like when you're asleep at night – that power goes untapped. DreamLab puts that power to good use to fast-track cancer research. When you power DreamLab, your phone will receive tiny problems to process and solve, and send the results back to the research team.
How do I start using DreamLab?
DreamLab will automatically start when your phone is plugged in and is at least 80% charged. You can also choose to press ‘Power DreamLab’ at any time.
How do I stop using DreamLab?
To stop using DreamLab, simply unplug your phone or press ‘End Session’ on the DreamLab app. To stop using DreamLab permanently, uninstall the app.
Will it access private information on my phone?
No. DreamLab does not access private information on your phone.
The app requests access to photos and media folders in order to store tiny research problems while they’re being processed and solved by your phone. However, DreamLab will only access the files it’s created in the file directories and won’t access any of your private information or photos. You can read the DreamLab privacy policy in the app settings.
Will it drain my battery?
DreamLab will work automatically when your phone is plugged in and has at least 80% charge. If you choose to use DreamLab when your phone isn’t on charge, then, like any application, it will utilise battery power.
Will DreamLab use data from my mobile plan, or Wi-Fi?
DreamLab needs data to download the research problems from the cloud, and send the results back.
If your phone detects that Wi-Fi is available, then DreamLab will work over Wi-Fi. DreamLab is automatically set to use unlimited Wi-Fi data, but you can change this any time in the app Settings.
If Wi-Fi isn’t available, then DreamLab will work over your mobile network. You can set a monthly data contribution limit (50MB, 250MB or 500MB), and it’ll only continue using data until it reaches that amount. If you don’t want DreamLab to use any mobile data, you can turn mobile data off in the app Settings.
Vodafone customers won’t be charged for any mobile data used by DreamLab in the UK or in our
Roam-free destinations [PDF: 668KB
]
For roaming outside the UK and the Roam-free destinations you’ll be charged our
standard data roaming charges
for the country you’re visiting.
Vodafone Pay as you go customers must have credit on their account for DreamLab to work over our network (though it’ll still work over Wi-Fi).
If you aren’t a Vodafone UK customer, you’ll be charged according to your mobile price plan for the data you contribute.
Please note: Vodafone Enterprise customers using a non-Vodafone APN setting (for example, using their organisation’s APN setting or VPN) will be charged according to their mobile price plan.
Please note: DreamLab works on a calendar month, which might not be in sync with your billing cycle. You can see when your DreamLab monthly cycle will restart in the app settings. DreamLab will pause when you reach the monthly data limit that you’ve chosen. At this point, you’ll be given the choice to increase your data contribution or enable Wi-Fi. If you do nothing, DreamLab will simply resume again at the start of the next calendar month.
How do I only use DreamLab over Wi-Fi?
Go to the DreamLab app settings, and set mobile data to 0MB.
How much data will DreamLab use?
It’s up to you. On your mobile network, you can choose to give up to 50MB, 250MB or 500MB a month. For Wi-Fi, you can choose to give up to 500MB, 1GB or unlimited data each month. You can change how much data you contribute at any time in the DreamLab app settings.
As a guide, 50MB is about the same as uploading 25 photos to social media a month. 500MB is approximately equivalent to streaming a video for 1.5 hours a month. 1GB is similar to streaming a video for 3 hours a month. You can see how much data DreamLab has used and when your month restarts in the app settings.
I’m travelling abroad. What should I do with DreamLab?

How does DreamLab help fast-track cancer research?
One thing slowing cancer research is the limited access researchers have to supercomputers to crunch their complex data. DreamLab gives researchers access to a dedicated virtual supercomputer to accelerate research into cancers including breast, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, lung, brain, sarcoma and melanoma. To find out about the projects that DreamLab currently supports, visit the Project Tab in the app.
