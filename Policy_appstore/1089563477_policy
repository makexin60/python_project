Reading editions & My Library

To start reading just follow these simple steps:
Make your purchase on Pocketmags.com
Ensure you are logged into your account. Your magazines will appear in the My Library section of the site (accessed in the top navigation). Click on a cover to start reading.
In the reader you can use various controls to navigate an edition:
Turn the page: Cursor keys/ Click arrows on screen/ Two finger horizontal swipe on trackpad/ Click and drag the page
Zoom: Scroll-wheel up and down/ Double click the mouse/ Two finger vertical swipe on trackpage/ Click magnifying glass
The menu bar options provide various other options such as jumping to pages, viewing in vertical scroll mode etc.
If you're using an older web browser version and having trouble with the web reader you can try clicking the 3 dots below an issue in My Library and clicking 'Old Reader'.
If you have a compatible mobile or tablet device you can download one of our leading apps so that you can enjoy your editions offline and on the go.
Click here for Apple App Store
(iPhone and iPad)
Click here for Google Play
(Android mobile and tablet)
Click here for Amazon App Store
(Kindle Fire)
Once the app is downloaded simply login with your Pocketmags and username to sync your library. Detailed instructions on mobile and tablet reading can be found at:
https://pocketmags.com/how-it-works
*The Kindle Fire app no longer receives regular updates, for this reason, we are unable to guarantee ongoing access in future.
Subscriptions (how they work, subscription management)
Subscriptions save you money compared to buying individual issues and are available for fixed periods, such as 3 months or 12 months. Upon subscribing, you gain immediate access to the current issue, along with all other regular issues released during your subscription term. New issues will appear in your My Library area on the Pocketmags website or app when they are released. They can continue to be read in My Library after your subscription ends.
Some titles offer 'all-access' subscriptions, which will be indicated on the purchase page. All-access subscriptions provide access to new issues as they are released, as well as all regular back issues of the title (that are available on Pocketmags) for the duration of your subscription, via My Library. Once the subscription ends, access to all issues is lost.
Your subscription will renew automatically, so if you want to continue subscribing you don't need to do anything and your next subscription will auto-renew. If you'd prefer to cancel the auto-renewal, you must do this at least 24 hours before your next payment is due to be taken.
If you would like to
cancel
the renewal of a subscription this can be done in the
My Subscriptions
section of the My Account area of the website. If you are looking to cancel a subscription purchased in an app please follow our instructions
here
.

My Account & Loyalty Scheme
Can I checkout as guest or do I need a Pocketmags account?
It’s not possible to checkout as a guest. This is because your purchases need to be linked to a Pocketmags account. This is then used to login to the Pocketmags website or apps at any time to read your digital editions.
A Pocketmags account allows you to access, sync and read your purchases on multiple devices, such as your home computer and your Apple, Android or Amazon devices.
An account also protects all your purchases in the case of a lost or stolen device and allows you to earn loyalty points which can be used to reduce the cost of future purchases
How do I change my username or password? (/ I have forgotten my password)
Change Username or Password:
Please login to the Pocketmags site then visit My Account and select 'Change email address' or 'Change password'.
Forgotten Password:
If you have forgotten your password you can reset it here:
https://pocketmags.com/forgot-password
Please note that passwords are case sensitive and must be between 8 & 20 characters in length. They must contain at least 1 upper case character, 1 lower case and 1 number.
If you have not received a password reset email this could mean either that the email has ended up in your junk/spam folder, that there is no Pocketmags account registered to your email address or there may be another problem.Please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
if you continue to have trouble or the above has not helped.
How do I manage the number of emails I receive from Pocketmags?
There are two types of emails from Pocketmags:
Service emails - relating to your account and new issue notifications for active subscriptions.
Marketing emails - which tend to be offers and promotions that we think you will be interested in.
Service emails can not be unsubscribed from but you can manage your new issue notifications in the
My Notifications
section of your account.
Marketing emails can be unsubscribed from by clicking the 'Unsubscribe' button at the foot of the email.
What is the Pocketmags loyalty scheme? How do I earn (and spend) Pocketmags points?
The Pocketmags loyalty scheme offers you the chance to earn loyalty points as you shop on our website. Every time you shop on pocketmags.com, you earn 2 points for every 1 of your currency e.g. $1 = 2 points, £1 = 2 points (unless otherwise stated). Please note that your points are linked to the currency of your purchases, switching currency and making purchases would give you a separate points balance in each currency
These points can then be used to purchase other products on our site. To use your Points simply enter the quantity of Points you wish to redeem at the Checkout and click on ‘Use Points’. The value of your Points will then be deducted from your purchase price.
Further details about Pocketmags Points can be found here:
https://pocketmags.com/pocketmags-points
Is it possible to merge two Pocketmags accounts?
If you have two (or more) Pocketmags accounts - for example, if you have accidentally created an account with a different/new email address rather than using your existing account - we can merge these for you. Please let us know your two usernames and which one you would like to keep. We will then merge the accounts into the one you would like to keep.
Please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
requesting an account merge from the email address that will be replaced, or providing proof of purchase from this account.
How do I delete my Pocketmags account?
You can permanently delete your Pocketmags account through the Pocketmags web site or the Pocketmags iOS app by following the instructions below.

Click
here
to visit our Activation hub.
From the drop-down menu please select the relevant title and click the orange button 'Go to Activation Page'.
Enter your activation details provided by the publisher.
Click 'Activate'.

help@pocketmags.com
. To enable us to assist you, we will require the activation credentials and instructions that the publisher has provided you with.
An issue has been released but it's not in my account even though I have an active subscription. How can I access this?
Occasionally publishers release special issues which are not included in a subscription and need to be purchased individually.
However, if a regular issue has been released and you have an active subscription but the issue has not been added to your account, please do the following:
If you purchased through one of our apps (rather than the website), please try the Restore Purchases function found in the Options menu of the app you originally purchased in.
If you purchased through the Pocketmags website (or have synced a publisher subscription with your Pocketmags account) please ensure that you are still logged in to the website or app with the Pocketmags account you made the purchase with.
If this does not resolve the problem, please contact
help@pocketmags.com
with your purchase receipt and Pocketmags username. (If you purchased through an app and do not yet have a Pocketmags account, please create one via the Options menu, then send us your username and purchase receipt).
I have been notified that the title I subscribe to has ceased publication - what will happen to my subscription?
In this situation, an official notification from the publishers will be sent to you advising you what happens next. If you have not been notified please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
with your Pocketmags username and we will look into this for you.
I have seen a new issue in the shops but it is not yet available digitally / in my account?
Please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
notifying us of the title in question and your Pocketmags username and we will investigate. Very occasionally publishers choose to release their digital version later than print, though this is not common.
I’ve ordered a subscription. When will it start?
Your subscription will begin immediately, starting with the current issue.
Subscription periods are time based, running from the date of purchase for the duration purchased e.g. 12 months. At the end of the subscription it will automatically renew unless the renewal has been switched-off previously. New editions will be delivered to your Pocketmags Library on web and in-app as they are released for the duration of your subscription. A handful of titles offer 'all-access' subscriptions, which include back issue access for the duration of your subscription, this will be stated on the purchase page.
Please note that Special Editions are not included in subscriptions (unless otherwise stated).
I am a print subscriber, do I get digital for free?
If digital access is included within your print subscription it will be explicitly stated by the publisher, and activation instructions will be provided. Otherwise digital access is not included. It is best to contact the publisher directly if you are not sure.
Cancellation and refunds
I no longer want my purchase, am I eligible for a refund?
Purchases of magazines, newspapers, publications and products through Pocketmags.com are non-refundable after content has been purchased and viewed. Refunds will not be given for an active subscription period, but you may turn off subsequent auto-renewals in
My Subscriptions
. Any refund requests may be denied and an administration fee may be applied in any case where they are approved.
If your purchase was made through an app or App Store then refunds are reviewed by the platform of sale (e.g. Apple, Google Play) according to their own terms and conditions, please contact them via your order receipt.
You can refer to our
Terms and Conditions
here to find out more, or alternatively, you can contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
for further information. Please provide us with your username and purchase receipt in correspondence.

Pocketmags website
, to cancel a recurring subscription please click here:
https://pocketmags.com/membersarea/mysubscriptions
and then click the 'Cancel renewal' option.

Reading & My Library
Library management (archiving, bookmarks, sorting)
Library View
You can use the settings/options menu in your library to choose your preferred way of viewing your library, for example sorting by issue or grouping by title.
Library Management & Archiving Issues
Pocketmags offers an ‘archive’ option, which will remove an issue from your primary library though it can be retrieved if you change your mind.
To archive an issue select the 3 dots below that issue in your library and select 'Archive'. To view your archived issues go to My Library at Pocketmags.com and select 'Show: Archived Issues' in the drop down below the 'My Library' label. To unarchive an issue you can select the 3 dots below an archived issue and select 'Unarchive'.
If you’re just looking to free up space on your mobile or tablet device you can simply delete the download by clicking the 3 dots and selecting Delete. This will stay in your main library and can be re-downloaded any time in future. If you’re reading at Pocketmags.com the edition is downloaded each time you read it so there is no delete option (though you can archive, see above).
Bookmarks
To add a bookmark from within the reader select the bookmark symbol from the Options menu. In the apps you will need to tap the screen once when reading to bring up the menu, then tap the bookmark icon.
To access existing bookmarks you can do this from your Pocketmags library (on web or in the iOS or Google Play Pocketmags app) by going to the Bookmarks folder in your Library.
Your last read page in an issue will be saved locally, e.g. if you re-open an issue on the same device you will return to your last read page, but this is not yet saved across device.
If you need further assistance please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
.
Can I read offline?
All of our mobile and tablet apps allow offline reading. Once an issue has been downloaded you can read it with or without an internet or wifi connection.
Click here for Apple App Store
(iPhone and iPad)
Click here for Google Play
(Android mobile and tablet)
Click here for Amazon App Store
(Kindle Fire)
Detailed instructions on mobile and tablet reading can be found here:
https://pocketmags.com/how-it-works
I’ve downloaded an issue, but it won’t load correctly (e.g. missing pages, corrupt text, issue not loading, faulty download). How can I fix this?

On Pocketmags.com (reading in your browser):
Exit the issue, then re-launch. Also try pressing CTRL+SHIFT+R to hard refresh the browser.
On one of our apps:
Please try to delete and redownload the issue. To delete the current download please go to My Library and then tap the 3 dots by an issue and select Delete (alternatively use the bin icon in the top right, then select what you want to delete and confirm). Once this is done exit the app, re-open and then try to download again.

If the problem persists please go to Options then 'Contact Us' and provide us with details of the edition and fault, we will then investigate.
Managing my library in-app (including delete, archive, auto-delete)
How to delete:
Deleting an issue will remove the download from your device, freeing up space. You can download it again at any time in the future. To delete an issue go to My Library then tap the 3 dots below a cover and select delete.
Archiving:
You can move editions out of your main My Library folder by tapping the 3 dots below a cover and selecting 'Archive'. You can retrieve editions by tapping 'Archived' in your library and unarchiving them in the same way.
Auto-delete of Plus+ downloads:
To free up space on your device, Plus+ downloads will auto-delete if they have not been read for a certain amount of time (default 90 days). You can change this, or turn it off, by tapping the Options button then 'Manage Downloaded Issues'.
Bookmarks:
Any bookmarks you have saved can be viewed by tapping Bookmarks in My Library. If the edition is not downloaded you will be able to view just the bookmarked page or download the edition. You can also delete bookmarks from here.
Reading an edition
Tap on the cover of an edition that you own to download and read it. Once in the reader:
Hold your device in portrait to view one page at a time.
Hold your device in landscape to view two pages at a time.
To turn pages, swipe horizontally.
To zoom in, use a two-finger pinch out (/ spread) gesture or double tap. Once zoomed, drag to pan around the page you are viewing.
To zoom back out, use a pinch gesture or double tap the page again.
Tap once to bring up the reading menu, this includes a thumbnail scroller, contents button and other controls dependent on the issue. Tap again to minimise the menu.
To add a bookmark, tap once to bring up the menu then tap the bookmark icon.
To exit the issue and return to the library, tap once to bring up the menu and tap the back arrow in the top left.
I am having trouble logging in to the app
We recommend you turn your device on and off to reconnect the signal, or try switching connection e.g. from wi-fi to data.
If you have forgotten your Pocketmags password please go to Options > Login/ Register then click Forgotten Password. Please ensure that you are logging into the app with the same Pocketmags username and password as you use on the Pocketmags website.
If your subscription was bought directly from the publisher please visit the '
Activate a Subscription
' page on
Pocketmags.com
to link your subscription to a Pocketmags account, then login to this app with the same Pocketmags username and password. If you are receiving an error when activating this should contain details for contacting the publisher to enquire why there is a problem.
If you continue to have trouble, or have not received a Forgotten Password email, please go to Options then '
Contact Us
' or email
info@pocketmags.com
with details of the problem you are having.
My app is stuck on the initial launch screen. How do I fix this?
We recommend deleting the app and then redownloading it from the App Store. This will be free of charge as your original purchase will be linked to your app account.
If you continue to experience problems, please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
with details such as which app and we will be happy to assist.
My app is repeatedly crashing. How do I resolve this?
If an app is repeatedly crashing please try a reset of your device and then re-launch the app.
iOS devices:
To do a hard reset, please hold the home button and sleep button together until the Apple logo displays on the screen.
Android devices:
To do a hard reset for an Android device, please hold the volume up and power button together.
If this does not resolve the issue please contact us at
info@pocketmags.com
. Please provide as much detail as possible, such as which device you are using and when it is crashing (particularly if it is repeatedly happening at the same point)
I am unable to download the latest version of the Pocketmags app
Due to device restrictions it is not always possible to update to the latest versions of apps. This is generally the case with older devices, such as iPads which are only able to go up to a certain iOS. In this situation we will try to maintain access via our older app versions but sadly can not guarantee this. If the app on your device no longer works we recommend accessing Pocketmags.com via the web browser on your device.
What's the difference between Pocketmags and a magazine's 'branded' app on Apple / Google Play?  Can I download an app just for the magazine / newspaper I want to order?
Pocketmags allows you to purchase and store a wide variety of magazines in one single app rather than having individual apps for each title.
We do power the ‘branded’ apps for a number of magazines available on Pocketmags. These are apps which solely offer that one title rather than all of Pocketmags.
To find these please search the App Store for the title in question, if Pocketmags powers them then details regarding Pocketmags accounts will be available in the app description.
Please note that there are titles on the site where we do not do the ‘branded’ app, for example if the publisher does it themselves. In this case you will not be able to read a Pocketmags purchase in the title’s branded app, and a purchase through the specific app can not be read on Pocketmags, as the two systems will not be linked.
If you have any questions please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
and we will be happy to assist.

Why are my purchases not showing up on my device? (/ I am being asked to pay again)
Please ensure you are logged in to the Pocketmags site or app with the same Pocketmags username that you made your purchases with. The app or website should synchronise with your account and the same magazines should be available to read in the '
My Library
' section regardless of device.
However, if a regular issue has been released and you have an active subscription but content is still not in your My Library section, please do the following:
If you purchased through one of our apps (rather than the website), please try the Restore Purchases function found in the Settings menu of the app you originally purchased in.
If you purchased through the Pocketmags website (or have synced a publisher subscription with your Pocketmags account) please ensure that you are still logged in to the website or app with the Pocketmags account you made the purchase with.
If you purchased directly through the publisher's website, or are a print subscriber eligible for digital access, please ensure that you have activated your digital access by linking it to your Pocketmags account:
https://pocketmags.com/activate-subscription-hub
Please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
if you continue to have trouble or the above has not helped.
I have been charged multiple times for the same purchase
This occasionally happens if the 'pay now' button is pressed multiple times by mistake or if there is an issue with the system processing the payment.
Please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
with details of what has happened and we will be happy to assist you.
My purchase has been made in the wrong currency
If your purchase has been made in the wrong currency please contact us at
help@pocketmags.com
with further details (such as your username and order number).
I want a free trial, but am being asked to provide my payment card details. Why?
As with many free trial offers, you are asked to enter your credit or debit card details as part of the sign up process, payment will be taken from this card at the end of the trial for the agreed post-trial price. You have the option to cancel the subscription before the end of the trial period and if you do, no payment will be taken.
After downloading a magazine subscription trial, if you don't want to continue with the subscription after the end of the trial period, please ensure you cancel it at least 24 hours before the free trial period ends (normally 30 days or less), otherwise you will be charged the full subscription rate. Instructions on cancelling an auto-renewal can be found
here
.
I no longer want my purchase, am I eligible for a refund?
Purchases of digital magazines, newspapers, publications and products through Pocketmags.com are non-refundable after content has been purchased and viewed. Refunds will not be given for an active subscription period, but you may turn off subsequent auto-renewals in
My Subscriptions
. Any refund requests may be denied and an administration fee may be applied in any case where they are approved.
If your purchase was made through an app or App Store then refunds are reviewed by the platform of sale (e.g. Apple, Google Play) according to their own terms and conditions, please contact them via your order receipt.

For detailed information regarding the Cookies we use and the purposes we use them for, please refer to our
Cookie Policy
. We may also collect this kind of information when you interact with email messages or other communications we send you. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognise your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use our services. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email; they are designed to collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates, measure the popularity of our services and associated advertising, and access cookies. We and our vendors (including Google Analytics) also use these technologies and the information collected by them for data analytics purposes. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of our services.
We may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers, and others) on our services that use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant and targeted content and advertising to you as you browse the internet. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect about you.

How do we help to keep your data safe and secure?
The security of your personal data is important to us. We have put in place appropriate security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, or modification of your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet and no means of electronic or physical storage is absolutely secure. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it (e.g., encryption of more sensitive data elements such as payment information). When you give your personal data to Jellyfish we will process that data in accordance with our responsibilities.
To prevent unauthorised access, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the correct usage of information, we monitor and adjust our physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your personal data while in our care, or in the care of any outside suppliers with whom we may contract to process your data on our behalf. Any outside suppliers are under strict contractual terms to mirror the security policies that we currently have in place.
Data retention
We will keep personal data only for as long as we need it to maintain our relationship with our contacts, provide them with the products, services or information they have requested, to inform our research into the preferences of our customers /clients, to comply with the law, to ensure we do not communicate with individuals that have asked us not to, and for other necessary purposes, like resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and for fraud prevention and related security purposes.. When we no longer need the information, we will dispose of it securely, using specialist companies to do this work for us if necessary.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.
Disclosing information to others
Primarily we use your information within Jellyfish in order to provide you with the service or product you have selected.
We will only disclose your information to specific third parties in the following circumstances:
To facilitate the service of a physical product, for example providing appropriate details (such as name, address, payment details as applicable) to the Product Owner of a print magazine subscription or subscription box.
We may use partners to help manage, monitor and optimise our Services to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications and how visitors use the Services.
If you have provided consent to receive marketing correspondence from the Product Owner of a product you have purchased through one of our Services, your data will be disclosed to them and/or the data processor authorised to operate on their behalf for the specific purposes to which you consented. In each of the above cases, the Product Owner will have their own privacy policy which will cover their use of your personal data.
Where we need to do so in order to provide a service you have requested. For example online transactions with us are secured using the SSL encryption method and hosted with our third party payment providers including Stripe, MPP Global Solutions Ltd, SagePay Europe Ltd and PayPal. This is to provide enhanced security and protection to our customers. All our payments processed via PayPal are processed via PayPal References Transactions.
We may use certain third party services to verify your identity in certain circumstances, such as that your postcode is valid for delivery, age for age restricted products and company checks.
It may be necessary to disclose information to certain third party industry bodies, such as the ABC or BPA, for audit and accreditation purposes, to confirm that sales have taken place.
To improve the service and advertising that you receive (on our Services and third party websites and apps). These activities may involve the use of cookies or similar technologies. For more information please review the “Cookies, similar technologies, and online advertising” section below and read our
Cookie Policy
.
If disclosure is required or permitted by law. We will always ensure that those requesting the information have the legal right to do so.
If another company should purchase any of our companies or assets, including our database, that company will have the right of possession of the personal data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations formerly attributable to us.
Data Transfers
We may transfer your personal data to a Product Owner based outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA), in a country with less stringent data protection laws. Where we do so we take the necessary steps to comply with applicable legal requirements and ensure any necessary appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place, so that your personal data is treated securely and your rights are respected. For further information about the documents we use to protect your information when it is transferred outside your country or region, please submit a request to
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
.
Your rights and choices
Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights and choices under data protection laws:
Rights regarding your information.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make certain requests regarding your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law). Specifically, you may have the following rights:
Direct Marketing:
You have the right to object to receiving direct marketing from us. You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails via the unsubscribe link provided in the emails or by emailing us at privacy@jellyfishconnect.com. Please note that it may take us some time, consistent with our legal obligations, to process your request. Even if you opt out from receiving marketing messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us, such as order confirmations, updates to our policies and practices, or other communications regarding our relationship or transactions with you.
Access:
You have the right to be provided with the information we hold for you or general information about the categories of personal data we process about you. This is known as a ‘Subject Access Request’.
Rectification:
If the information we hold for you is incorrect or needs amending, please let us know and we will update our records. Where available, you may view and amend these yourself in the My Account area of the relevant Service’s website.
Delete Data/Right to erasure and Account Closure
- you can ask us to erase or delete all of your personal data and record with us. If at any time you would like to close and delete an account please contact privacy@jellyfishconnect.com. Your personal data will be removed from our active user database and will be deleted assuming that you are current with all payment obligations, that Jellyfish does not believe it reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action, and that we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information. Please be aware that any unfulfilled subscriptions may be cancelled without refund, you will have to re-register in order to use the respective Service again, and any existing purchases will be forfeited. It is your responsibility to request a refund from Jellyfish or the appropriate merchant or Product Owner.
Restrict processing:
You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy,
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it,
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims,
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Data portability:
You have the right to have provided to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent:
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Non-discrimination:
We are committed to ensuring that you will not be denied services, charged a different price, or provided a different level or quality of services just because you exercised your rights under applicable law. Please note, however, that we may need some personal data in order to provide you our services, which means that we may not be able to provide some of our services if you refuse to provide your personal data.
We may need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address.
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorised agent to be verified, you must provide the authorised agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorised agent’s request.
Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. If we deny your request, we will provide you with information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable, in our communications with you.
If you would like further information regarding your legal rights or would like to exercise any of them, please email us at

“Sale” and “Sharing” of Personal Information.
United States data law defines the “sale” of data as “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration”.  “Sharing” is defined as “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer‘s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.”
As explained in the “How We Disclose Information We Collect” section of our Privacy Policy, we provide personal information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our services, and use related analytics partners to assist us in analysing the effectiveness of our online advertisements. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or, the “sharing” of your personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioural advertising.”
The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have “sold” or “shared” over the last 12 months and the categories of third parties to which we have “sold” or “shared:”

As a United States resident, depending on the state in which you reside, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/use of your information for targeted advertising.”
If you would like to opt out of our online disclosure such as through cookie and pixel technology of your personal data for purposes that could be considered “sales” for those third parties' own commercial purposes, or “sharing” for purposes of targeted advertising, please click the "My Privacy Choices" link in our website footer and follow the instructions. You can also submit a request to opt out of our offline disclosures of information that are subject to applicable opt out rights by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
. Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may be permitted to designate an authorised agent to submit such requests on your behalf. If you have a legally-recognised browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognise such preference in accordance with applicable law.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal data of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorisation.
“Shine the Light” Disclosure.
You can exercise your rights under the California “Shine the Light” law – which gives you the right to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes – by emailing us at
privacy@jellyfishconnect.com
.
Retention.
We will retain your data as described above in the “Data retention” section of our Privacy Policy.
Notice of Financial Incentives.
We may offer opportunities to receive certain benefits, such as discounts, promotion entries, or other similar incentives, which may require the provision of personal data, such as answering surveys or providing additional feedback or information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”). Your participation in Incentive Programs is purely voluntary. When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program. The monetary value of the reward, discount, or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of participation in the Incentive Program.
Notice Concerning Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, which is why we describe a variety of opt-out mechanisms above. However, we do not currently recognise or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about
Do Not Track
. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced above, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” of your information or the "sharing” of your information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.
