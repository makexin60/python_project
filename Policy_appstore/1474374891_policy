Phone Policy
We are aware many members wish to use their smartphones whilst working out, be it for playing music, to tracking fitness progress to snapping an image of what they are doing and sharing it with their friends.
Athlone RSC sets out below a very simple and clear policy regarding smartphone usage whilst using our facilities.
Mobile Phone / Smartphone Usage is allowed where an individual wants to capture a photographic or video image, whilst on our gym floor or within our Fitness Class Studio areas only.
Under no circumstances should mobile phone us be used whilst in Changing room or Pool areas
When using your phone to video or snap a picture, you must be aware that all members / users have privacy rights and certainly you have no authorization to include any other member or gym user in your imagery without their strict permission.
At Athlone RSC, we are very aware that social media often creates a false reality. Perfect bodies associated with the proper lighting, at the right time of day, and with the proper filter often create an unrealistic view of what the human body looks like. Some clients strive for or obsess over these looks and in some cases go to drastic lengths to try to achieve them. The desire to look a certain way–an unrealistic way–can be damaging to an individual’s
mental (and overall) health and body image.
Please be aware of this.
For the comfort of other users and your own safety, please don’t take or make calls while exercising. Other members don’t want to hear your phone conversations.
Please don’t Be a gym camper i.e. occupy a piece of equipment to scroll through your social media ooblivious to the fact that people are waiting to use the machine you are occupying.
Please remember, there are many members who don’t wish to use their phones whilst exercising. Many members wish to clear their minds and focus on their whilst exercising and this should be always respected.
Many Thanks
Athlone RSC
