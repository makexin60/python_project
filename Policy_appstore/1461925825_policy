are deleted immediately after successful Avatars generation.  At the same time,
your Avatars
(not face data) are stored on our servers (provided by Google Cloud Platform and, or, Amazon Web Services) to be available to you at any time from any device until you decide to delete them (e.g., within the app or via a request you send us at

PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your "personal information" (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA")).
Categories of personal information we collect.
Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail how we collect, use, and disclose personal information about our users. Under the CCPA, we are also required to provide you with the relevant "categories" of personal information we collect. The categories we collect include: identifiers (such as name, username, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, or other similar identifiers); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history and information on interaction with the Services); geolocation data (general location information at an IP-based or city/state/zip level or precise location); demographic information (such as age and gender); physical characteristics or description (such as photos and videos of you); biometric information (for use in creating avatars), and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (e.g., information you voluntarily provide as you use the PiñataFarms services or our any of our family of apps, such as additional profile information or user-generated content). Some of this information (i.e., precise location and biometric information) are deemed “sensitive personal information” under the CCPA.
The sources from which the categories of personal information are collected and uses.
We collect the personal information from the following categories of sources: directly from you and the information you provide to us; indirectly from our affiliates, service providers, and third parties with whom you have a direct relationship; other users that may post content containing your image; and indirectly through your use of the Services.
Use and disclosure of categories of personal information.
For information about how we use and disclose the information we collect from and about you, see the “How We Use Your Information” and “How We Disclose Your Information” sections above. Please note that the CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” or “share” personal information to/with third parties. We do not engage in such activities.[JS8]
Your California privacy rights.
If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:
Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you and the categories of sources of such information;
Inform you about the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” personal information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell” or with whom we “share” personal information, and the categories of personal information we “sell” or “share”;
Provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we collect about you;
Correct inaccurate personal information we have about you; and
Delete personal information we have about you.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you. You may only make such a request twice within a twelve-month period. Requests are generally free; however, we may charge a reasonable fee or deny your request if it is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.
To make a CCPA request, please email us at
privacy@pinatafarm.com
. We will request information, which at a minimum will include your name and email address, to verify your identity. We may request additional information to verify your identity before responding to a request. Under the CCPA, you may have an authorized agent submit a request on your behalf, and we will collect certain authorization and verification information from the agent and you in such circumstances.
The CCPA provides you with the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights under applicable law (as set forth in California law). The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your “sensitive personal information” is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose “sensitive personal information” other than for purposes for which you cannot exercise the right to limit under the CCPA.
Shine the Light Disclosure.
The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we disclose certain categories of “personal information” (as defined in the Shine the Light law) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS
Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of "personally identifiable information" for monetary consideration (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting us at
privacy@pinatafarm.com
. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

Future of Privacy Forum
launched this website in 2013 to provide information on how web browsers can express a user’s preference for tracking using Do Not Track (DNT).
DNT is a technical specification designed to help users express their preferences about online tracking. It is a set of rules that help your web browser tell websites if you don’t want your online activities to be tracked, including a simple way for users to set this preference and for websites to communicate back about whether they will respect your choice. The
specific rules
were developed in the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
, an organization dedicated to creating a universal standard that streamlines web protocols and practices. However, the efforts led by the W3C did not result in a W3C Recommendation. As a result of the lack of consensus on how companies should operationalize the DNT preference, most sites do not respond to DNT as a consumer’s choice not to be tracked.
Legislative developments in California and other states have replaced aspects of DNT, leading to the development of the
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
, an opt-out signal to websites, informing them that the user does not want their personal information sold as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Similarly, the California Data Deletion Act (
SB362
) allows California residents to have their personal information deleted by all registered data brokers in the state. Meanwhile, California’s Do Not Track Law (
AB370
) still requires most commercial websites to disclose whether and how they respect Do Not Track signals.
