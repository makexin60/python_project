Privacy Policy
The LuckGrib privacy policy is pretty simple.
Personal information
The only personal information that may be retained by LuckGrib is if you
email the author with a suggestion, question or for any other reason, your
email may be preserved.  LuckGrib does not sell, rent or lease the list of
email addresses of customers who are kind enough to contact us.  That would
be rude and we donâ€™t do it.
Non personal information
There is some non-personal information retained in the LuckGrib server cluster.
Each instance of LuckGrib is assigned a universally unique identifier 
(
UUID
.)
This UUID does not encapsulate any information about you, the device it
was generated on, or anything else that may identify you - it is essentially 
a randomly generated string.
Each request to the server cluser passes along the UUID assigned to that
particular instance of the app and this information is used in order that
the cluster can generate statistics about how it is being used.
Automatically collected information
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically
collected by the server cluster.  This information can include: your IP
address, browser type, domain names, access times.  This information is used
for the operation of the service and to provide general statistics
regarding use of the server cluster.  This information is transient.
Cookies
This website does not use cookies to track your activity.
