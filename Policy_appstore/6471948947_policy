For example, we ditched an entire feature of SwiftUI called ‚Äùswipe gestures‚Äù just to implement our own custom design with tiny little bubbles ü´ß. This was not just about adding a cool feature, but about making the experience feel uniquely ours. We believe that innovation is not about following the trends, but about creating them.
We wanted to make Rooms adapt to the way you want, so we made it possible to edit almost everything in the app, from the subscriptions list to the settings screen. You can change everything to fit your style, and make the app yours. It‚Äôs about your preferences, your experience, and your customization.
We didn‚Äôt want to make theme editing difficult or technical. Instead, we created a system that was simply easy to use. No coding required, just select, drag, and drop. The app adapts to your choices.
Do things like this and more with the app. From full customization of the app‚Äôs interface to adding your personal touch to every button, you have the power to control your experience completely.
Whether you're a casual user or a tech-savvy enthusiast, Rooms allows you to personalize each aspect to suit your needs, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience every time you use it.
So go ahead, unleash your creativity and make Rooms your own!
