Privacy and online safety are important to Logitbox. We offer a software platform and services for helping keep a logbook of professional activity. We collect data about users (“Data”) when they use the platform, the services, and our websites (collectively, “Services”). This privacy policy describes how we collect, use and disclose Data.
In this privacy policy, we sometimes refer to “You”. “You” may be a visitor to one of our websites, or a user of one or more of our Services (“User”). We’ll do our best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy. This policy does not apply to third-party websites, products, or services even if they link to our Services, and You should consider the privacy practices of those third-parties carefully.
If You disagree with the practices described in this policy, You should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from Your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue Your use of our Services. Finally, we have also put together a Cookie Policy that describes in detail how we use cookies and similar technologies.
1. Overview
The Data we collect depends on how our Services are used. Sometimes we receive Data directly, such as when a Logitbox account is created, or we receive an email. Other times,we get Data by recording interactions with our Services by, for example, using technologies like cookies and web beacons. We also get Data from third parties, like our payment processing partners or identity verification services.
The collection and use of data from a variety of sources is essential to our ability to provide our Services – and to help keep the Services safe. Data is critical in helping us to increase the safety of Your online logbooks, and reduce the risk of unauthorised access and leak of data (yours and other users’) held on our Services.

We also receive Personal Data from other sources, such as our financial service providers, identity verification services, and publicly available sources.
