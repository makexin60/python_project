What information will Celo collect about me?
While visiting this website or our social media pages, Celo may collect personal information about you when you order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected may include your name, your company name, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, contact and billing information, depending on what you provide us. Celo also uses cookies and collects IP addresses (a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet) and other information about your computer or device. Please see our Cookies Policy for more information.
What will Celo use my personal information for?
Celo may use your personal information for its legitimate business interests, including the following activities:
Responding to your requests
- We may use your contact details to provide you with information about our products and services in response to your requests made via the website.
Sales and Marketing
- We may use your personal information to contact you to see whether you are interested in our products and services, or to send you general information about our products and service, newsletters, invitations to events or updates on Celo and our customers, i.e. customer case studies.
- You can opt-out of direct marketing emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link in the email, or writing to
support@celohealth.com
and we will help you.
- We may use your information together with other people’s information in anonymized and aggregated form (so that it is not identifiable to you) for marketing and strategic development purposes, and may disclose it to third parties for this purpose. We do not sell or trade your information.
Website and Social Media Management and Improvement
We use cookies and third party analytics services such as Google Analytics on our website and social media pages to:
- remember your settings during and between visits (for example, your region)
- see what you are doing on the website and how often you visit
- allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook
- block any disruptive use
- perform data analysis and research to improve our website and services
The use of cookies on our website and how you can reject cookies is explained in our Cookies Policy.
Will Celo share my information with anyone else?
Generally, Celo will not share your personal information outside our organisation. Your information may be processed by third party suppliers we use, for example digital marketing and analytics service providers and cloud-based application providers like Microsoft.
Will my personal information leave the country?
Any personal information you provide to us will be held in third party servers located as specified in our Celo Cloud Policy. You can read this policy here:
https://www.celohealth.com/legal
Your personal information will be accessed by staff located at our offices in the US, UK, Australia or New Zealand for the purposes described in this policy. Celo insures that there are adequate privacy and security arrangements in place wherever your information is accessed by way of strict privacy and security obligations in inter-company agreements and in our agreements with third parties.
How we protect your information
Celo actively seeks to maintain the privacy of our online visitors, and we have constructed and administer this website accordingly. To prevent unauthorized use, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
How long will Celo keep my information?
We will only hold your personal information in our systems for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose you submitted it for.
Your Rights
You have rights under applicable laws to access personal information the company holds about you, and have it corrected where necessary, subject to some exceptions. Depending on the country you reside in, you may also have rights to access your personal information in a portable, electronic format, a right to have your personal information erased, a right to know the third parties with whom your personal information has been shared with and/or a right to object to Celo processing your personal information. You also have rights, under applicable laws, to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection or privacy authorities if you believe Celo is not handling your personal information in accordance with the law, and you may have rights to compensation in this case. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email Celo at
support@celohealth.com
.
What if I am under 18?
If you are aged 18 or under, please get your parent/guardian’s permission before you provide any personal information to Celo. Celo does not knowingly solicit, collect, or accept any information from or about children via this website. If we become aware that a person submitting personal information through any part of our website is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.
Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete any information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and deleted the information, then we will of course honour that request.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to submit personal information to Celo.

Introduction
The Celo website uses cookies to help provide you with the best user experience possible. This Cookie Policy applies to Celo’s use of cookies on this website, and forms part of Celo’s Privacy Policy. If you want to stop cookies being stored by your computer, you can change your browser settings. If you continue to use this website without changing your settings we assume you consent to the way we use cookies described in this Cookie Policy. If you have any questions about this Cookie Policy you can contact us at

What is a cookie?
A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in your web browser while you are browsing that website. When you browse the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to show your previous activity, including when you have logged in to the website before and which pages you have visited.
How Celo uses cookies
Celo uses cookies to store small bits of information on your computer and then retrieve them when you revisit. The information we collect includes your IP address, but not any other information about you such as your name, address, telephone number or email address unless you provide it to us.
These cookies help us to:
Remember your settings during and between visits (your region, for example)
- Improve the speed and security of the website
- Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook
- Continuously improve our website for you
- Make our marketing more efficient
The following types of cookies are in use while browsing the Celo website:
- Strictly necessary cookies
- Performance cookies
- Functionality cookies
- Targeting / Advertising cookies
These cookies are a mixture of first party cookies, which we set ourselves, and third party cookies, which are set by other websites. Below is a list of the different types of cookies used on this website, and an explanation of what they are used for.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to function. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the website will then not work.
Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our website. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our website, and will not be able to monitor its performance. There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our website.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization such as remembering which region you selected on your last visit. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages to improve performance or functionality such as social media sharing. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Targeting/Advertising Cookies
Cookies are widely used in online advertising. We use Google Analytics, which includes advertising features allowing us to show you ads based on Google’s profile of you, show re-marketing ads based on your viewing behavior on our website, as well as receive reporting on how many times these ads have been shown. We may use these features to show special offers to you, or suggest other relevant content to encourage you to come back to our website. Don’t worry, we are unable to proactively reach out to you directly (as the whole process is anonymized) by email or other means unless you provide us with your contact details.
Cookies in emails
Any emails you receive from us may include cookies, but these will only be activated if you click on the links in the email. We use this functionality to track which links were clicked and in what quantity, as well as the aggregate number of links clicked.
