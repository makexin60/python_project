					features, services, and communications provided by The Seattle Times (“Sites”), however accessed
					and/or used, that are operated by us, made available by us, or produced and maintained by Seattle
					Times Company (collectively “The Seattle Times” or “we”, “us”, or “our”). We have established this
					privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather

						Policy retroactively or to personal information already in our possession, we will provide you
						with notice of the modifications or amendments.

					by Seattle Times Company, 1000 Denny Way, Seattle, WA 98109.
What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?
We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites,
					personal information and non-personal information. Personal information is information that you may
					supply to us, as described more fully below, i.e., when you subscribe, place an order, complete a
					survey, register for a Site or any part thereof, enter a contest, upload content, participate in a
					community, or provide your e-mail address. Personal information is any information that can
					individually identify you and includes, among other things, your name, e-mail address, telephone
					number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information. Non-personal information
					includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may include tracking and usage
					information about your location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet.
Personal Information
As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personal information to
							us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your
							personal information. The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your
							personal information.

Collection of Personal Information From or Through Social Media Sites
When you interact with any The Seattle Times property page or account on a social media
							platform, such as Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), Google+, Tumblr,
							LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personal information that you make
							available to us on that page or account including your account ID or “handle.” However, we
							will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will
							only collect and store such personal information that we are permitted to collect by these
							social media platforms. If you choose to link or login to your The Seattle Times account
							with or through a social networking service, The Seattle Times and that service may disclose
							certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may disclose
							information about your activities, including what you view on the Sites, with that social
							network's users.
Non-Personal Information
In addition, when you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does
							not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your
							use of our Sites (“Non-Personal Information”). Generally, we collect and store the following
							categories of Non-Personal Information:
Demographic data such as age, gender, and five digit zip code as part of collecting
								personal information
Neighborhood information
Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to
								access the Sites. This information may include IP address, geolocation information,
								unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional
								information.
Usage information about your use of the Sites. This information includes a reading
								history of the pages you view. We use this information to provide you a more customized
								experience on the Sites.
Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash
								reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.
Your search terms and search results.
Other information regarding your use of the Sites.
Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information
We collect and store your device's source IP address which may disclose the location of your
							device at the time you access the Sites. Advertisements and certain content may be directed
							to you as a result of this data.
In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if
							you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be
							stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content
							tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your
							history, we will store such information on our servers.
Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information From Other Sources
We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources
							(including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us
							to update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your
							experience on the Sites.

Cookie List
A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Targeting Cookies
These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Social Media Cookies
These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.

Is Personal Information Collected From Children?
Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and with parent or guardian consent (for instance, in
					some of the educational areas on our Sites), The Seattle Times does not knowingly collect personal
					identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you
					should not provide personally identifiable information to The Seattle Times without providing us
					with consent from your parents. If The Seattle Times discovers that a child under the age of 13 has
					provided The Seattle Times with personally identifiable information and we do not have parental
					consent, The Seattle Times will immediately delete that child's information from the Sites.

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your Personal
					Information collected online to any companies not part of the Seattle Times Company or its
					subsidiaries or related entities. Although, as disclosed below, we may provide your information to
					our partners, in no event will we sell or rent your Personal Information as part of a customer list
					or similar transaction.
Third-Party Agents
We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on
							our behalf, such as hosting, billing, content syndication, content management tools, social
							media integration, marketing, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc. These
							entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are
							contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal
							Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in
							any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites.
Business Partners and Third Parties
We may disclose your Personal Information with our business partners or co-marketers from
							time to time. We may also disclose your Personal Information with third parties that provide
							products and services that we think you may be interested in. Although our treatment of your
							Personal Information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the business partner or third
							party's treatment of your Personal Information will be governed by the business partner or
							third party's privacy policy. You may withdraw your consent to our sharing of your Personal
							Information with business partners and third parties at any time by following the opt-out
							process described below.

We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the
							good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply
							with legal process served on us or the Sites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property,

							we will disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties to help us determine how people
							use parts of the Sites and who our users are so we can improve our Sites. We will also
							disclose Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties about how our
							users collectively use the Sites.
What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?
We are concerned about ensuring the security of your Personal Information. We exercise great care in
					providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers. Personal
					Information collected by our Sites are stored in secure operating environments that are not
					available to the public. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
					identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. Please understand, however, that while
					we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data
					over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure
You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your
					business as prompted by a Website's registration form (such information being the "Registration
					Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current
					and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
					or The Seattle Times has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate,
					not current or incomplete, The Seattle Times has the right to suspend or terminate your account and
					refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof). You are entirely
					responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are
					entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.
What Happens When I Link To or From Another Website?
These Sites may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of The Seattle Times or third
					parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for Seattle Times do
					not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the
					actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites.
What About Contests, Sweepstakes or Games?
When we run a contest or sweepstakes or game relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set
					of rules. The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered
					from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this Privacy
					Policy. In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be
					collected only if you voluntarily submit it to.
Public Areas, Chat Rooms, Reviews, and Community Areas
Please remember that any information you disclose in public areas, such as message boards or feedback
					sections, becomes public and anyone may take and use that information. Please be careful about what
					you disclose and do not post any Personal Information that you expect to keep private. Please
					consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other community areas for
					more information.
Governing Law
These Sites are published in the United States. We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all
					users of our Sites and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to
					the extent they may apply to the The Seattle Times services, but our family of Sites are located and
					targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws. If
					you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where
					you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to The Seattle Times.
Assignment
We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services. We may
					also sell certain assets associated with the Sites. As a result, please be aware that in such event
					we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or
					to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent
					possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as
					it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or
					the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as
					described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to This Policy
As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites. In the event
					that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately. We will
					post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might
					use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We do, however, recommend that you
					read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the
					Privacy Policy. We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less
					protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express
					consent.
How Do I Opt-Out or Correct Information About Me
You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from The Seattle Times. We
					provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us by going into your
					profile settings and choosing the appropriate options. To opt-out, you can also send us a message at
webmaster@seattletimes.com
.

					us at
webmaster@seattletimes.com
contact us at
206.624.7323
or send us a letter to P.O. Box 70. Seattle, WA 98111.
					Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and
					include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are not required
					to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address, phone number or
					mail address.
California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive
					certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about them, as well
					as rights to know/access, correct, delete, and limit disclosure of personal information. You have
					the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. To the extent
					that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices,
					and your rights are described below.
Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected
You have the right to receive notice of certain information about our data collection, use, and
					disclosure. The following table summarizes the categories of personal information we collect; the
					categories of sources of that information; whether we disclose, sell, or share that information to
					service providers or third parties, respectively; and the criteria we use to determine the retention
					period for such information. The categories we use to describe personal information are those
					enumerated in the CCPA. We collect this personal information for the purposes described above in
					“How Do We Use Your Information.”

We determine the retention period for each of the categories of personal information listed above
					based on (1) the length of time we need to retain the information to achieve the business or
					commercial purpose for which it was obtained, (2) any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to
					such information, (3) internal operational needs, and (4) any need for the information based on any
					actual or anticipated investigation or litigation.
Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service providers, which are
					companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. We restrict service providers from
					using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement.
Entities to whom we “sell” or with whom we “share” information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a
					business “sells” personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for
					monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because we disclose
					personal information to the company for something other than an enumerated business purpose under
					California law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal information for
					purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us. A business “shares” personal information when
					it discloses personal information to a company for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
Your Rights Under the CCPA
Opt out of sale or sharing of personal information
: You have the right to opt out of our
					sale or sharing of your personal information to third parties. To exercise this right, please visit
					our
Do Not Sell My Personal Information

					personal information to
					service providers.
Know and request access to and correction or deletion of personal information
: You have the
					right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the
					source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and
					service providers to whom we sell, share, or disclose it. You also have the right to request in
					certain circumstances that we correct personal information that we have collected about you and to
					delete personal information that we have collected directly from you. Please
contact us
to exercise these rights.

Individuals Located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland:
If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, the following information applies.
Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing: As explained above, we process personal
						information in various ways depending upon your use of our Sites. We process personal
						information on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our
						agreement to provide Sites; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the
						Sites where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms related to data
						privacy.
Right to lodge a complaint: Users that reside in the EEA or Switzerland have the right to lodge
						a complaint about our data collection and processing actions with the supervisory authority
						concerned. Contact details for data protection authorities are available
here
.
Transfers: Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in,
						the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or subcontractors maintain
						facilities. We ensure that transfers of personal information to a third country or an
						international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of
						the GDPR.
Your Options to Control Your Personal Information
Verification Procedures
: We must verify your identity for everyone's protection, so we may
					require you to provide us with verification information prior to accessing any records containing
					personal information about you. We do this by:
Asking you to provide personal identifiers we can match against information we may have
						collected from you previously and confirm your request using the email or telephone account
						stated in the request.
If you are a California resident, you may authorize another individual or a business registered with
					the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. We
					will require the authorized agent and you to each verify your identities.
We will use the information you provide for verification only for the purpose of verification. We may
					have a reason under the law why we do not have to respond to your request, or respond to it in a
					more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
Marketing and Other Communications
: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from
					receiving future emails, you can click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email
					communication, or
contact us
using the contact information below and we will
					promptly remove you
					from all marketing correspondence.
Interest-Based Advertising; Cookie Management; and Do Not Track
: Interest-based advertising
					is the collection of information across different websites and/or different devices for the purpose
					of tailoring advertising based on preferences or interests known or inferred from the information
					collected.
The Seattle Times serves advertising on the Sites and we partner with third parties to use the
					information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites to provide you with
					advertising that is more relevant to you after you leave our Sites. You may limit such third
					parties' information collection by using our cookie management control panel. You can learn more
					about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your
					information by visiting the websites for the
Network
						Advertising Initiative
, the
Digital
						Advertising Alliance
, and
					the
European Interactive Digital
						Advertising Initiative
. Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app
					tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the
					advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.
Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive
					advertising while using our Sites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of
					interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will,
					however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as
					provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete
					your opt-out preferences.

When Marfeel acts as a Data Processor, it processes your personal data on behalf of the Publisher of the website you have visited (the Data Controller / s) on the basis of their instructions. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the PusPublisher to establish an adequate lawful ground for the processing of your data, which must be determined in their own Privacy Policies.
Accordingly, we strongly recommend that you check the Publisher’s website policy for details on the treatment of your personal information.

Your personal data will only be stored in a way that allows your identification for a period not exceeding the necessary for the purposes for which they were collected, in accordance with the instructions given by the Publisher.
At the end of the contractual relationship with the Publisher or when they request it, we will make reasonable efforts to return or irretrievably erase all personal data processed on behalf of our Publisher.

4. To whom do we transfer your personal information?
In general, MARFEEL will not transfer your data to third parties. However, in addition to the assignments that we specifically indicate in the section in which we explain the characteristics of the different activities (point 3), we inform you of the communications that we can make, in general, and that affect all the previous treatments and its legitimizing base.
1. MARFEEL group of companies:
Personal data may be shared with the rest of the Marfeel group of companies (specifically: MARFEEL COLOMBIA, SAS - Colombia-) for the purposes of management and technical support of the group. Some of the group’s companies are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which is why international transfers of your data take place. In this sense, Marfeel has implemented the appropriate procedures and mechanisms to be able to carry out such transfers, as explained in the following section.
2. Providers of essential services
to execute the service we offer you, (for example, computer hosting companies or platforms to send commercial communications). Notwithstanding the foregoing, these entities have signed the corresponding confidentiality agreements and will only process your data according to our instructions, not being able to use them for their own purposes or apart from the service they provide us.
3. Public organisms.
We may disclose to the competent public authorities the data and any other information that is in our possession or that is accessible through our systems when there is a legal obligation to do so, as well as when it is required, for example, when the purpose is that of prevent or prosecute abuse of services or fraudulent activities through our Website or web page. In these cases, the personal data that you provide us would be kept and made available to the administrative or judicial authorities.
4. In the event of a corporate transaction:
In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of all or part of its assets or any other type of corporate transaction involving a third party, we may share, disclose or transfer user data to the successor entity (including during the pre-transaction phase).
5. To third parties after aggregation or anonymization:
we may disclose or use aggregated or anonymized data (that is, which is not linked to an identified or identifiable natural person) for any purpose.
6. To third parties with the consent of the user or another legitimate basis:
In the event that we want to share data with third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy, data subject consent will be requested, in any case, or they will be informed about it and its legitimate basis.
Likewise, we inform you that this Privacy Policy only refers to the collection, processing and use of information (related to personal data) by us through the interaction you make with our Website. Access to third-party Web pages that you can access through links from the Web Site have their own privacy policies over which we have no control. Therefore, before providing them with any personal information, we recommend that you inform yourself about their Privacy Policies.
5. Is your personal data transferred to third countries outside the economic area?
As indicated in the previous section, some of the Marfeel group companies are located in countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”):
MARFEEL COLOMBIA SAS– Colombia-
In addition, some of our service providers may also be located outside the EEA.
The location of these companies outside the EEA implies the existence of an international transfer of your personal data, which could entail a lower degree of protection than that contained in European regulations. However, at MARFEEL we have applied measures so that said transfers do not give rise to a lower degree of protection of your personal data.
In this sense, all have signed the corresponding standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (“SCC”), an agreement signed between both entities by which the non-EU company guarantees that it applies European data protection standards.
Therefore, the use of these providers does not give rise to a lower degree of protection of your personal data than the use of providers located in the European Union. You can check the content of the SCC in the following link:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contractstransfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
