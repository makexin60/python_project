The public interest is required to be laid down in Union law or Member State law or other applicable law to which we are subject. In this case, we rely on Articles 168 and 179 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

META QUEST
Parent Privacy Disclosure
Effective from 4 November 2024
Please read this Parent Privacy Disclosure carefully. It applies to Meta accounts that parents create for children aged 10 to 12 years old (or the applicable age in your region) for use on
Meta VR Products
.
This Parent Privacy Disclosure ("Privacy Disclosure") summarises how Meta collects, uses and discloses your child's personal information after you've created your child's Meta account. As the parent or legal guardian, please review this Privacy Disclosure and the collection, use and disclosure of your child's information as described below to set up a Meta account for your child.
This Privacy Disclosure does not apply to the practices of any third-party services (including apps or games) that may be accessed through a Meta Quest device. Before using any third-party service, you should review the applicable terms and policies to determine their appropriateness for your child, including the service's data collection and use practices.
To learn more about how Meta handles your and your child's personal information, please review the
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy
. Please also help your child to review the
Privacy Guide for Children
.
Controls for parents
As the parent or legal guardian, you will manage this Meta account until your child has turned 13 or 14, depending on where they live. This means that you will be able to take the following actions with regard to your child's personal information:
Change your child's default account settings at any time in
Family Centre
, including reviewing or editing your child's Meta account information, such as the password used to log in to their device and changing the settings that govern your child's Active Status, which allows their followers to see whether they are online or were recently online.
Irrespective of these default privacy settings, users who are currently in the same app or experience may be able to see your child's presence in that app or experience, and Meta Quest users can still search for your child's name or username and send your child a follow request.
Add users as approved contacts that your child can call and chat with. These users will be able to send or receive invitations from your child to join them in an app or experience. You can remove approved contacts at any time in
Family Centre
. Your child can remove approved contacts at any time in the Meta Horizon mobile app and in virtual reality.
View your child's followers and following lists, and block users. You can choose to manage your child's follower and following lists, to approve your child's follower and following requests.
Approve your child's app downloads and purchases and manage which Horizon worlds they access, create and collaborate on.
Set time limits, such as a daily time limit and breaks when your child cannot use Meta Horizon or Horizon Worlds.
Access, download and delete information collected about or from your child and delete your child's Meta account. Your child can also exercise the same privacy rights, including deleting their Meta account.
When your child has turned 13 or 14 (depending on where they live), they will have 30 days to start managing their Meta account or they will be blocked from using their device. Once they've started managing their own Meta account, they will need to review the
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy
. Your child will also be automatically defaulted into parental supervision, but you or your child can opt out in
Family Centre
.
Information that we collect about your child
As part of creating a Meta account, we ask for your child's name, email address, password and date of birth. Additionally, your child must create a
Meta Horizon profile
, which includes their name, username, avatar, list of followers and profile picture.
When your child uses Meta VR Products, Meta may also collect the following information:
Information about your child's connections to other users, such as whom your child follows, whom you have added as an approved contact for your child and when the same parent or guardian manages your child's account
Information about your child's activity in Meta Quest devices and apps, including the apps that they download and the time, frequency and duration of their activities
Information about your child's gameplay activity and statistics, including actions in a game and associated metadata
Information about content that your child creates, such as a picture or an object that your child builds. We also collect information about this content, such as the date and time that your child created it.
Video and audio information recorded when cameras and microphones are enabled on Meta VR Products
Headset location via Wi-Fi and IP signals to determine general location when location services are on
With your approval, additional information about how your child uses their Meta Quest device to improve Meta Quest products for everyone and/or further tailor your child's experiences in virtual reality, so they'll see more of what's relevant to them
With your approval, information about the size of walls, surfaces and objects in your child's room and the distances between them and your child's headset to offer experiences that blend their virtual and real-world environments
Personal information necessary to provide services so that the device and any features that you or your child turn on function optimally
Physical information about or related to your child, such as estimated hand size and body scale, and hand and pose data, if you choose to enable the hand and body tracking feature
Information about or related to the position and orientation of the headset, controllers and body movements to determine body pose, make your child's avatar's movements more realistic and deliver an immersive virtual experience
Information about or related to your child's fitness activities in virtual reality if you choose to enable fitness-related experiences, such as Move
Information collected in or through various technologies on the Meta Quest website, browser and Meta Horizon mobile app, including cookies, pixels, local storage and similar technologies, as described in the sections about essential cookies in the
Meta Cookies Policy
.
Technical information about the devices that your child uses and how they use them, including performance and device attributes, system logs and settings, success or failure of specific functions, use of third-party services and crash reports.
We also receive information from developers about your child's activity in their apps, including your child's achievements and what features they use. Additionally, we receive information about your child's age category (not including date of birth) from partners and third parties, including some developers.
Additionally, when your child uses Horizon Worlds, the last few minutes of your child's and other users' most recent audio, video and other interactions in Horizon Worlds are recorded in case your child wants to report anything that they've encountered. These recordings may be stored on our servers. We do not review these recordings unless your child submits a report. If your child doesn't submit a report, the recordings will be deleted on a rolling basis. These recordings enable your child to report abuse, combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community. Other users in close proximity to your child in Horizon Worlds may submit recordings of the same event. If your child submits a report, we use the attached recordings to investigate and fully resolve the report, and to help train our systems to better combat harmful behaviour, after which time, the recordings will be deleted. In some cases, we may need to retain the recordings for longer, where it is necessary in order to comply with applicable law.
How we use your child's information
We use your child's information to communicate with them, provide services such as Meta accounts, undertake analytics and measurement, promote safety, security, integrity and optimal operation on Meta VR Products and to conduct research and innovate for social good.
We use information, such as age, chosen language, general location and people that your child is connected with, so that we can provide your child with additional product functionalities and safe, age-appropriate experiences, such as enabling them to invite people to specific apps and worlds and placing them in apps and worlds with people that they know, contacts that you have approved and/or others their age for gameplay.
Users that you add as approved contacts, your child's followers and those that they follow may appear higher in your child's search results.
We also offer optional personalisation to help your child find relevant experiences, for example, to recommend apps based on their interests or worlds that they or people that they know have visited.
We use device performance and reliability data to improve and develop Meta VR Products.
How we share your child's information
We share your child's information with various categories of third parties in connection with your child's use of Meta VR Products:
Information that is Public:
Your child's Meta Horizon Profile information, including their display name, username, profile picture and avatar will be
public
and visible to other users on or off Meta Quest products.
Information shared while playing online:
When your child uses a multi-user app on their Meta Quest device, their activity and other information that they provide, including their avatar, in-app profile information and in-app activity are visible to all within the app, irrespective of the privacy settings that you've selected for your child.
Information shared with third-party developers:
We share your child's Meta Horizon profile information with apps that they use so that they can appear as their Meta Horizon profile in those apps. We may also share information about your child's age category (not including date of birth), followers, blocked users, subscriptions, personal identifiers, app invitations (when social features are enabled) and in-app purchases and destinations with app developers.
Information shared with other users:
We may share certain information about your child, including the fact that they have a parent-managed Meta account and the apps that they have, with other users who are managed or supervised by the same parent or guardian. Your child's activity, such as apps that your child has used and achievements in those apps, will be visible to their followers.
Vendors and service providers:
We share your child's information with vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
Third parties for security, integrity and legal requests:
Meta may share your child's information in response to valid law enforcement requests for information, including emergency requests related to credible threats of violence or harm, as well as other legal requests.
Data retention
We keep information as long as we need it to provide Meta Quest Products, comply with legal obligations, respond to a legal request, protect our or other's interests, prevent harm or to improve safety, integrity and security features. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on many factors, such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and relevant legal, integrity or operational retention needs.

Meta Horizon Privacy Guide for Children
18 likes
Updated:
a week ago
As of 31 March 2025, Move will be discontinued and no longer available in Meta Horizon OS and the Meta Horizon mobile app.
Your privacy on Meta Horizon
This privacy guide is for children between 10 and 12 years old (these ages may differ by region). If you're a teen, an adult or a parent/guardian, take a look at our
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy
and
Parental Privacy Disclosure
to learn more.
We've written this privacy guide to help you understand what types of personal information Meta collects and how it is used to give you the best experience in mixed reality (MR).
If you need help with understanding anything in this privacy guide, please talk to your parent, guardian or the adult who looks after you.
How do I set up my Meta account and how does it work?
Your parent or guardian must create and manage your Meta account for you. They have this ability so that they can help you have a safer and age-appropriate experience in MR. Your parent can:
See, change or download information, such as your name, date of birth, email address or account password, and delete your Meta account.
Approve your app downloads and purchases, buy tokens for you to purchase digital goods and manage which Horizon worlds you can access, create and collaborate on.
See how much time you are spending in MR and choose how long and when you can use your device and apps.
See who you are following and being followed by, block people and see anyone that you have reported to Meta. They can also choose to approve your follower and following requests.
Add people as "approved contacts" that you can call and chat with (but you can remove these contacts at any time). These users will also be able to send or receive travel invitations from you to join you in an app or experience.
See and change your activity settings, such as showing others whether you are online or not, what apps you are using in MR and which Horizon world you are in.
When you've turned 13 (or 14, depending on where you live), you'll start managing your account by yourself. Learn more about what this means
here
. We'll send you more information before then so that you know what to do.
What information does Meta have about me and where do they get this from?
Information that you and your parent/guardian give us
. This includes the information given when you set up an account, such as your name, date of birth, username and password. Your parent/guardian can also choose to give us more information about you, such as the apps that you use or settings that you choose, to help improve your overall experience in MR.
Location information that we collect from your device
. This helps us to understand your general location, but we do not know information such as your address.
Information as you use your device.
Physical movements.
For example, the position of your headset or body movements. If your parent/guardian allows you to use the hand and body tracking feature, we also know information such as your estimated hand size and hand and body pose.
Fitness information.
If your parent/guardian allows you to use Meta Quest Move, we will also know information about your fitness activities.
Your activity in Meta Quest devices and apps
. For example, the apps you download, the time, frequency and duration of your activities, and your actions in a game.
Environmental information and dimensions.
For example, information about your surroundings such as the size of walls, surfaces and objects in your room and the distances between them and your headset for experiences that blend your virtual and real-world environments.
Learn more
.
Video and audio information
. We get this information when your cameras and microphones are turned on.
Your content
. Such as the objects that you build and information, such as the date and time that you created the content.
Recordings
. Additionally, when you use Horizon Worlds, the last few minutes of your most recent audio, video and other interactions are recorded in case you want to report anything. Other users may also submit recordings of the same event. We do not review these recordings unless you submit a report and the recordings are deleted on a rolling basis. These recordings are for your safety.
Information about you and other users.
Such as who you follow, your approved contacts and if you are managed or supervised by the same parent/guardian as another user.
Information that others give us.
For example, app developers may tell us if they know that you are under or over 13. They might also tell us about your achievements and what features you use in the apps. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other companies with your parent/guardian to learn how they handle any information that you choose to share if you use their apps.
How and why does Meta use my information?
We use your information for things such as:
Providing and improving our services.
Promoting safety and security
. This helps us to give you an age-appropriate experience in MR. Additionally, if you submit a report, we use recordings to investigate and resolve the report, and to help train our systems to better combat harmful behaviour.
Showing you things that we think you might like
. We use information, such as your age, chosen language, general location and people that you are connected with to provide you with additional product functionalities and safe and age-appropriate experiences, so that you can invite people and be placed in apps and worlds with people that you know, people your parent/guardian have approved and/or others your age for gameplay. Your parent/guardian can choose to give us more information, such as the apps that you download and use or the Horizon worlds that your approved contacts have visited, to further personalise your experiences in MR and help you find more age-appropriate and relevant experiences. Your followers, approved contacts and people that you follow might also appear higher in your search results.
Communicating with you
. For example, we may send you information to let you know about changes to your account.
Will anyone else see my information?
We share some of your information:
With your parent/guardian.
With other users. Your Meta Horizon profile information (such as your display name, username, profile picture and avatar) can always be seen by others. When your parent/guardian allows you to download and use a multi-player app, other users can also see your activity and your Meta Horizon profile information and can send you follow requests.
Your followers will be able to see your activity, such as the apps that you use and your achievements.
Other people who are managed or supervised by the same parent/guardian will be able to see the fact you have a parent-managed account and the apps you have.
With other companies that we work with, such as app developers, but only if your parent/guardian has given you access to their app and they need the information to provide it.
When we need to for legal reasons.
What are my rights?
You can ask us at any time if you want to see, change, delete or stop us from using your information. You can also tell us if you are concerned about anything that we are doing with your information or if you want to make a complaint.
If you need any help with these things, you can always chat to your parent/guardian and you can find more information on our
Privacy Centre
.
Where can I find out more information?
For more details, please ask your parent/guardian to help you read our
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy
and
Parental Privacy Disclosure
. You can also take a look at our Help Centre to learn more about your privacy and Meta account.

META QUEST
Hand and Body Privacy Notice
Effective from 1 November 2023
What is hand and body tracking
Hand and body tracking is a feature for Meta Quest devices that allows you to switch between hands and controllers to interact with your surroundings and have a more seamless or immersive experience, such as by navigating virtual menus or selecting applications and websites on Meta Quest devices with your hands, or having an obstructing hand removed from a scene. Hand and body tracking also helps make your avatar's movements look more realistic. You have the choice to turn hand and body tracking on and off in Settings.
How hand and body tracking works
When hand and body tracking is enabled, our software analyses images of your hands and body from the cameras on your headset to estimate the location of certain key points on your hands and body (such as your knuckles, arms, legs and torso). All of this analysis is done on your device in real time as you move, and the images and estimated points are deleted in real time after processing. We do not collect or store this data on Meta servers.
The software fits a generic hand and body model over the estimated points on your hands and body, resulting in estimated body scale data (which estimates the proportion of certain parts of your body to the generic body model), estimated hand size (represented by standardised numerical values such as between 0.5 and 1.5), and estimated hand and body pose data (such as approximate position and orientation of fingers and body parts).
Estimated body scale and estimated hand and body pose data are processed on your device or Meta servers (e.g. the data may be processed on Meta servers to animate your avatar's movements in a multiplayer scenario), and are continuously generated and overwritten in real time as they provide this feature.
Estimated hand size data is also processed on device or on Meta servers. It is generated every time you put on your headset and start using hand and body tracking. We store estimated hand size data on our servers to ensure that hand and body tracking works properly; this data will be deleted within 90 days, when no longer needed for that purpose. Estimated hand size data may be stored on your device to provide you with a more consistent experience across play sessions. If estimated hand size data has been stored on your device, the device will be programmed to delete the data within three years, or if you choose to turn off storage, whichever occurs first. Unless storage is on, estimated hand size data will be deleted from your device at the end of each play session.
As estimated body scale, estimated hand size, and estimated hand and body pose data (collectively, "abstracted hand and body data") is based on generic models and standardised numerical values, it is not unique to you. For example, your estimated hand size might be "1" and many other people would have that same estimated hand size.
On Meta Quest Pro, Meta Quest 2 and earlier devices, our software will only process a subset of this hand and body tracking data (i.e. only data about your hands) due to system limitations.
If another person uses your account on your Meta Quest devices when you have enabled hand and body tracking, the raw hand and body images, estimated points on hands and body, and abstracted hand and body data from such person may also be processed unless they turn off the feature. You can only permit other people to use the feature through your account if they have enabled it through their accounts or if you are their legally authorised representative.
How to enable and disable hand and body tracking
To enable this feature, navigate to the
Settings
tab in VR, select
Movement tracking
and toggle on the
Hand and body tracking
feature to enable it. You can disable hand and body tracking at any time by toggling the feature off in Settings.
If you choose to disable hand and body tracking, you can use controllers to interact with your surroundings on Meta Quest devices and your avatar's movements will be based on the position and orientation of your headset and controllers. See our
Privacy Policy
for more information.
What data is collected
We collect and retain certain data from your device to provide the hand and body tracking feature and ensure that it works properly, consistent with our
Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy
:
As explained above, we store estimated hand size data on our servers and delete it within 90 days.
We also collect and retain your usage data, image telemetry (e.g. exposure, contrast) and other information about your interactions with hand and body tracking, such as tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and body, and the number of gestures that you make. If you have chosen to share additional data with Meta, we collect additional data about how you use your headset (including hand and body tracking) to help Meta better personalise your experiences and improve Meta Quest (
Learn more
). The data described in this paragraph is sent to and stored on our servers and will be disassociated from your account when we no longer need it to provide the service or improve the hand and body tracking feature. If you delete your account, the data associated with your account will be deleted or disassociated from your account.
If your device crashes, we send crash logs about your device to our servers, which may contain recently generated estimated body scale and estimated hand and body pose data, as well as other information about your interactions with the hand and body tracking feature, consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. This data will be stored on Meta servers until no longer necessary to provide hand and body tracking or until your account has been deleted – whichever comes first.
What data is shared
Hand and body tracking in applications
When you enable hand and body tracking and choose to use an application from the Meta Horizon Store (including the Rift Store) that supports this feature, the app will collect your abstracted hand and body data. If you use an app offered by Meta, the app will use this data consistent with this Privacy Notice and our
Privacy Policy
. If you use a third-party app, the app will process your abstracted hand and body data in accordance with the app developers' privacy policies. App developers are only permitted to use this data for purposes outlined in the
Developer Data Use Policy
, which describes how developers must handle user data. But we do not control how a third-party app uses, stores or shares your abstracted hand and body data. Please read the developers' privacy policies to understand how they process your data. Also see our
Privacy Policy
for more information about how third parties access your data.
Hand and body tracking on websites
When you enable hand and body tracking and choose to visit a third-party website that supports this feature, the website may collect your estimated hand and body pose data. You will receive a notice when you visit a website that requests access to this data and you can decline the request. Meta does not control how third-party websites use, store or share your estimated hand and body pose data once they've collected it, so you should only allow access to this data by websites that you trust.

META QUEST
Eye Tracking Privacy Notice
Effective from 5 April 2024
What is eye tracking?
Eye tracking is a feature on your Meta Quest Pro headset (also referred to as Meta Quest Pro device) that uses cameras to estimate the direction of where your eyes are looking. This feature is used to make your avatar's eye contact and facial expressions look more natural during your virtual interactions with other users and to improve the image quality within the area where you are looking. Eye tracking may also be used as an input (similar to
hand tracking
), meaning that you can interact with virtual content based on where you're looking. Eye tracking is not used to identify you. You can turn eye tracking on and off in Settings and control which apps can access eye tracking on your Meta Quest Pro headset.
How eye tracking works
When eye tracking is enabled
When you choose to enable eye tracking on the headset or in a specific app, software on the Meta Quest Pro headset analyses images of your eyes ("raw image data") to create an estimate of where your eyes are looking ("abstracted gaze data"). This estimation is done on your device in real time as your eyes move. The raw image data is deleted from your headset after the abstracted gaze data has been generated. The abstracted gaze data is processed on your headset or Meta servers (e.g. the data may be processed on Meta servers to animate your avatar's eye contact in a multiplayer scenario), and continuously generated and overwritten in real time as it provides this feature.
Calibrating eye tracking
After you've enabled eye tracking, you'll have the option to calibrate this feature. Calibration allows your headset to adjust the eye tracking software for a more comfortable, accurate and higher-quality viewing experience. If you complete calibration, your headset will generate and store a set of numerical correction factors for each eye ("calibration data") so that the headset software can more accurately estimate the direction of where you are looking. For example, calibration data allows the software to correct for glasses, contact lenses and general inaccuracies of the software. If you've already calibrated eye tracking, you can always go through calibration again for enhanced accuracy. Calibration data is only stored on the headset except in the event of a headset crash (see more information below), and is not shared with any apps. If you no longer want your headset calibrated or no longer wish to use the device, you can delete your calibration data at any time by going to
Settings
, selecting
Movement tracking
and then
Eye tracking
. Click
Delete
next to
Calibrate eye tracking
. Otherwise, the data will be deleted when you delete your account.
If you enable eye tracking without calibrating, the headset will still process your data as described in the "When eye tracking is enabled" section, but without the calibration data, which may limit the accuracy of the feature.
If another person uses your account on your Meta Quest Pro when you have enabled eye tracking, the raw image data, calibration data and abstracted gaze data (collectively, "eye tracking data") from such person may also be processed unless they turn off the feature. You can only permit other people to use the feature through your account if they have enabled it through their accounts or if you are their legally authorised representative.
How to enable eye tracking
For the device
To enable this feature for the device, navigate to
Settings
, select
Movement tracking
and select
Eye tracking
. Toggle eye tracking on to enable it. You can disable eye tracking at any time by toggling the feature off across the device and all apps in
Settings
. You can also temporarily pause eye tracking across the device and all apps in
Quick actions
at any time.
For apps
Additionally, you control which apps can use eye tracking. To enable or disable eye tracking for a specific app, navigate to
Settings
, select
Apps
and select
Installed apps
. After selecting the relevant app, toggle
eye tracking
on or off. If eye tracking is not enabled for the device, it cannot be enabled for any app. You can also temporarily pause eye tracking across the device and all apps in
Quick actions
at any time.
What data is collected
Eye tracking function
If you choose to enable eye tracking, the raw image data will be processed in real time on your headset and deleted once processing has been completed. We do not collect or store raw image data from the eye tracking feature on Meta servers. The abstracted gaze data is generated in real time on your headset, and processed on device or Meta servers to animate your avatar's eye contact and facial expressions, improve the image quality where you are looking and/or to interact with virtual content. For example, if you choose to give an app offered by Meta access to your eye tracking data, the abstracted gaze data may be processed on Meta servers in order to animate your avatar's eye contact and facial expressions in a multiplayer scenario. If you choose to calibrate eye tracking, the calibration data will be stored on your device until you've chosen to delete this data in your device settings or you've deleted your account.
We collect and retain certain data about your interactions with eye tracking as required for the feature to work properly and to provide the feature, consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. For example, we collect and retain information about tracking quality and the amount of time that it takes to detect your eyes. If you have chosen to share additional data with Meta, we collect additional data about how you use your headset (including eye tracking) to help Meta personalise your experiences and improve Meta Quest.
Learn more
. Data sent to and stored on our servers will be disassociated from your account when we no longer need it to provide the service or improve the eye tracking feature. If you delete your account, the data associated with your account will be deleted or disassociated from your account.
Headset crash logs
If your headset crashes, we send crash logs about your headset to our servers, which may contain recently generated abstracted gaze data, calibration data and other information about your interactions with the eye tracking feature consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. Crash logs will not include raw image data of your eyes. Crash logs will be stored on Meta servers until no longer necessary to provide the service or until your account has been deleted – whichever comes first.
What data is shared with apps
You can see if an app supports eye tracking before you download or purchase the app. The app's product page will include the
indicating that the app supports eye tracking.
When you enable eye tracking on your device and use an app from the Meta Horizon Store (including the Rift Store) that uses eye tracking, you'll be asked to give the app access to your eye tracking data. You can choose not to allow access. If you choose to allow access, the app will receive your abstracted gaze data in real time while you are in the app. Raw image data and calibration data are not shared with apps, even if you choose to allow access to eye tracking data.
If you share your data with an app offered by Meta, the app will use your abstracted gaze data in accordance with this notice and our
Privacy Policy
.
If you share your data with a third-party app, the app will process your abstracted gaze data in accordance with the app developers' privacy policies. App developers are only permitted to use this data for purposes outlined in the
Developer Data Use Policy
, which describes how developers must handle user data. But we do not control how a third-party app uses, stores or shares your abstracted gaze data, so you should only allow access to your data to apps that you trust. See our
Privacy Policy
for more information about how third parties access your data.
Note: Fit adjustment and natural facial expressions are separate features and not included in this eye tracking feature or this notice. For information about how enabling fit adjustment or natural facial expressions on the Meta Quest Pro headset uses data, please review
Fit Adjustment Privacy Notice
and the
Natural Facial Expressions Privacy Notice
. If you choose to not enable eye tracking, the direction that your avatar is looking will be based on the position of your headset.

META QUEST
Natural Facial Expressions Privacy Notice
Effective from 5 April 2024
What is natural facial expressions
Natural facial expressions is a feature on your Meta Quest Pro headset (also called your Meta Quest Pro device) that uses cameras to estimate how your face is moving. This feature is used to make your avatar's expressions look more natural by detecting your facial movements and mirroring them. Natural facial expressions is not used to identify you. You can turn natural facial expressions on and off in Settings and control which apps can access this feature on your Meta Quest Pro headset.
How natural facial expressions work
When natural facial expressions is enabled
When you choose to enable natural facial expressions on the headset or in a specific app, software on the Meta Quest Pro headset analyses images of your face ("raw image data") to create an estimate of how your face is moving, producing a set of generic facial expressions, such as a broad smile or frown, ("abstracted facial expressions data") that animate your avatar. This estimation is done on your device in real time as your face moves. The raw image data is deleted from your headset after the abstracted facial expressions data has been generated. The abstracted facial expressions data is processed on your headset or Meta servers (e.g. the data may be processed on Meta servers to animate your avatar's facial movements in a multiplayer scenario), and continuously generated and overwritten in real time as it provides this feature. If you also enable
eye tracking
, your headset will process data about where you are looking to make your avatar's eyes more expressive (e.g. mirroring your eyelid movement). If you enable your microphone, your headset will process your audio data to animate your avatar's lip and face movement.
If another person uses your account on your Meta Quest Pro when you have enabled natural facial expressions, the raw image data and abstracted facial expressions data (collectively, "natural facial expressions data") from such person may also be processed unless they turn off the feature. You can permit other people to use the feature through your account only if they have enabled it through their accounts or if you are their legally authorised representative.
How to enable natural facial expressions
For the device
To enable this feature on the device, navigate to
Settings
, select
Movement tracking
, and select
Natural facial expressions
. Toggle
Natural facial expressions
on to enable it. You can disable natural facial expressions at any time by toggling the feature off across the device and all apps in
Settings
. You can also temporarily pause natural facial expressions across the device and all apps in
Quick actions
at any time.
For apps
In addition, you control which apps can use natural facial expressions. To enable or disable natural facial expressions for a specific app, navigate to
Settings
, select
Apps
and select
Installed apps
. After selecting the relevant app, toggle
Natural facial expressions
on or off. If natural facial expressions is not enabled on the device, it cannot be enabled for any app. You can also temporarily pause natural facial expressions across the device and all apps in
Quick actions
at any time.
What data is collected
Natural facial expressions function
If you choose to enable natural facial expressions, the raw image data is processed in real time on your headset and deleted once processing has been completed. We do not collect or store raw image data from the natural facial expressions feature on Meta servers. The abstracted facial expressions data is generated in real time on your headset, and processed on device or Meta servers to animate your avatar's facial expressions. For example, if you choose to give an app offered by Meta access to your natural facial expressions data, the abstracted facial expressions data may be processed on Meta servers in order to animate your avatar's facial movement in a multiplayer scenario.
We collect and retain certain data about your interactions with natural facial expressions as required for the feature to work properly and to provide the feature, consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. For example, we collect and retain information about how the headset fit affects the quality of detected facial movements or how much time it takes to detect your facial movements. If you have chosen to share additional data with Meta, we collect additional data about how you use your headset (including natural facial expressions) to help Meta personalise your experiences and improve Meta Quest.
Learn more
. Data sent to and stored on our servers will be disassociated from your account when we no longer need it to provide the service or improve the natural facial expressions feature. If you delete your account, the data associated with your account will be deleted or disassociated from your account.
Headset crash logs
If your headset crashes, we send crash logs about your headset to our servers, which may contain recently generated abstracted facial expressions data and other information about your interactions with the natural expressions feature consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. Crash logs will not include raw image data of your face. Crash logs are stored on Meta servers until no longer necessary to provide the service or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first.
What data is shared with apps
You can see if an app supports natural facial expressions before you download or purchase the app. The app's product page will include the
indicating that the app supports natural facial expressions.
When you enable natural facial expressions on your device and use an app from the Meta Horizon Store (including the Rift Store) that uses this feature, you'll be asked to give the app access to your natural facial expressions data. You can choose not to allow access. If you choose to allow access, the app will receive your abstracted facial expressions data in real time while you are in the app. Raw image data is not shared with apps, even if you choose to allow access to natural facial expressions data.
If you share your data with an app offered by Meta, the app will use your abstracted facial expressions data in accordance with this notice and our
Privacy Policy
.
If you share your data with a third-party app, the app will process your abstracted facial expressions data in accordance with the app developers' privacy policies. App developers are only permitted to use this data for purposes outlined in the
Developer Data Use Policy
, which describes how developers must handle user data. But we do not control how a third-party app uses, stores or shares your abstracted facial expressions data, so you should only allow access to your data by apps that you trust. See our
Privacy Policy
for more information about how third parties access your data.
Note: Fit adjustment and eye tracking are separate features, and not included in this natural facial expressions feature or this notice. For information about how enabling fit adjustment and eye tracking on the Meta Quest Pro headset uses data, please review
Fit Adjustment Privacy Notice
and the
Eye Tracking Privacy Notice
. If you choose to not enable natural facial expressions, the headset will not process any natural facial expressions data, and any avatar facial movements will be based on audio where the microphone is enabled. See our
Privacy Policy
for more information about audio data.

META QUEST
Fit Adjustment Privacy Notice
Effective from 5 April 2024
What is fit adjustment
Fit adjustment is a feature on your Meta Quest Pro headset (also called your Meta Quest Pro device) that helps ensure that your headset is fitted optimally for better comfort, visual clarity and experience. When you use the fit adjustment feature, your headset uses its cameras to detect the position of your eyes and lower face to check whether your headset is aligned optimally and provides headset adjustment tips. Fit adjustment is not used to identify you. You can turn fit adjustment on and off in Settings on your Meta Quest Pro headset.
How fit adjustment works
When you choose to enable fit adjustment, software on the Meta Quest Pro headset analyses images of your eyes and lower face ("raw image data") to determine the headset's approximate position relative to certain parts of your face, such as your eyes, mouth and jawline. Then it compares them to a set of generic positions. This analysis is done in real time on your headset and the comparison results in "abstracted fit adjustment data", which reflects the difference between your headset fit and the optimum fit. The raw image data is deleted from your headset after the abstracted fit adjustment data is generated. The abstracted fit adjustment data is constantly overwritten on your device as it provides this feature.
As part of enabling fit adjustment, you will be guided through a series of steps to adjust your headset to ensure a proper initial fit. If you skip a fit adjustment step or your device times out on a step, your headset will store this skip preference in the device memory to avoid prompting you again. Later, if a misalignment or improper fit is detected, your headset will prompt you to readjust your headset's fitting.
If another person uses your account on your Meta Quest Pro when you have enabled fit adjustment, the raw image data and abstracted fit adjustment data (collectively, "fit adjustment data") from such person may also be processed unless they turn off the feature. You can only permit other people to use the feature through your account if they have enabled it through their accounts or if you are their legally authorised representative.
How to enable fit adjustment
To enable this feature for the device navigate to
Settings
, select
Accessibility
and select
Fit adjustment
. Toggle
Fit adjustment
on to enable it. You can disable fit adjustment at any time by toggling the feature off in
Settings
.
What data is collected
Fit adjustment function
If you choose to enable fit adjustment, the raw image data is processed in real time on your headset and deleted once processing is complete. We do not collect or store raw image data from the fit adjustment feature on Meta servers.
We collect and retain certain data about your interactions with fit adjustment as required for the feature to work properly and to provide the feature, consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. For example, we collect and retain information about whether a user completed the setup process or how long the setup process took. If you have chosen to share additional data with Meta, we collect additional data about how you use your headset and controllers to help Meta personalise your experiences and improve Meta Quest.
Learn more
. Data sent to and stored on our servers will be disassociated from your account when we no longer need it to provide the service or improve the fit adjustment feature. If you delete your account, the data associated with your account will be deleted or disassociated from your account.
Headset crash logs
If your headset crashes, we send crash logs about your headset to our servers, which may contain recently generated abstracted fit adjustment data and other information about your interactions with the fit adjustment feature consistent with our
Privacy Policy
. Crash logs will not include raw image data of your eyes or face. Crash logs are stored on Meta servers until they are no longer necessary to provide the service or until your account is deleted, whichever comes first.
What data is shared with apps
Fit adjustment is a device feature that does not share any data with any Meta-provided apps or third-party apps.
Note: Eye tracking and natural facial expressions are separate features, and not included in this fit adjustment feature or this notice. For information about how enabling natural facial expressions or eye tracking on the Meta Quest Pro headset uses data, please review the
Natural Facial Expressions Privacy Notice
and
Eye Tracking Privacy Notice
. If you choose not to enable fit adjustment, no fit adjustment data will be processed nor will you receive any fit adjustment instructions.

Generative AI
AI at Meta
We’re excited to bring generative AI technology to our products. That’s why we’re developing AI at Meta, a collection of generative AI features and experiences in our apps, along with the models that power them. Learn more about generative AI, how we use your information for AI at Meta and the controls you have.

How Meta works with select partners to improve AI responses
Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. That means if you ask about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer.
That's why we work with select partners, so we can bring you the most relevant information.
Meta sometimes shares the messages you send to our AIs and general information, like your region, with these partners so you can get better results. We don't send personally identifying information, like your username, unless you include it in your messages to the AIs.
These partners have their own privacy policies that describe how they use this information we share.

Voice Controls Privacy Notice
Effective from 18 November 2024
Meta AI and voice controls on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Ray-Ban Stories
What can you do with Meta AI on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses?
The voice services available to you depend on the version of your smart glasses and your location. Meta AI allows you to do things such as get information, capture photos and videos, play music, and call and message with your voice when using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
Voice interactions are things that you say while using our voice services, such as voice controls or Meta AI, with Meta's smart glasses, including if you inadvertently activate our voice services, as well as any background sound that happens when you are interacting with our voice services. Voice interactions include both things that you say when you use a wake word (for example, if your smart glasses are playing music and you say "Hey Meta, pause the music") and also when you don't use a wake word for certain interactions (saying "pause music" if your smart glasses are playing music or "play message" after we tell you that you have a new message).
If you have Meta AI enabled, your Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses will activate when they detect the wake word (for instance, "Hey Meta" or another wake word, if available) so that it can respond to your voice. You can also activate Meta AI to respond to your voice by pressing and holding the touchpad, if the touchpad has been designated to activate Meta AI in your app settings. During a response from Meta AI, you can also issue additional commands, such as "stop" or "cancel".
What information does Meta collect when I use Meta AI on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses?
When you use Meta AI with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, we process voice recordings of your voice to create text transcripts of what you say, as well as data related to your voice interactions, to respond to your requests. Related data includes information, such as the hardware version of your glasses and the length of the audio related to your interaction.
You can choose to store your voice recordings to help improve other Meta products. When storage is enabled, audio recordings are stored to help Meta's products better understand and fulfil requests. We use machine learning and trained reviewers to process this data to improve Meta's products. Even with voice recording storage off, you can still use Meta AI. You can also access and delete recordings in your voice activity log.
Trained reviewers are useful in evaluating how well Meta's products respond to your voice. For example, reviewers can evaluate if Meta's smart glasses actually played the next song following a command such as "Hey Meta, next song", and help improve Meta's voice services to respond more accurately over time. Making sure that our products can understand and respond to a wide range of speech patterns, phrases, local dialects and accents is important to us. Trained reviewers are particularly helpful in identifying voice interactions that machines are likely to misinterpret.
What information does Meta collect when I use voice controls?
If you enable voice controls on your smart glasses, we process voice recordings of your voice to create text transcripts of what you say, as well as data related to your voice interactions, such as the hardware version of your glasses and the length of the audio related to your interaction to respond to your requests.
You can choose to store your voice recordings and text transcripts and related data about your voice interactions to help improve Meta's voice controls and other Meta products. When storage is enabled, audio recordings and text transcripts and related data from your voice interactions are stored to help Meta's products better understand and fulfil requests. We use machine learning and trained reviewers to process this data to improve our voice controls and other Meta products. You can turn voice storage off in settings at any time. Even with storage off, you can still use voice controls. You can also access and delete stored information in your settings.
How does Meta use my voice recordings and related transcripts?
We primarily use recordings and transcripts to process and carry out your requests. Based on your settings, we may also use stored recordings to help improve Meta's products. When storage of voice recordings for product improvement is enabled, we use machine learning and trained reviewers to process information to improve, troubleshoot and train Meta's products.
Storing your voice recordings will help Meta's products better understand and fulfil requests, as well as respond to a wide range of speech patterns, phrases, local dialects and accents. For example, people that speak a regional dialect and have storage of their voice recordings enabled will help Meta's products better understand and more accurately respond to requests from people that speak that regional dialect.
How does Meta protect my privacy during human review?
We have a team of vetted and trained personnel who assist in reviewing stored voice recordings. These individuals must comply with strict privacy and security requirements in their handling of this information. We use controlled and monitored systems to ensure that they only access the information required to complete product improvement training tasks. And we protect your privacy by changing the pitch of voice recordings when they are reviewed.
How long does Meta store information related to my voice interactions?
When storage has been enabled, we will store voice recordings even if you unintentionally activate a voice interaction. If our systems detect that you didn't intend to activate a voice interaction, we will label these voice interactions as "false wakes" or misactivations, and delete them within 90 days of detection. Stored voice recordings are otherwise stored for up to one year to help improve Meta's products. You can delete stored voice recordings sooner in your voice activity log. After deletion, they will no longer be used to improve Meta products.
How do I manage voice storage and access or delete my voice interactions?
To manage your storage of voice interactions
:
From the Meta View app, tap
in the bottom right.
Tap
Voice
, or tap your glasses then tap
Voice
.
Tap
Voice storage
.
From here, you can adjust your storage settings of voice recordings and transcripts and related data about your voice interactions.
There are two storage settings: one for audio recordings and one for transcripts and related data. Bear in mind that if storage of transcripts and related data about your voice interactions is turned off, you won't be able to store voice recordings.
To view or delete your stored voice interactions in voice activity log
:
From the Meta View app, tap
in the bottom right.
Tap
Voice
, or tap your glasses then tap
Voice
.
Tap
Activity log
.
You can tap
next to a voice interaction to delete it or tap Delete all at the top to delete all voice interactions. Deleting a recording and transcript will also delete the data associated with that interaction.
Even if storage is turned off, you can still use voice controls. When storage of audio recordings and transcripts and related data is turned off, we will delete all audio recordings or transcripts of your voice interactions immediately after processing, which means you won't be able to hear, view or delete this information. We also won't use your voice interactions to improve Meta's products, and voice recordings won't be reviewed by trained reviewers. Any voice interactions that occurred before you turned off storage will still be stored for up to one year, unless you delete them sooner.
Download your information
You can view and download stored transcripts and related data, such as the serial number of your glasses or the general category of your voice interaction with the View your information and Download your information tools. You can access these tools from the Meta View app.
