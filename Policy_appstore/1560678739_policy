Purpose and Scope
At Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd, we are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable experience for our guests, as well as a positive, respectful, and professional environment for our staff. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behaviour to ensure our locations remain inclusive and pleasant spaces for everyone.
We expect all employees, guests, and third parties associated with Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd to adhere to a shared standard of conduct while engaging with our business, both on and off our premises.
Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd has a zero-tolerance policy toward unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a respectful and secure environment for all patrons and staff. Any report or complaint of inappropriate conduct will be taken seriously, and we will address all incidents promptly and appropriately. If you experience or witness behaviour that goes against our standards, we encourage you to report it, knowing that Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd will take decisive action to ensure a positive atmosphere for everyone.
This Code of Conduct will be prominently featured on our company website, included in the employee handbook, and provided to all new employees, suppliers, and third-party contractors. This policy is applicable to all employees, Company Directors, guests, and third-party contractors. It extends to anyone on company property, during company time, at company events, as well as to those residing in or visiting company accommodations.
Expected Behaviours
Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd is committed to providing an environment that is comfortable and free from all forms of bullying and harassment. We do not tolerate harassment of our employees, guests, contractors or suppliers in any form.
Some examples of unacceptable behaviour that Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd refuses to tolerate to ensure we foster a safe, respectful and productive environment for everyone are set out below:
1. Discrimination and Harassment
Any form of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.
Harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying, intimidation, or any behaviour that creates a hostile or offensive work environment.
2. Violence and Threatening Behaviour
Physical violence, threats of violence, or any aggressive behaviour that could harm others.
Verbal abuse, including shouting, swearing, or derogatory remarks.
3. Substance Abuse
Use, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs or substances on company property or during company time.
Misuse of alcohol or prescription drugs that impairs an individual’s ability to work or poses a safety risk to themselves or others.
4. Dishonesty and Fraud
Theft, embezzlement, or unauthorised use of company funds, property, or resources.
Falsifying records, reports, or any other form of dishonesty that could harm the company or its stakeholders.
5. Confidentiality Violations
Unauthorised disclosure of confidential company information, including trade secrets, financial data, or personal information about employees, clients, or partners.
Misuse of proprietary information or intellectual property.
6. Conflict of Interest
Engaging in activities that create a conflict of interest with the company’s interests, such as accepting gifts, payments, or other benefits from competitors or clients.

Tampering with or neglecting safety equipment or protective gear.

9. Misuse of Company Property
Unauthorised use of company equipment, or other resources for personal gain.

10. Unprofessional Conduct
Engaging in behaviours that are unprofessional or that damage the company’s reputation, including inappropriate attire, unprofessional language, or insubordination.
Violation of any company policies or procedures not explicitly listed here but integral to the company’s operation and culture.
Power Dynamics & Work Relationships
It is unrealistic to expect that people will not develop relationships at work, however Urban Pubs & Bars Ltd values professionalism and fairness in workplace relationships, particularly when power dynamics are involved, such as between managers and direct reports.
Employees must maintain boundaries to prevent personal relationships from impacting work performance or creating conflicts of interest. Relationships involving power imbalances should be disclosed to HR to ensure fair management. Any form of coercion or favouritism is prohibited, and employees are encouraged to report concerns confidentially. The company is committed to addressing issues promptly to uphold a respectful and equitable work environment.
Private Accommodation in a Place of Work
Enjoying a drink with colleagues after a shift can be a great way to unwind, but it’s important to recognise the difference between drinking in a public setting, like a pub, and in your private accommodation, especially if you live where you work. Living and working in the same place can blur the lines between personal and professional spaces, so it’s essential to set clear boundaries. Once you cross into a private setting, managing inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour can become more challenging, making it all the more important to maintain those distinctions.
The same professional conduct expected in the general workplace applies to any private accommodation areas. Inappropriate behaviour, including any conduct that violates the company’s respect, diversity, or harassment policies, is not tolerated in these spaces.
Any concerns or incidents related to private accommodation should be reported to management or HR. Reports will be handled confidentially, and violations of these policies may result in disciplinary action.
Reporting Concerns and Ensuring a Respectful Workplace
Everyone—whether employees or third parties—can easily and, if preferred, anonymously report their concerns. You can do this by contacting your site manager, a colleague, or any member of the senior team at Urban Pubs & Bars Limited or emailing
people@urbanpubsandbars.com
.
Every report is taken seriously, thoroughly investigated, and followed up with the individual who raised the concern. To maintain fairness, we may bring in independent investigators when necessary.
All management are expected to fully uphold and support the code of conduct. This will be demonstrated through actions, not just words.
Addressing Unacceptable Behaviour
If you believe you have been subjected to unacceptable behaviour, whether from a colleague, supplier, or a guest, we encourage you to take the following steps:
Calmly ask the individual(s) to stop.
Identify the behaviour and inform a member of management or a colleague you trust.
If the behaviour persists, management will conduct a full investigation. Complaints may be escalated within the business if needed.
Complaints of unacceptable behaviour are treated with the utmost seriousness and handled confidentially by all levels of management. Each complaint will be fully investigated. Should unacceptable behaviour be found, it will be considered a disciplinary offense and could lead to dismissal for gross misconduct. In some cases, such behaviour may be unlawful, potentially leading to criminal prosecution or civil action against both the employer and the individual responsible.
Urban Pubs and Bars Limited is fully committed to creating a safe, respectful, and supportive environment for all colleagues and guests. Everyone deserves a workplace free from harassment, bullying, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind.

CCTV Policy
1. Policy statement
1.1 We believe that CCTV and other surveillance systems have a legitimate role to play in helping to maintain a safe and secure environment for all our staff and visitors. However, we recognise that this may raise concerns about the effect on individuals and their privacy. This policy is intended to address such concerns. Images recorded by surveillance systems are personal data which must be processed in accordance with data protection laws. We are committed to complying with our legal obligations and ensuring that the legal rights of staff, relating to their personal data, are recognised and respected.
2. Definitions
For the purposes of this policy, the following terms have the following meanings:
CCTV: means fixed and domed cameras designed to capture and record images of individuals and property.
Privacy Statement: The Urban Pubs & Bars privacy policy can be found on website
here
Surveillance systems: means any devices or systems designed to monitor or record images of individuals or information relating to individuals. The term includes CCTV systems as well as:
any technology that may be introduced in the future such as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR);
body worn cameras; or
any other systems that capture information of identifiable individuals or information relating to identifiable individuals.
3. About this policy
3.1 We currently use CCTV cameras to view and record individuals on our premises. This policy outlines why we use CCTV, how we will use CCTV and how we will process data recorded by CCTV cameras to ensure we are compliant with data protection law and best practice.
3.2 We recognise that information that we hold about individuals is subject to data protection legislation. The images of individuals recorded by CCTV cameras are personal data and therefore subject to the legislation. We are committed to complying with all our legal obligations and seek to comply with best practice suggestions from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
3.3 This policy covers all our customers, visiting members of the public, employees, workers and contractors.
3.4 This policy will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it meets legal requirements, relevant guidance published by the ICO and industry standards.
4. Reasons for the use of CCTV
4.1 We currently use CCTV as outlined below. We believe that such use is necessary for legitimate business purposes, including:
(a) to comply with our licensing conditions;
(b) to prevent crime and protect buildings and assets from damage, disruption, vandalism and other crime;
(c) for the personal safety of staff, visitors and other members of the public and to act as a deterrent against crime;
(d) to support law enforcement bodies in the prevention, detection and prosecution of crime;
(e) to assist in day-to-day management, including ensuring the health and safety of staff and others; or
(f) to assist in the effective resolution of disputes,
This list is not exhaustive and other purposes may be or become relevant.
5. Monitoring
5.1 Images are monitored by authorised personnel when required pursuant to clause 4.
5.2 Staff using surveillance systems will be given appropriate training to ensure they understand and observe the legal requirements related to the processing of relevant data.
6. How we will operate any CCTV
6.1 Where possible, we will display signs at the entrance of the surveillance zone to alert individuals that their image may be recorded.
6.2 We will ensure that live feeds from cameras and recorded images are only viewed by approved members of staff whose role requires them to have access to such data. Recorded images will only be viewed in designated, secure offices.
7. Use of data gathered by CCTV
7.1 In order to ensure that the rights of individuals recorded by the CCTV system are protected, we will ensure that data gathered from CCTV cameras is stored in a way that maintains its integrity and security. This may include encrypting the data, where it is possible to do so.
7.2 Given the large amount of data generated by surveillance systems, we may store video footage using a cloud computing system. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any cloud service provider maintains the security of our information, in accordance with industry standards.
7.3 We may engage data processors to process data on our behalf. We will ensure reasonable contractual safeguards are in place to protect the security and integrity of the data.
8. Retention and erasure of data gathered by CCTV
8.1 Data recorded by the CCTV system will be stored. Data from CCTV cameras will not be retained indefinitely but will be permanently deleted once there is no reason to retain the recorded information. Exactly how long images will be retained for will vary according to the purpose for which they are being recorded. For example, where images are being recorded for crime prevention purposes, data will be kept long enough only for incidents to come to light. In all other cases, recorded images will be kept for no longer than 30 days.
8.2 At the end of their useful life, all images stored in whatever format will be erased permanently and securely. Any physical matter such as tapes or discs will be disposed of as confidential waste. Any still photographs and hard copy prints will be disposed of as confidential waste.
9. Requests for disclosure
9.1 We may share data with other group companies and other associated companies or organisations, for example shared services partners where we consider that this is reasonably necessary for any of the legitimate purposes set out above in paragraph 4.1.
9.2 No images from our CCTV cameras will be disclosed to any other third party, without express permission being given by our data protection officer (who’s details can be found in our Privacy Statement) (DPO). Data will not normally be released unless satisfactory evidence required for legal proceedings or under a court order has been produced.
9.3 In other appropriate circumstances, we may allow law enforcement agencies to view or remove CCTV footage where this is required in the detection or prosecution of crime.
9.4 We will maintain a record of all disclosures of CCTV footage.
9.5 No images from CCTV will ever be posted online or disclosed to the media.
10. Subject access requests
10.1 You may request disclosure of your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. These requests are to be emailed to
privacy@urbanpubsandbars.com
10.2 In order for us to locate relevant footage, any requests for copies of recorded CCTV images must include the date and time of the recording, the location where the footage was captured and, if necessary, information identifying the individual.
10.3 We reserve the right to obscure images of third parties when disclosing CCTV data as part of a subject access request, where we consider it necessary to do so.
10.3.1 If this is not possible for any reason we reserve the right to invite you to a private viewing of the CCTV footage.
11. Requests to prevent processing
