What is an event app?
Mobile event apps are applications designed to be installed on modern smartphones. They help attendees navigate an event by providing important information such as agendas, maps, session information, attendee profiles, and more. They also provide features that encourage attendees to participate in sessions, increase their overall engagement and enjoy the event more.
What should an event app have?
While this depends largely on the event type, as various features support certain aspects of each event. Typically, most event apps have the following requirements:
Content discovery:
event info, agendas, exhibitors
Engagement features:
gamification, polling, Q&A, surveys
Monetization
: lead generation and brand awareness
Reporting
What are the benefits of an event app?
An event app can have several positive effects on an event. Most frequently the main benefits of having an app include the following:
Cost savings:
reduction in printing needs such as schedules and signage. Additionally, event apps can alleviate staffing for ushers, info desk personnel, mic runners, etc
Changes and updates:
Events are fluid, and things happen. Room changes, speaker cancellations, and last-minute changes can be immediately communicated to attendees no matter where they are
Modern feel to the event:
Let’s face it, no one wants to lug around an event guide anymore. Going digital is convenient, sustainable, and accessible for your attendees. Plus, they look great and adhere to your desired brand experience
Creating a digital footprint
that can be monitored and managed. Lead generation, attendee satisfaction, and attendee behaviors can be collected, tracked, and managed via an event app
What is the purpose of an event app?
Event apps are created to ensure that attendees have a positive event experience. By taking advantage of the devices already in their pockets, event apps ensure attendees have not only the information they need about the event but a way to engage directly with it.
How do event apps contribute to an event management platform?
Event apps are the “engagement” part of the event experience, usually leveraged during the event. Event management changes radically before, during, and after the event. Event apps can positively affect the attendee experience when the event is going on. An event management platform allows attendees to make choices about the event experience, drive attendee behaviors during the event, and collect feedback after the event. Event apps are the key solution for the operational side of events.
