Your Rights
You have several rights under the GDPR. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:

request erasure of your personal data
request restriction of processing of your personal data
request the transfer of your personal data
object to processing of your personal data
request human intervention for automated decision making
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request access to your personal data
You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data
You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your account and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to request that PLT delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data
You have a right to ask PLT to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
Request the transfer of your personal data
You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.
Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data.

We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Right to lodge a complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance.
Your data and countries outside of Europe
The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available at
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.

You may exercise these rights yourself or through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights, please see

Request to know the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you and how we have used it.
Request access to your Personal Information.
Request correction of your Personal Information.
Request deletion of your Personal Information.
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your personal data, as described further below.
Right to Know

Access to Specific Pieces of Information (Data Portability).
You also have the right to request that PLT provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request).
Correction
You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account page and updating your details directly.
Deletion
You have the right to request that PLT delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:

Writing to us at: Boohoo Group Legal Team, 8587 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, 90069, USA
If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request.
Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an
Authorized Agent
, see Authorized Agents below.
All Consumer Requests must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such a person. This may include:
Verifying Personal Information that we may already have about you, such as prior order numbers, address / ZIP code, and other similar information.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent.
Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
.
Authorized Agents
You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights.
In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
“Sale” of Your Personal Information
As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.
“Sharing” of Your Personal Information
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age.

This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your new choice.

We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”

Your Rights
You have several rights under the GDPR. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:
request access to your personal data
request correction of your personal data
request erasure of your personal data
request restriction of processing of your personal data
request the transfer of your personal data
object to processing of your personal data
request human intervention for automated decision making
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request access to your personal data
You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data
You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your account and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to request that PLT delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data
You have a right to ask PLT to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
Request the transfer of your personal data
You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.
Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Right to lodge a complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance.
Your data and countries outside of Europe
The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available at
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.
How long we keep your data for
We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain data are available on request.

Request access to your Personal Information.
Request correction of your Personal Information.
Request deletion of your Personal Information.
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your personal data, as described further below.
Right to Know
You have the right to request that PLT disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request).
Access to Specific Pieces of Information (Data Portability).
You also have the right to request that PLT provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request).
Correction
You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account page and updating your details directly.
Deletion
You have the right to request that PLT delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights
To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:
Emailing us at
DPO@prettylittlething.com
Writing to us at: Boohoo Group Legal Team, 8587 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, 90069, USA
If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request.
Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an
Authorized Agent
, see Authorized Agents below.
All Consumer Requests must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such a person. This may include:
Verifying Personal Information that we may already have about you, such as prior order numbers, address / ZIP code, and other similar information.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent.
Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
.
Authorized Agents
You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights.
In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV file(s) and/or PDF file(s).
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information
“Sale” of Your Personal Information
As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.
“Sharing” of Your Personal Information
If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.
How You May Opt-Out of Our Sale or Sharing of Your Personal Information
To exercise the right to opt-out of the “sale” and the “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below. You may also opt-out of such “sales” and “sharing” by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites. You can find more information about cookies at
http://www.allaboutcookies.org
and
http://youronlinechoices.eu
.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time by:
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through cookies by adjusting your cookie preferences or by following the above link, you may simply re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you have opted out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information through the use of a browser privacy control signal, you may turn off the signal and re-adjust your cookie preferences.
If you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your new choice.
Browser Privacy Control Signals
You may also exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the “sharing” of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers:
Global privacy control (for more information on how to configure your browser to send this signal, please see
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
).
When we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further “sales” or “sharing” of your Personal Information when you interact with our websites or applications through that browser and on that device. We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”
Your Choices Regarding our Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information
As further described below, we do not use or disclose your Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than the following:
To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average Consumer who requests such goods or services;
To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that our use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for such purposes;
To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at PLT and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that our use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose;
To ensure the safety of natural persons, provided that our use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose;
For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of your current interaction with us, provided that the Personal Information is not disclosed to another third-party and is not used to build a profile about you or otherwise alter your experience outside the current interaction with us;
To perform services on behalf of us, such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage, or providing similar services on behalf of us; and
To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.
Financial Incentives
We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
In determining the value of your Personal Information we collect as part of your participation in our financial incentives, we consider:
the revenue generated by PLT of the sale, collection, or deletion of your Personal Information, which we have calculated to be $.163.
Personal Information Retention Periods
We will keep your Personal Information for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain Personal Information are available on request.
Other California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (California’s “Shine the Light” law) permits users of our websites that are California residents and who provide Personal Information in obtaining products and services for personal, family, or household use to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If applicable, this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared your Personal Information with for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2023 will receive information regarding such activities in 2022). You may request this information once per calendar year. To make such a request, please send an email to
DPO@prettylittlething.com
.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
