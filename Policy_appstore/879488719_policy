1. Purpose
Swapcard provides an app that can be accessed via
www.swapcard.com
and its subdomains, and an API (collectively, the Application) via which it offers professional event organizers (the Organizers) a turnkey solution enabling them to create a platform for each of their events (the Event Platform) that can be accessed by registered natural persons and/or people who might be interested in the event (the Attendees) and businesses taking part in the event (the Exhibitors).
‍
The Application aims to enable Attendees and Exhibitors (collectively, the Members) to share content and easily connect with each other before, during and after the Event, in order to expand their business network.
‍
The purpose of these general terms and conditions (the Terms of Use) is to lay down the procedures and conditions governing usage of the services provided by Swapcard to Members (the Services) and set out the rights and obligations of the parties within this scope.
‍
The conditions can be accessed and printed out at any time by going to the direct link at the bottom of the website page
https://swapcard.com.
‍
If required, the Terms of Use may be supplemented by conditions of use that are specific to certain Services, which would then supplement the Terms of Use, and, if contradictory, would prevail over them.
