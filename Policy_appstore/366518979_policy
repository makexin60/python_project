You are responsible for the security of the computers, electronic devices, and electronic communication methods you use to communicate with us. We are not responsible for the disclosure or interception of information you send us before we receive it.
As a standard security practice, we take reasonable steps which are generally recognized in the industry to ensure that the communication methods used to support MGM Online Services do not permit connections or communication by methods that have known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As such, if you experience trouble using an MGM website, it may be an indication that you need to upgrade your software to a newer version that supports more secure communication methods.
In situations where your Personal Information is collected by third parties under contract with us for performance of their contractual duties and other purposes, we require such third parties to exercise reasonable care to protect that information and restrict the use of your Personal Information to the purposes for which it was provided.
20. OTHER WEBSITES
We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of other websites, including websites operated by our business partners or other third parties, including websites that might be co-branded with our name. Please review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before using those sites or providing any Personal Information through such sites.

Certain of our areas and activities are intended for persons 21 or older. If you are under 21, you may not access or attempt to access any areas or participate in any activities that are restricted to persons 21 or older. We do not knowingly collect or allow the collection of Personal Information from persons under 13. We do not knowingly sell or share, as defined under applicable privacy law, the Personal Information of minors under 18 either with or without affirmative authorization.
If you are the parent or guardian of a person under 13 and believe that the person has provided us with Personal Information, you may contact us at
