In the following you can read about your rights. If you want to receive information about the data Klarna holds about you through so-called subject access, have certain data deleted or come in contact with us to exercise your other rights, the easiest way is to log into your Klarna account and make your request from there.

Right to have personal data deleted (“Right to be forgotten”).
In some cases, you have the right to have us delete personal data about you. For example, you can request us to delete personal data that we (i) no longer need for the purpose it was collected for, or (ii) process based on your consent and you revoke your consent. There are situations where Klarna is unable to delete your data, for example, when the data is still necessary to process for the purpose for which the data was collected, Klarna’s interest to process the data overrides your interest in having them deleted, or because we have a legal obligation to keep it. You can read more about our legal obligations to keep data in
section 4

6. Klarna’s profiling and automated decisions that significantly affect you.
6.1 Klarna’s profiling of you as a customer.
“Profiling” means an automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal matters, for example, by analysing or predicting your personal preferences, such as buying interests. At the same time, we compare your data with what our other customers, with similar use of our services, have preferred.
The purpose of Klarna’s profiling and the personal data types used for each occasion and for each profiling are described in detail in
section 4
above. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets “
[x]
”. The profiling for these purposes does not have a significant impact on you as a customer.
We use profiling for the following purposes:
to deliver our customised services, which customise their content and recommendations based on what we think is most interesting or relevant to you (this applies to the Klarna mobile application, its various functions such as the product expert and shopping assistants, when you interact with our customer service assistant and the order different payment methods appear at Klarna’s checkout), (Purposes [19, 38, 47, 50 and 57] in section 4)
to determine which is the most efficient way to contact you about your outstanding debt (looking at different channels, for example by sms or email, or the timing of such communication), (Purpose [25] in section 4) and
to deliver customised marketing to you across both our own and external platforms and services.  (Purposes [13 and 43] in section 4)
Our services utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to provide you with as relevant content as possible.
If you have any questions about how the profiling process works, please contact us. Contact information is available in
section 12
. You may object to our marketing profiling at any time by contacting us (and we will then cease profiling for marketing purposes). You may also end our profiling for our services by terminating the service.
6.2 Klarna’s automated decisions that significantly affect you.
Automated decisions with legal effect, or automated decisions that similarly significantly affect you, means that certain decisions in our services are completely automated, without our employees being involved. These decisions have a significant effect on you as a customer, comparable to legal effects. By making such decisions automatically, Klarna increases its objectivity and transparency in the decision to offer you these services. At the same time, you have the right to object to these decisions at all times. You can read about how to object to these decisions at the end of this section 6.2. When doing these assessments we utilise machine learning models and artificial intelligence models in order to ensure as high quality as possible in our decisions.
Automated decisions that significantly affect you also mean that profiling is performed based on your data before the decision is made. This profiling is made to assess your financial situation (before the decision to offer or grant credit, or initiate a payment), to identify whether your use of our services involves a risk of fraud or money laundering or to decide whether you are liable for a purchase. We profile your user behaviour and financial standing and compare this data with behaviours and conditions that indicate different risk levels for us.
The different user behaviour and conditions are evaluated and weighted into our automated decision-models, so that we end up with a totalling score, which then results in either accepting or rejecting your use of our Services. We can also choose to request further identification from you, if we are not sure who you are.
When does Klarna take automated decisions that significantly affect you?
The personal data types used in each decision are described in section 4. You can match the below descriptions with the purposes in section 4 above using the numbers in brackets
“[x]”
.
We make this kind of automated decision when we:
decide to approve your application, or to offer you,  to use a credit service.
decide
not
to approve your application, or
not
to offer you, to use a credit service.
These automated credit decisions are based on the data you provide to us, data from external sources such as credit bureaus' credit worthiness reports, and Klarna’s own internal information about you if we have lent you money before. In addition to information about you, Klarna’s credit model includes a large number of other factors, such as Klarna’s internal credit risk levels and our customers’ general repayment rates (based on, for example, the current product category).  (Purposes [24 and 31] in section 4).
decide whether you pose a risk of fraud, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates possible fraudulent conduct, that your behaviour is not consistent with previous use of our services, or that you have attempted to conceal your true identity. Automated decisions whereby we assess whether you constitute a fraud risk are based on information you have provided yourself, data from fraud prevention agencies (see section 7.2.3. for details of which ones we use), and Klarna’s own internal information. Klarna continuously develops our fraud models to keep our services secure, and closely investigate how fraudsters operate on different markets (for example which merchant categories or products are mostly subject to fraud attempts). (Purposes [5, 21 and 41] in section 4).
decide whether there is a risk of money laundering, if our processing shows that your behaviour indicates money laundering. In relevant cases, Klarna also investigates whether specific customers are listed on sanction lists. (Purposes [20, 29 and 34] in section 4).
decide whether you are liable for a purchase that you have disputed as “unauthorised” based on whether the information you provide, or we have about the purchase, point towards potential fraudulent behaviour or not. This by comparing what has happened in your case to other transactions indicating fraudulent behaviour. (Purpose [46] in section 4).
See
section 7
for more information about whom we share information with as regards profiling during automated decisions.
If you are not approved under the automated decisions described above, you will not have access to, or will not be able to use Klarna’s services, such as our payment methods. Klarna has several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate and fair. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of our decision models and random sampling in individual cases. If you have any concern about the outcome, you can always contact us, and we will determine whether the procedure was performed appropriately. You can also object in accordance with the following instructions.
Your right to object to these automated decisions
You always have the right to object to an automated decision with legal consequences or decisions which can otherwise significantly affect you (together with the relevant profiling) by sending an e-mail message to
privacy@klarna.co.uk
. A Klarna employee will then review the decision, taking into account any additional information and circumstances that you provide to us.
7. Who do we share your personal data with?

Those agreements include all reasonable contractual, legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure that your information is processed with an adequate level of protection and in accordance with applicable law.
7.1 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna will always share your personal information, regardless of the service you use.
7.1.1 Suppliers and subcontractors.

Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to access these services and functionality (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose.

You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
When you shop in a foreign store (meaning a store located outside of the UK/EEA area) that has an agreement with another company within the Klarna Group, the disclosure of your personal information between Klarna companies is required in order for the two Klarna companies to manage your payment and enable the foreign store to administer your purchase. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract (Article 6 (1)(b) UK GDPR).

Purpose and legal basis
: Personal data is shared with the authority when we are required by law to do so, or in some cases if you have asked us to do so, or if required to manage tax deductions or counter crime. An example of a legal obligation to provide information is when it is necessary to take measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. Depending on the authority and purpose, the legal bases are the obligation to comply with the law (Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR), to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR), or Klarna’s legitimate interest in protecting itself from crime (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).
There is also a requirement under UK law to withhold tax due on the payments.

Purpose and legal basis
: Klarna has a legitimate interest in being able to perform these transactions (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).

You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.2 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your personal information when you use Klarna’s payment methods, Klarna at a store, or choose to pay by debit or credit card in Klarna’s check-out at a store.

The store’s privacy notice applies to the processing of your personal data that has been shared with the store and that the store processes. Normally, you will find a link to the store’s privacy notice on the store’s website. The legal basis for sharing data with stores is partly the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR) insofar as the data sharing takes place to perform the contract between you and the store, and partly based on Klarna’s and the store’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR) or your consent (Article 6(1)(a) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose.

Purpose and legal basis
: Some stores use payment service providers and check-out providers with whom they share your information for managing your payment and purchase. This sharing takes place in accordance with the stores’ or the checkout providers’ own privacy notices. The store may also let Klarna share your information with the payment service provider they use for processing your payment. Some payment service providers also receive your information from Klarna, or collect and use your information independently, in accordance with their own privacy notices or to prevent fraud.

In addition, Klarna may share your information with your card network and with other financial institutions when managing your payment method or conducting transactions with your account to complete the transactions.

We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights. You can also contact the entities listed in the link above, to exercise the same rights as stated in

below.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.

section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.3 Categories of recipients with whom Klarna shares your data when you use one of Klarna’s payment methods involving the provision of credit or when you use the Klarna card, pay with Instore, pay with Klarna through digital wallets, or the One-time Card Shopping Service.
7.3.1 Credit information bureaus.
Description of the recipient:
If you apply to use a service from Klarna that involves us providing credit (see section 4.3 on which services from Klarna involve credit), we will share your personal data with credit information bureaus. Sharing does not take place in the event of small amounts or where we already have sufficient information.
Purpose and legal basis:
Your personal information is shared with credit bureaus in order to assess your creditworthiness, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud. This data sharing constitutes a credit report.
If you apply to use a credit Service (see Section 4.1 above for a specification of our credit Services), your personal data may be shared with Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) to assess your creditworthiness in connection with your application, to confirm your identity and your contact information, and to protect you and other customers from fraud.
For Klarna card, Pay Later in 30 days or Pay in 3 instalments, this sharing constitutes
soft credit searches
(or “soft credit lookups”) which does not affect your credit file nor credit score. The search is only visible to you and Klarna. In order to perform these credit searches, Klarna will send the CRAs your name, address, date of birth, phone number, as well as bank account number and sort code if relevant, in order to receive the lookups on you.
However, if you apply for one of our Financing products (fixed term loans or revolving account),
a hard credit search
(or “a hard credit lookup”) is performed in addition to soft searches. This is due to our Financing products constituting regulated credit products under UK credit legislation. This hard credit search will be recorded on your credit file and may impact your credit score as follows:
The CRA will keep a record of our enquiry against your name and which may be linked to your representatives (“associated records”). For the purposes of any application for Services from us, you may be assessed with reference to “associated records”. Where any search or application is completed, or agreement entered into, involving joint parties, we may record details about this at the CRAs. As a result an “association” will be created that will link your financial records.
Details of which CRA we have used for a specific search are available on request.
In addition, if you open an agreement with one of our Financing products, Klarna Card, Pay Later in 30 Days or Pay in 3 instalments, we will share further information on your agreement with the CRAs. This will occur on a monthly basis until the agreement is closed. This will include details of your outstanding balance, payments made and any default or failure to meet the terms of your agreement. These records will remain on the CRAs’ files for 6 years after our agreement with you is settled or terminated, whether settled by you or, if applicable, your business or by way of default. This and other information about you (or, if applicable, your business and those with whom you are linked financially) may be used to make credit decisions about you in the future.
The ways in which CRAs use and share personal data are explained in more detail at;
https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain
and
https://www.experian.co.uk/crain
. The CRAs will process your information in accordance with their own privacy notices and you can find out which ones we cooperate with
here
.
Klarna shares your information based on Klarna’s legitimate interest in conducting its business (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR), as the credit information bureaus have information on your financial standing which is important for Klarna to use as input to ensure a correct credit assessment, and not grant credit to consumers who is unable to repay it. We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights. You can also contact the entities listed in the link above, to exercise the same rights as stated in

Purpose and legal basis:
This data is shared to collect your overdue debts.

This data is shared based on our legitimate interest in collecting and selling debt (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR).

section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.3.3 VISA and digital wallet suppliers.
Description of the recipient:
We share information about you and your purchases when you use the Klarna card with VISA and with members of VISA’s card network. If you add yourKlarna card or an Instore card to your digital wallet or choose to pay with Klarna through your digital wallet, we may need to share your information with the supplier of that wallet.

If you renew your Klarna card or receive a new Klarna card, we will transfer this information to VISA so that VISA can inform third parties with whom you have previously chosen to save your Klarna card information (for example, for recurring transactions). Sharing is performed to fulfil the agreement with you (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR).
7.3.4 Debt acquirers (for open debts).
Description of the recipient:
Klarna can transfer your open debt to debt acquirers.
Purpose and legal basis:
Upon transfer of your debt to an acquirer and continuously until you pay off the debt, Klarna will share your contact and identification information (name, date of birth, social security number, address, and phone number), information about your financial standing (such as residual credit, repayments and any negative payment history in relation to the current debt), as well as information about the goods or services associated with the debt. The buyer will process your personal data in accordance with its own privacy notice, which you will receive information about when the debt is transferred.
The sharing of personal data with different acquirers is based on our legitimate interest in selling outstanding debts as part of our business operations (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your personal data processed for this purpose.
You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
7.4 Categories of recipients when using Klarna accounts services (Klarna balance, savings, and payment accounts).

7.5.1 Affiliate Networks.
Description of the recipient:
When you choose to click on a sponsored link or make a purchase on a cashback offer in the Klarna mobile application or on our website that links to a store, product or service, you will be redirected to another company’s website through a third party, known as an affiliate network.
Here
you can learn which affiliate networks Klarna cooperates with (presented in the left column). The affiliate networks will process your device information in accordance with their own privacy notices (you will find these privacy notices in the right column in the same
link
as referenced above). The store you visit through a sponsored link determines which affiliate network processes your information. Usually a store only cooperates with one affiliate network. You can get more information about which network by contacting us (or the store).
Purpose and legal basis:
The affiliate network may place tracking technology on your device that contains information about you clicking on that link in the Klarna mobile application, and which is then used to document your visit to the store to calculate a potential commission due to Klarna.
This processing is based on a balancing of interests (Article 6(1)(f) UK GDPR). When balancing interests, Klarna has determined that we have a legitimate interest in supplying you with sponsored links in order to market shops in the Klarna mobile application and on our website. We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose.
You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in your particular case. See
section 2
for more information about your rights.
In addition, we need to share information with our affiliate networks to determine your eligibility for cashback under the Klarna Cashback programme. This includes confirming that you have met the specified criteria established in our cashback offers. The data shared also serves to determine the cashback amount potentially due to you.
The processing for our cashback service is based on the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).

privacy policy
. We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that our interest outweighs your right not to have your information processed for this purpose.

8. When can we transfer your personal data outside of the UK and the EEA, and how do we protect it then?
We always strive to process your personal data within the UK or EEA area. But in certain situations, such as when we share your information within the Klarna Group or with a supplier, subcontractor or store which operates outside the UK/EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the UK/EEA. Klarna always ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the UK GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. Your rights in respect to your personal data (described in detail in
section 2
), are not affected when data is transferred outside of the UK/EEA. More information about the recipients Klarna shares your data with you can find in
section 7
.
When you shop with a store placed in a country outside of the UK/EEA area, our sharing of your personal data with that store means that your personal data will be transferred to this country outside of the UK/EEA area.
Certain suppliers of Klarna use Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) when they transfer personal data outside of the UK/EEA area within their own company group. Such BCR have been approved by an EU or UK data protection authority and ensures that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data when it is transferred.
If you want more information about our safety measures you can always contact us. You can find our contact information in
section 12
. You find more information about which countries are deemed to have an “adequate level of protection” on the
European Commission’s website
, and you can read more about the European Commission’s standard clauses
here
, and about binding corporate rules (“BCR”)
here
. The Information Commissioner's Office has information about data transfers
here
.
Safety measures which Klarna uses when transferring personal data outside of the UK/EEA
Countries outside of the UK/EEA may have laws that allow public authorities to request access to personal data stored in the country for the purpose of combating crime or safeguarding national security. Regardless of whether we or any of our providers process your personal data, we will ensure that a high level of protection is guaranteed when transferring that data and that appropriate protection measures have been taken, in accordance with applicable data protection requirements (such as the UK GDPR). Such appropriate safeguards include, but are not limited to, ensuring:
if the European Commission or UK authority has decided that the country outside of the UK/EEA to which your personal data are transferred has an adequate level of protection, which corresponds to the level of protection afforded by the UK GDPR. This means for example that the personal data is still protected from unauthorized disclosure, and that you may still exercise your rights in regards to your personal data, or
the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) have been entered into between Klarna and the recipient of the personal data outside the UK/EEA. This means that the recipient guarantees that the level of protection for your personal data afforded by the UK GDPR still applies, and that your rights are still protected. In these cases, we also assess whether there are laws in the recipient country that affects the protection of your personal data. Where necessary, we take technical and organizational measures so that your data remain protected during the transfer to the relevant country outside the UK/EEA, or
that the transfer is covered by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, with the UK extension. This is an opt-in certification scheme for US companies, administered by the US Department of Commerce. This Privacy Framework includes a set of enforceable principles and requirements that must be certified to by the US company, ensuring that your data is still being sufficiently protected.
Despite the above, if the store where you choose to shop is located in a country outside the UK/EEA, our data sharing with that store (and with the Klarna entity that store has contracted with) means that your personal data will be transferred to and processed in this country outside the UK/EEA. Click
here
to access the privacy notices for other Klarna entities in the Klarna Group. Otherwise it would not be possible to administer your purchase. Klarna primarily relies on the European Commission’s standard clauses (with required UK addendums) to ensure the protection of your personal data for such data transfers, but as set out above, countries where the foreign store is located may have laws preventing the efficient protection by the standard clauses. Even if this is the case, your personal data will still be transferred to the foreign store (or the foreign store’s local Klarna entity), as long as the data transfer is necessary to administer your specific purchase.
9. How long we store your personal data
How long Klarna stores your personal data depends on the purposes for which Klarna uses the personal data:
Personal data used for the contractual relationship between you and Klarna is generally stored for the duration of the contractual relationship and thereafter for a maximum of up to 10 years based on statutes of limitations rules.
Personal data that Klarna is under a legal obligation to retain, for example under anti-money laundering laws or bookkeeping laws, is generally retained for 5 and 7 years respectively.
We process the recordings of telephone conversations for a time period of 90 days for quality assurance purposes. We will also retain recordings of inbound and outbound calls for up to three years, as well as Klarna employees’ notations from these calls for up to six years, in order to document what has been discussed and decided on the call.
Personal data which is not used for the purposes of your contractual relationship with Klarna or where Klarna does not have a legal obligation to retain the data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfil the respective purpose for our data processing (usually 3 months). More information can be found in the table in
section 4
.
In some limited cases, the personal data may need to be stored for a longer period because of capital adequacy laws which Klarna has to comply with.
The legal obligations referred to above means that Klarna cannot delete your personal data, even if you request us to delete it, as described in
section 2
. If we don’t have a legal obligation to retain the personal data, we instead have to make an assessment if we may require the personal data in order to protect Klarna from legal claims.
Please note that just because we have a legal obligation to store your personal data, this does not mean that we are also permitted to use this data for any other purpose. Klarna will make an assessment for each specific purpose of how long we may use your personal data. You can read more about this in
section 4
.
10. How we use cookies and other types of tracking technology
To provide a tailored and smoooth experience, Klarna uses cookies and similar tracking technologies in our multiple interfaces, such as our website, the Klarna mobile application and at the checkout of a store that uses Klarna. You can find information about the tracking technology that Klarna uses, and information about how you accept or decline the tracking technology, in each interface.
11. Updates to this Privacy Notice
We are constantly working to improve our services so that you have a smoooth user experience. This may involve modifications of existing and future services. If that improvement requires a notice or consent in accordance with applicable law, you will be notified or given the opportunity to give your consent. It is also important that you read this privacy notice every time you use any of our services, as the processing of your personal data may differ from your previous use of the service in question.

6. Unter welchen Umständen geben wir personenbezogene Daten weiter
Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte weiter, wenn eine Rechtsgrundlage dafür besteht.
Dies umfasst:
Andere PayPal-Unternehmen
, um Ihnen die Dienste bereitzustellen, sowie in unserem berechtigten Interesse an der Ausübung unserer Geschäftstätigkeit. Diese Interessen werden in Abschnitt 5 (
Welche personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden und auf welchen Rechtsgrundlagen dies beruht
)
näher erläutert. Das PayPal-Unternehmen, das Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhält, verarbeitet diese in Einklang mit dieser Datenschutzerklärung.
Behörden
, soweit wir rechtlich dazu verpflichtet sind. Dazu zählen Steuerbehörden, Polizeibehörden, Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Aufsichtsbehörden in den jeweils maßgeblichen Ländern. Wir können auch verpflichtet sein, zuständigen Behörden, wie beispielsweise den Finanzbehörden, Informationen über Ihre Nutzung unserer Dienste zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dies kann Ihren Namen, Ihre Adresse und Informationen zu Kartentransaktionen umfassen, die wir in Ihrem Auftrag über unsere Dienste abwickeln. Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Einhaltung von Offenlegungspflichten, die sich aus dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten ergeben, ist die bestehende rechtliche Verpflichtung. Soweit die Offenlegung nicht auf dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten beruht, ist die Rechtsgrundlage unser berechtigtes Interesse und die Einhaltung geltender Vorschriften zur Verhinderung widerrechtlichen Verhaltens.
Andere Finanzinstitute und Kartennetzwerke
, um die Zahlungsabwicklung zu erleichtern, gemeinsam ein Produkt anzubieten oder Karten Ihrer E-Börse hinzuzufügen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Offenlegung ist die Erfüllung des zwischen Ihnen und uns bestehenden Vertrags. Die betreffenden Parteien können auch für andere berechtigte Zwecke auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zugreifen, wie etwa Identitätsprüfung, Betrugsprävention und Risikomanagement. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrügerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
Betrugsbekämpfungs- und Identitätsprüfungsbehörden
, zum Beispiel, um uns bei der Erkennung von Aktivitäten zu unterstützen, die auf Betrug hindeuten. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrügerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
Inkassobüros
, beispielsweise um unbezahlte überfällige Forderungen durch Dritte wie ein Inkassobüro einzuziehen. Wir tun dies auf der Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses, Geschäfte zu tätigen und Schulden einzutreiben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Datenschutzerklärung dieser Parteien für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten gilt, die Sie ihnen direkt mitteilen, und dass sie Ihre unbezahlten Schulden Kreditauskunfteien melden können, was Ihre Kreditwürdigkeit oder Ihre Fähigkeit zur Sicherung zukünftiger Kredite beeinträchtigen kann.
Dienstanbieter
, die in unserem Auftrag und nach unseren Weisungen Dienstleistungen erbringen, die wir an sie ausgelagert haben, wie z.B. Marketing, IT-Entwicklung, Wartung, Hosting und Support sowie Kundenserviceleistungen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist die Erfüllung unserer gegenüber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten.
Andere Nutzer, soweit dies ausweislich Ihrer Kontoeinstellungen zulässig ist
. Über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen können Sie anderen Nutzern bestimmte Informationen wie Ihr Profilfoto, Ihren Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihren Benutzernamen oder Ihren Wohnort anzeigen oder zugänglich machen. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist Ihre Einwilligung. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie Ihre Profileinstellungen jederzeit und kostenfrei ändern können.
Finanzinstitute in Verbindung mit Ihrer Teilnahme an Open Banking
, z.B. wenn Sie eine Kontoverbindung mit einer anderen Bank, einem Kartenkonto oder einem Aggregator einleiten. Wir prüfen daher, ob Sie über genügend Geld verfügen, oder bestätigen, dass Sie der Inhaber des Kontos sind. Wenn Sie Ihr Konto verknüpfen, ist die Rechtsgrundlage für den Zugriff auf Ihre Kontodaten die Erfüllung unserer vertraglichen Verpflichtungen gegenüber Ihnen.
Partner und Händler, deren Dienstanbieter und sonstige Transaktionsbeteiligte
. Wenn Sie beispielsweise die Dienste nutzen, um Online-Einkäufe zu tätigen, Zahlungen an andere Nutzer vorzunehmen oder Waren zurückzugeben, können wir Informationen über Sie und Ihr Konto an die anderen Parteien weitergeben, die an der Abwicklung Ihrer Transaktionen beteiligt sind. Die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung ist die Erfüllung unserer gegenüber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten sowie unser berechtigtes Interesse. Bitte beachten Sie, dass für personenbezogene Daten, die an Partner und Händler (oder deren Dienstanbieter) weitergegeben werden, welche an einer Transaktion beteiligt sind, die eigenen Datenschutzerklärungen und Verfahren der Partner und Händler gelten.
Externe, unabhängige Datenverantwortliche
, wenn wir beispielsweise personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien, Erwerber und andere Finanzinstitute weitergeben oder an Sicherheitsprodukte, um zu verhindern, dass Bots auf unsere Dienste zugreifen können.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie direkt an diese Parteien weitergeben, deren Datenschutzerklärungen gelten
. So verwenden wir beispielsweise reCAPTCHA von Google, um Missbrauch unserer Dienste zu verhindern, wenn Sie auf unsere PayPal-App zugreifen. Die
Datenschutzerklärung
und die
Nutzungsbedingungen
von Google gelten für die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie an Google weitergeben. Weitere Informationen zu Kreditauskunfteien, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, um Ihre Kreditwürdigkeit zu bewerten, finden Sie in Abschnitt 12 (
Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
).
Käufer oder sonstige Weitergabe in Verbindung mit einer Geschäftsübertragung
. Wenn wir beispielsweise ein Geschäft oder Vermögenswerte veräußern, können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an einen Käufer dieses Geschäfts oder dieser Vermögenswerte weitergeben. Ebenso können personenbezogene Daten weitergegeben werden, wenn PayPal oder ein wesentlicher Teil des PayPal-Vermögens von einer dritten Partei erworben wird. PayPal hat ein berechtigtes Interesse daran, derartige Transaktionen durchführen zu können.
7. Wie lange Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von PayPal gespeichert werden
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange, wie es im Rahmen des Zwecks, für den sie erhoben wurden, und in Übereinstimmung mit dem geltenden Recht benötigt oder zulässig ist.
Die Kriterien für die Bestimmung der Aufbewahrungsfrist lauten:
Personenbezogene Daten, die für die laufende Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und PayPal genutzt werden, werden für die Dauer der Beziehung zuzüglich eines Zeitraums von zehn Jahren gespeichert
Personenbezogene Daten in Bezug auf eine rechtliche Verpflichtung, der wir unterliegen, werden im Einklang mit geltendem Recht aufbewahrt, wie z.B. gemäß geltendem Insolvenzrecht und AML-Verpflichtungen.
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange wie nötig, wenn die Aufbewahrung angesichts von Rechtsstreitigkeiten, Ermittlungen, Audit- und Compliance-Praktiken oder zum Schutz vor Rechtsansprüchen ratsam ist.
8. Internationale Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten
Da wir in zahlreichen Ländern tätig sind, kann es vorkommen, dass wir (oder unsere Dienstanbieter) Ihre Daten außerhalb des Landes, in dem Sie leben, übermitteln und verarbeiten. Um Ihre Daten in den Vereinigten Staaten und anderen Ländern zu verarbeiten und zu speichern, setzen wir externe Dienstanbieter ein. In den betreffenden Ländern ist nicht immer ein gleichwertiger Datenschutz gegeben. Wir haben daher konkrete Maßnahmen in Übereinstimmung mit dem Datenschutzrecht der EU und Großbritanniens getroffen, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen. Bei der Übermittlung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zwischen PayPal-Unternehmen stützen wir uns auf von den zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörden genehmigte bindende Unternehmensregeln (abrufbar
hier
). Andere Übermittlungen erfolgen auf der Grundlage von Standardvertragsklauseln, die von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigt wurden, damit gewährleistet ist, dass Ihre Daten einen hohen Schutzstandard genießen und Ihre Datenschutzrechte gewahrt bleiben.

Ihr Recht, den automatisierten Entscheidungen und der Profilerstellung zu widersprechen
Falls Sie im Rahmen der unten beschriebenen automatisierten Entscheidungen nicht zugelassen sind, haben Sie keinen Zugang zu unseren Dienstleistungen, wie beispielsweise unseren Zahlungsmethoden. PayPal verfügt über verschiedene Sicherheitsmechanismen, um die Angemessenheit der Entscheidungen zu gewährleisten. Zu diesen Mechanismen gehören laufende Überprüfungen unserer Entscheidungsmodelle und fallweise Stichproben. Wenn Sie bezüglich des Ergebnisses Bedenken haben, können Sie uns
kontaktieren
. Wir werden dann überprüfen, ob das Verfahren korrekt durchgeführt wurde.
Sie haben das Recht, einer automatisierten Entscheidung zu widersprechen, wenn deren Rechtsfolgen oder Ergebnisse geeignet sind, (zusammen mit dem entsprechenden Profiling) in sonstiger Weise erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Sie zu haben, indem Sie uns
kontaktieren
. Wir prüfen die Entscheidung sodann unter Berücksichtigung der zusätzlichen Umstände.

Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten mit Ihrer Zustimmung verwenden, haben Sie im Allgemeinen das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen, ohne die Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung aufgrund der Zustimmung vor ihrem Widerruf zu beeinträchtigen.
Die Rechtmäßigkeit einer Verarbeitung, die vor Ihrem Widerruf stattgefunden hat, wird durch den Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung nicht berührt. Das gleiche gilt für die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten auf der Grundlage eines anderen Rechtsgrundes als Ihrer Einwilligung.
Widerspruchsrecht gegen Direktmarketing
Sofern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für Direktmarketingzwecke verwenden, können Sie jederzeit Ihre Berechtigungseinstellungen ändern, widersprechen und sich über den Abmeldelink in elektronischen Mitteilungen bzw. über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen von zukünftigen Direktmarketingnachrichten abmelden.

Welche personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden und auf welchen Rechtsgrundlagen dies beruht
)
Wie nehmen Sie Ihre Rechte wahr, und wie können Sie uns oder die Datenschutzbehörde kontaktieren?

11. Nähere Informationen zu automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung und Profiling
"
Automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung
" ist der Prozess der vollautomatischen Entscheidungsfindung ohne menschliche Beteiligung. In einigen Fällen könnten diese Entscheidungen
rechtliche oder ähnlich erhebliche Auswirkungen
auf Sie als natürliche Person haben. "
Profiling
" bezeichnet Analysen der Persönlichkeit, des Verhaltens, des Interesses und der Gewohnheiten einer Person, um Vorhersagen oder Entscheidungen über sie zu treffen. Soweit dies nach dem Recht der EU oder der Mitgliedstaaten zulässig oder für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags erforderlich ist, können wir in einigen Fällen automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling für Entscheidungen verwenden. Ein Beispiel für unseren Einsatz automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung ist die Bewertung Ihrer Kreditwürdigkeit, um Ihre Eignung für bestimmte Kreditprodukte zu beurteilen.
Wir glauben, dass PayPal durch das automatische Treffen solcher Entscheidungen seine Objektivität und Transparenz bei der Entscheidung, welche Dienste Ihnen angeboten werden, erhöht. Wir setzen mehrere Sicherheitsmechanismen ein, um sicherzustellen, dass die Entscheidungen angemessen sind. Zu diesen Mechanismen gehören laufende Übersichten unserer Entscheidungsmodelle und Stichproben im Einzelfall. Sie können stattdessen jederzeit eine manuelle Entscheidungsfindung verlangen, Ihre Meinung äußern oder eine Entscheidungsfindung anfechten, die ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung, einschließlich Profiling, beruht, wenn eine solche Entscheidung
rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder Sie in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigt
. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie Sie diesen Entscheidungen widersprechen können, finden Sie in Abschnitt 10
("Ihre Datenschutzrechte")
.

an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten, wenn Sie mehr über die Nutzung von automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling erfahren möchten.
12. Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
Haben Sie einen Kredit beantragt oder nutzen Sie unsere Kreditdienste, können wir zur Bearbeitung Ihres Antrags Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben, die uns Informationen über Sie geben, wie z.B. Ihre Finanzhistorie. Dies geschieht, um Kreditwürdigkeit und Produkteignung zu beurteilen, Ihre Identität zu überprüfen, offene Forderungen zu ermitteln und einzuziehen sowie kriminelle Handlungen zu verhindern.
Die Rechtsgrundlagen für diese Übermittlungen finden sich in Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b (vertraglich) und Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f (berechtigtes Interesse) der EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung ("EU-DSGVO").
Wir werden auch weiterhin laufend Informationen über Sie mit Kreditauskunfteien austauschen, einschließlich über Ihre beglichenen Konten und alle Schulden, die nicht rechtzeitig vollständig zurückgezahlt wurden. Diese Informationen können von CRAs an andere Organisationen weitergegeben werden, um ähnliche Überprüfungen durchzuführen und Ihren Aufenthaltsort zu ermitteln und Schulden einzutreiben.
Ihre Daten werden auch mit den Daten aller gemeinsamen Bewerber oder anderer Finanzpartner verknüpft.
So erfahren Sie mehr
Wenden Sie sich

Sie können sich an die Kreditauskunfteien, die im Land Ihres Wohnsitzes tätig sind, direkt wenden, wenn Sie Fragen zu deren Dienstleistungen, Ihrem Kreditscore oder zu den über Sie gespeicherten Daten haben. Das gleiche gilt, wenn Sie gegenüber den Kreditauskunfteien Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person ausüben möchten.

Wir sorgen für die Sicherung unserer Systeme und Dienste. Für die Sicherheit und die Geheimhaltung Ihres Passworts bzw. Ihrer Passwörter und Ihres Kontoprofils bzw. Ihrer Anmeldedaten sind Sie jedoch selbst verantwortlich. Darüber hinaus liegt es in Ihrer Verantwortung zu prüfen, dass die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir über Sie besitzen, richtig und auf dem aktuellen Stand sind.

15. Aktualisierungen dieser Datenschutzerklärung
Diese Datenschutzerklärung wird von Zeit zu Zeit überarbeitet, um Änderungen an unserer Geschäftstätigkeit, unseren Diensten oder den geltenden Gesetzen Rechnung zu tragen.

AGB-Aktualisierungen
oder der Seite
Datenschutzerklärung
. Andernfalls wird die überarbeitete Datenschutzerklärung ab dem angegebenen Startdatum wirksam.
16. Hinweis zu Bankvorschriften für Nutzer im EWR und in Großbritannien
In der Regel verlangt das luxemburgische Recht, dem PayPal (in Bezug auf Datenschutz und Bankgeheimnis) unterliegt, einen höheren Grad an Transparenz als die meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen in der EU. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Anbietern von Internet- oder Finanzdienstleistungen in der EU listen wir daher in dieser Datenschutzerklärung die Drittanbieter und Geschäftspartner, die Dienstleistungen für uns erbringen und denen gegenüber wir Ihre Daten offenlegen, sowie den Zweck der Offenlegung und die Art der offengelegten Daten auf. Einen Link zu diesen Drittanbietern finden Sie
hier
. Dadurch, dass Sie diese Datenschutzerklärung annehmen und ein Konto bei PayPal haben, willigen Sie ausdrücklich in die Übermittlung Ihrer Daten an diese Drittanbieter für die aufgeführten Zwecke ein.
PayPal kann die oben genannte Drittanbieterliste am ersten Werktag eines jeden Quartals (d.h. im Januar, April, Juli und Oktober) aktualisieren. PayPal beginnt erst 30 Tage nach dem Datum der Veröffentlichung der Liste innerhalb der Datenschutzerklärung mit der Übermittlung von Daten an eines der in der jeweiligen Aktualisierung neu aufgeführten Unternehmen oder für die dort neu aufgeführten Zwecke oder Datentypen. Sie sollten sich in jedem Quartal zu den oben genannten Terminen auf der PayPal-Website erneut mit der Liste vertraut machen. Wenn Sie der neuen Form der Datenübertragung nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Veröffentlichung der aktualisierten Drittanbieterliste widersprechen, gelten die Änderungen der Liste und dieser Datenschutzerklärung als von Ihnen angenommen. Sind Sie mit den Änderungen nicht einverstanden, steht es Ihnen frei, Ihr Konto zu schließen und unsere Dienste nicht mehr zu nutzen.
Um die PayPal-Dienste bereitstellen zu können, müssen wir möglicherweise bestimmte Daten, die wir (wie in dieser Datenschutzerklärung dargelegt) erhoben haben, an andere mit PayPal verbundene Unternehmen oder sonstige Stellen übermitteln, einschließlich solcher, die gemäß diesem Abschnitt eine Funktion als Zahlungsdienstleister, Zahlungsanbieter oder Kontoinhaber (oder ähnliche Funktionen) erfüllen. Sie erkennen an, dass diese Stellen in ihren jeweiligen Rechtsordnungen Gesetzen, Vorschriften, Untersuchungen, Ermittlungen oder Anordnungen unterworfen sein können, durch die sie zur Weitergabe von Daten an die zuständigen Behörden des betreffenden Landes verpflichtet sind. Durch die Nutzung der PayPal-Dienste willigen Sie in die Übermittlung solcher Daten durch uns zum Zweck der Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie ein.
Insbesondere stimmen Sie allen folgenden Datenverarbeitungsmaßnahmen zu und weisen PayPal an, diese vorzunehmen:
a. Offenlegung notwendiger Informationen gegenüber der Polizei und anderen Strafverfolgungsbehörden, Sicherheitskräften, zuständigen staatlichen, zwischenstaatlichen oder überstaatlichen Stellen, zuständigen Behörden, Abteilungen, Aufsichtsbehörden, Selbstregulierungsbehörden oder -organisationen (einschließlich der
hier
im Abschnitt "Behörden" der Drittanbieterliste genannten Stellen) und anderen Dritten, einschließlich Unternehmen der PayPal-Gruppe, (i) deren Weisungen wir gesetzlich verpflichtet und befugt sind, einzuhalten, unter anderem aufgrund der luxemburgischen Gesetze vom 24. Juli 2015 über das US-amerikanische Gesetz zur Einhaltung der Steuervorschriften für Auslandskonten ("FATCA-Gesetz") und vom 18. Dezember 2015 über die einvernehmlich festgelegten Standards für die Berichterstattung der OECD ("CRS-Gesetz"), (ii) bei denen wir Grund zu der Annahme haben, dass die Kooperation mit ihnen bei der Untersuchung von Betrugsfällen oder sonstigen tatsächlichen oder mutmaßlichen widerrechtlichen Aktivitäten geboten ist, oder (iii) zur Ermittlung von Verstößen gegen unsere Nutzungsbedingungen (dies gilt auch für Ihre Zahlungsquelle oder Ihren Kredit- oder Debitkartenanbieter).
Wenn Sie in den Geltungsbereich des FATCA- oder des CRS-Gesetzes fallen, sind wir dazu verpflichtet, Sie über die Weitergabe von Daten an die jeweiligen Behörden zu unterrichten. Informieren Sie sich über die Verpflichtungen von PayPal nach dem FATCA- und dem CRS-Gesetz sowie darüber, welche Auswirkungen diese Verpflichtungen für Sie haben können und welche Informationen wir gegebenenfalls im Zuge dieser Verpflichtungen weitergeben.
Wir und weitere Organisationen, einschließlich von Unternehmen, die Zahlungen über PayPal akzeptieren, können notwendige Daten (darunter auch Daten, die von Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen aufgezeichnet wurden, und Daten aus anderen Ländern) zum Zwecke der Bewertung und Verwaltung von Risiken (wie z.B. zur Verhinderung von Betrug, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung) weitergeben, nutzen und auf sie zugreifen. Bitte wenden Sie sich an uns, wenn Sie weitere Informationen über die jeweiligen Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen wünschen. Klicken Sie
hier
, um weitere Informationen zu diesen Behörden, den Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen und sonstigen Dritten zu erhalten.
b. Offenlegung von Kontoinformationen gegenüber Inhabern von geistigem Eigentum, wenn diese nach dem maßgeblichen nationalen Recht eines EU-Mitgliedstaates einen außergerichtlichen Auskunftsanspruch gegen PayPal aufgrund einer Verletzung ihrer geistigen Eigentumsrechte haben, bei der PayPal-Dienste genutzt wurden (zum Beispiel § 19, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Markengesetzes oder § 101, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Urheberrechtsgesetzes).
c. Obligatorische Offenlegung aufgrund von Kreditkartenbestimmungen oder in straf- oder zivilrechtlichen Verfahren.
d. Offenlegung Ihres Namens und PayPal-Links im PayPal-Benutzerverzeichnis. Ihre Daten werden anderen PayPal-Kunden angezeigt, wenn diese eine Suche anhand Ihres Namens, Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer oder eines Teils dieser Angaben durchführen. Dadurch soll sichergestellt werden, dass Zahlungen an den richtigen Empfänger erfolgen. Diese Funktion kann in den PayPal-Profileinstellungen deaktiviert werden.
e. Nutzen Sie als Händler einen Dritten für den Zugriff auf PayPal oder die Integration von PayPal, können wir notwendige Informationen an diesen Dritten zur Umsetzung und Verwaltung der betreffenden Vereinbarungen weitergeben (darunter den Status Ihrer PayPal-Integration, ob Sie ein aktives PayPal-Konto haben und ob Sie bereits mit einem anderen PayPal-Integrationspartner arbeiten).
f. Offenlegung notwendiger Daten gegenüber Zahlungsanbietern, Wirtschaftsprüfern, Kundenservice-Anbietern, Kreditauskunfteien und Betrugsbekämpfungsstellen, Anbietern von Finanzprodukten, Handelspartnern, Marketing- und PR-Unternehmen, Anbietern von operativen Dienstleistungen, Konzerngesellschaften, Agenturen, Marktplätzen und sonstigen Dritten, die
hier
aufgeführt sind. Zweck der Offenlegung ist die Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie. In der Drittanbieterliste haben wir außerdem unter jeder Kategorie nicht abschließende Beispiele von Drittanbietern (einschließlich deren Abtretungsempfängern und Rechtsnachfolgern) aufgeführt, gegenüber denen eine Offenlegung Ihrer Kontoinformationen derzeit tatsächlich stattfindet oder in Betracht gezogen werden kann. Neben dem Zweck der Offenlegung haben wir auch die offengelegten Informationen angegeben (soweit nicht anders angegeben, ist es diesen Drittanbietern gesetzlich bzw. vertraglich untersagt, die Informationen für einen anderen als den vorgesehenen Zweck zu nutzen).
g. Offenlegung erforderlicher Daten gegenüber Ihren Vertretern bzw. Verfahrensbevollmächtigten (z.B. dem Inhaber einer von Ihnen erteilten Vollmacht oder einem für Sie bestellten Vormund).
h. Offenlegung von zusammengefassten Statistikdaten an unsere Geschäftspartner oder PR-Partner. Wir können beispielsweise offenlegen, dass ein bestimmter Prozentsatz unserer Kunden in einer bestimmten Stadt lebt. Diese zusammengefassten Daten enthalten keine personenbezogenen Daten.

hier
aufgeführte) Drittanbieter zu folgenden Zwecken:
Betrugsprävention und Risikosteuerung: Prävention von Betrug sowie Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken.
Kundenservice: zu Zwecken des Kundenservice, einschließlich der Betreuung Ihrer Konten oder zur Klärung von Konflikten (z.B. in Bezug auf Rechnungen oder Transaktionen).

For questions regarding our privacy policy or practices, contact SurveyMonkey electronically through
this form
. If you feel your question has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may
contact BBB
, which operates an independent dispute resolution mechanism.
This privacy statement is split into two sections: one for
Form Creators
, and one for
Form Respondents
.
Privacy For Form Creators
1. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
Registration information.
You need a Wufoo account before you can create forms on Wufoo. When you register for an account, we collect your username, email address and password. We also collect your name if you supply it in the account management section. Some Wufoo account plans permit you to create accounts for other Form Creators under your own account. When you create accounts for these additional Form Creators, we collect their name and email address.
Form data.
We store your form data (form content and responses) for you.
2. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?
We use the information we collect in accordance with
SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy
for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo). We would like to emphasize that we will not use your form data to compete with you, market to your clients, or contact them for any other means of profit. We will not sell your form data.
3. With whom do we share or disclose your information?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with
SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy
for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo).
4. What are your rights to your information?
You can:
Update your account details.
You can update your registration and other account information on your account management page. Information is updated immediately.
Download/backup your form data.
We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your form data in a variety of formats. This allows you to create your own backups or work with your data offline.
See here for data exporting instructions
.
Delete your form data.
You can delete your form data (including parts of forms, entire forms and responses to forms) through your account’s user interface.
See here for how to delete form entries
.
Cancel your Wufoo account.
You can cancel your Wufoo account at any time through your account management page. Any cancellation of your Wufoo account will result in the deletion of your account and all form data stored in it. This data cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled. Please be aware that SurveyMonkey may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database which takes up to about 12 months to disappear.
5. Security, cookies and other important information
Security.
Each Form Creator is assigned a unique username and password which is required to access their Wufoo account. It is each Form Creator’s responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information. Regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a risk that your personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting and transmitting your data over the internet.
Cookies.
See SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy for general information about cookies.

for information on specific cookies used by Wufoo.
Changes to this privacy statement.
This privacy statement may be changed in the same manner as changes that are made to SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy.
Online tracking.
We currently do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit the Wufoo website or use the Wufoo services.
Privacy For Form Respondents
1. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
Responses to forms.
We collect and store the responses that you submit to forms. Form Creators are responsible for this data and manage it. A form may ask you to provide personal information or data. If you have any questions about a form you are completing, please contact the Form Creator who created the form directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that form. The creator of the form is usually the same person that invited you to complete the form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy. SurveyMonkey is not liable for any actions or inactions a Form Creator takes with respect to any data or information that they may collect from a Form Respondent.
2. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with
SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy
for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).
3. With whom do we share or disclose your information?
We disclose the information we collect in accordance with
SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy
for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).
4. What are your rights to your information?
Contact the relevant Form Creator to access your responses.
Because we collect form responses on behalf of Form Creators, you will need to contact the Form Creator if you have any questions about the form, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses. We provide Form Creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through their forms. SurveyMonkey cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the Form Creator’s private information.
5. Security, cookies and other important information
See section 5 of the “Privacy for Form Creators” section above.

Want to know why Wufoo is the best online form builder? When you design a form with Wufoo, it automatically builds the database, backend, and scripts needed to make collecting and understanding your data easy, fast, and fun. Because we host everything, all you need is a browser, an Internet connection, and a few minutes to build a form and start using it right away. At Wufoo, we believe forms are the starting point for building anything useful on the web. Basically, they’re the most efficient mechanisms for collecting data from people. The problem is sometimes creating an online form isn’t very efficient. The process of creating a form and all the database structures and scripts necessary to make it work (not to mention useful) is a really tedious process that makes what should be a simple task (collecting and understanding information) not really worth the time, effort, or cost of the endeavor. The entire process could take you or your IT person days, if not weeks. With Wufoo, you can skip all the hard stuff (because it does it all for you) and start getting things done.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that
partner with Google

Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products

Delete your information
Inactive Account Manager
allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.
And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data
To delete your information, you can:
Delete your content from
specific Google services
Search for and then delete specific items from your account using
My Activity
Delete specific Google products
, including your information associated with those products
Delete your entire Google Account
Delete your information
Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.

Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

X Privacy Policy
Effective: November 15, 2024
Before you scroll, read this
It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared.
So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:
X is a public platform

10. How To Contact X
1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us.
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
Personal Accounts.
If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
Professional Accounts.
If you create a
professional account
, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.
Payment Information.
In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
Preferences.
When you set your preferences using your
settings
, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
Biometric Information.
Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.
Job Applications / Recommendations.
We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.
Usage Information.
We collect information about your activity on X, including:
Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to
Encrypted Messages
, and when you use
Direct Messages
, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.
We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).
Purchase and payments.
To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
Device Information.
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:
Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.
Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.
Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information.
When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.
Inferred Identity.
We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:
When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.
When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.
Log Information.
We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:

We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.
Advertisements.
When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites.
When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
When you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.
Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,
generates, or infers
about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.
We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our
corporate affiliates
, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.
2. How We Use Information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always
contact us
. Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover
affiliates
, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your
settings
, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2  Foster safety and security.
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity.

3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you post and share.
With the general public
. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your
settings
).
With other X users.
Depending on your
settings
, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:
Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.
Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
Direct Messages
. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
With partners.
Depending on your
settings
, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
Help Center
. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings
. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center
article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
With service providers.
We may share your information with our
service providers
that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers.
Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations.
We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
authorize a third-party web client or application
to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your
autoplay settings
if you prefer that content not to play automatically.
Third-party collaborators.
Depending on your
settings
, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.
Through our APIs.
We use technology like
APIs
and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have
standard terms
that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
https://developer.x.com
.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:
comply with a law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request
;
protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of
our Rules
);
address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.
We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our
affiliates
to provide our products and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
4. How Long We Keep Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.
We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.
We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.
If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
We generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies
here
.
We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.
We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:
To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
here
.
In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.
Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.
Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
here
.
5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account
settings
.
You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in
Your X Data
and request access to additional information
here
.
You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions
here
.
To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
If you follow the instructions
here
, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features
here
. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a
Space
is recorded, or whether
videos you upload
are downloadable by others.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.
6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing
. And no, we don’t sell your personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from us.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
our affiliates
and third-party partners and
service providers
located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on
standard contractual clauses
(SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
here
. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.
X is a
participant
in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us
here
. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body
JAMS
, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in
Annex 1
to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK.

Here we explain the legal bases we rely on when we process your information. This section also describes why we use your information, how this information is processed, the categories of information involved, and the associated rights (which always includes the right to access your information).

A Note to Users Outside of the United States. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding the processing of Personal Data may be less protective than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such processing and transfer.
Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data”
means data that, by itself, allows someone to identify or contact you as an individual, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.
“Anonymous Data”
means data that does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons and that is not associated with or linked to Personal Data. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
Information You Provide to Us.
We may collect your e-mail address and password when you create an account to log in to our network (“
Account
”).
When you subscribe to our Services, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, and billing information.
If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will collect your e-mail address.
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in your e-mail to us, in order to send you a reply.
We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Site or Services that state that Personal Data is being collected.
Information You Provide to Third Party Accounts.
If you sign in to your Account via Shopify or a third-party e-commerce platform provider (“
Third Party Account
”), you are allowing us to access information and content stored by the Third Party Account, including, without limitation, information relating to the products you sell in your online store, and you are agreeing to the Third Party Account’s terms of use in your use of the Services.

Information Collected via Technology.
Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Site, Application and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to:
The date and time of your visit and the web pages and content you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services;
Information about the type of content accessed via our Services;
The site you visited before and after visiting our Site;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with your browser online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
Search terms you enter using our Services or on a referral site;
Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers;
Information about your device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device; and
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).
Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.
“Cookies”
are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website or application. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site and Services.
Pixel Tags. In addition, we use
“Pixel Tags
” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages and e-mail messages. We may use Pixel Tags to collect information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails.
Do Not Track. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals from web browsers.
Analytics Services. We use third-party analytics services (“
Analytics Services
”), to help analyze how users use our Site, Application and Services. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site, Application and Services (the “
Analytics Information
”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at
team@tapcart.co
.
Information Collected from You About Others
.
If a customer purchases your products through a mobile application that was developed using our Services, we will collect information about such purchase, including name, email-address, and products purchased (“
Customer Data
”). We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to collect such information. You or the third party may contact us at team@tapcart.co to request the removal of this information from our database.
Use of Your Personal Data
General Use.
In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make or to aid us in serving you better. We and our authorized service providers may use your Personal Data in various ways, including to:
facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network;
identify you as a user in our system;
provide improved administration of our Site and Services;
provide the Services you request;
measure and analyze audience traffic and improve the quality of your experience when you interact with our Site and Services;
send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security, or support and maintenance advisories;
send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials and for other marketing purposes; and
for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.
User Testimonials.
We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had positive experiences with our products and Services. We occasionally publish such content.
Creation of Anonymous Data.
We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data and Customer Data by excluding information (such as name) that makes the data personally identifiable. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.
Disclosure of Your Personal Data.
We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Third-Party Service Providers and Partners.

Affiliates
”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
Corporate Restructuring.
We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving the sale, transfer, or divestiture of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Other Disclosures
. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Tapcart may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is appropriate (a) in connection with any legal investigation or proceeding; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Tapcart; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Tapcart, its affiliates or its users; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Use.

Despite your indicated preferences for commercial e-mail messages, we may continue to send you account or service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
Cookies.
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept Cookies for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Services.

Privacy Policy
Wunderkind Corporation
Effective Date of Current Policy: April 3, 2024
Wunderkind Corporation (“Wunderkind”) is a behavioral automation software and analytics company. We help website publishers (our “Clients”) drive higher engagement from their website visitors (“Users”) via our behavioral automation platform, identity platform, ad serving platform, and performance advertising platform (collectively, the “Platforms”). This Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect through our websites, including
www.wunderkind.co
(the “Websites”), our Platforms, our products, our services (“Services”), including the dashboard for our Clients to utilize or manage the Platforms and our Services (the “Services Dashboard”), and other information we receive from Clients. This Privacy Policy also describes how we use that information.  If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at
privacyrequests@wunderkind.co
.
Wunderkind is a member of the
Internet Advertising Bureau
and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adheres to the
2020 NAI self-regulatory code
, and the
Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory code
.
The Types of Information that We Collect and How We Use it
The Websites and our general business operations
Our Websites are directed to our Clients, partners and vendors which are generally businesses. We collect two types of information from visitors to our Websites: personally identifiable information and pseudonymous information. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is information that may be used to identify an individual and includes email address, telephone number or postal address. Pseudonymous information doesn’t enable us to identify anyone but may help us recognize a particular browser or device over time. Both PII and pseudonymous information are considered personal data and/or personal information in many places. We believe that maintaining the distinction between what we consider directly identifiable and what we consider to be pseudonymous can be helpful in describing our privacy practices, but recognize that some privacy laws don’t distinguish between the two types of data.
We don’t generally knowingly collect sensitive or special category data such as ethnicity, religion, sexual interest, health data or data from minors as defined under applicable law other than in an employment context which is covered under a different policy. We ask our Clients not to send this type of information to us. Some places consider precise location to be sensitive. We don’t collect or otherwise process precise geolocation data (e.g., lat/long) but we may obtain more general GEO data such as postal code or city (e.g., when we infer such information from an IP address).
We also generally don’t collect PII via the Websites unless it is provided to us. For example, if you purchase our products or Services, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.  This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date.  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you. We do not sell this information and generally will only use it for the purpose it was provided.
In addition, if you contact us by email or otherwise provide your email address to us through our Websites, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.  We reserve the right to use your email address and any other PII that you provide to us to respond to your inquiries and to send you marketing materials for our own products and Services.  We also reserve the right to share contact information you provide to us in connection with accessing certain content through our Websites (for example, webinars with industry partners) to our production partners or sponsors of such content. To the extent that such sharing of this data would be considered a sale under applicable law, we’ll provide a privacy notice and provide data subjects with the right to opt-out. We will not otherwise share your contact information with outside parties for the purposes of marketing other products and Services to you without your consent.
We also collect pseudonymous information via the Websites such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer or device you are using, the type of browser and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our Websites, the website referrer address and other log file information.  Like most websites, our Websites use “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, “cookies” and/or similar tracking technologies that allow us to track the actions of visitors to our Websites as described
here
. We use this information to help us improve our Websites and the products, Services, applications, content and features that we provide. We also enable third parties to collect pseudonymous data via the Websites. This process may be deemed a sale of information in certain jurisdictions, and we will provide a notice and provide the ability to opt-out of such sales in those jurisdictions. We reserve the right to aggregate information collected from visitors to the Websites for any purpose, including publishing aggregate statistics about our Clients’ and/or Websites’ visitors, counting and better understanding our site visitors and protecting our Websites from security issues or fraud.
The Ad Serving Platform
The Wunderkind ad serving Platform is designed to process pseudonymous information from a particular Client’s websites, mobile applications and the Client’s data partners and does not intentionally collect PII. The type of pseudonymous information collected via the ad serving Platform includes IP address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, referrer address, the time/date an ad is served and the site or mobile app that the ad is served in addition to other log file information. This information is used to offer products and Services designed to help our Clients better understand how their websites are being utilized, draw insights on how to better engage Users on their sites, to deliver more relevant advertising messages based upon the User visits to their sites, and to provide Clients with ad delivery reports. Wunderkind operates the Ad Serving Platform as a “service provider” in that we only process such information as directed in writing by each Client.
The Behavioral Automation Platform
The Behavioral Automation Platform is a marketing technology offering that enables our Clients to target ads and emails powered by data that each Client collects from direct interactions with its customers. Wunderkind processes email addresses and other PII such as telephone number via our behavioral automation Platform. We typically obtain this information from our Clients that collect it via online forms on Client owned websites. We use this data only as directed by each Client. Our systems may access this information automatically as each data point is entered by a user into a particular web form in accordance with applicable law. We combine this PII with pseudonymous information also collected via Client websites such as a Client’s User ID, mobile o/s advertising ID, hashed user emails and/or other pseudonymous IDs to help our Clients with conversion tracking, site optimization and conversion. We may also collect an email address and a Client’s User ID when directed by a Client (e.g., when a user clicks on a link sent by one of our Clients via the Client’s email service provider). Wunderkind and our Clients may also use this information to send targeted email and SMS marketing messages to our Clients’ customers and prospective customers. We only deploy messages as directed the applicable Client.
You can opt out of receiving any further marketing or promotional text (e.g, SMS/MMS) messages from Wunderkind at any time by replying “STOP” to any SMS message you receive from Wunderkind.  For help, reply “HELP” to any SMS message you receive from Wunderkind.  In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your mobile provider’s standard message and data rates may apply to the SMS message correspondence with Wunderkind according to your individual rate plan provided by your wireless carrier.  Please consult your mobile service carrier’s pricing plan to determine the charges for browsing data and sending and receiving SMS messages.  Under no circumstances will Wunderkind or Wunderkind’s affiliates be responsible for any SMS messaging or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device or telephone number. If your carrier does not permit SMS messages, you may not receive the SMS messages.
The Identity Platform
The Identity Platform is designed to enable our Clients to activate their data in and across any marketing channel. Our Clients provide us with their customer emails lists, and we hash the email address(es) for each customer into a pseudonymous ID. Our Clients may also provide us with demographic, purchase and site visit data for their customers, and that data is only used as directed by each Client.  Where our systems see that same user visit Client digital properties via different browsers and devices, we process the hashed email addresses, cookie IDs, mobile advertising o/s IDs and other pseudonymous identifiers in order to help us understand whether two devices are likely to be used by the same User or household. For example, where a User opens an email and we are able to place a cookie on that User’s browser, we may be able to determine that this was the same User that had recently visited and logged into our Client’s website. Once we’ve established that linkage, we may use the information across Clients to enable Clients to more effectively recognize Users via these pseudonymous identifiers, and to enable Clients to leverage the data collected from their sites as well as their customer demographic data.  This technology enables us to identify browsers and devices over time and across different websites via the Identify Platform while ensuring that each Client’s customer demographic and targeting data remain under the control of each individual Client. We also may enable Clients to leverage those pseudonymous identifiers to purchase advertising on the Wunderkind Performance Advertising Platform as well as digital media platforms owned and operated by third parties. We are careful to segregate this data to ensure that neither Wunderkind nor our Clients are permitted to use information collected across non-affiliated Client sites and apps to personally identify and/or re-identify individual Users.
The Performance Advertising Platform
Wunderkind also operates a Performance Advertising Platform that enables our Clients to both create and utilize interest segments (e.g., frequent shopping, interest in fishing) from data collected across multiple non-affiliated websites or mobile apps in order to deliver more relevant ads to your browser or device. These segments are provided to us by Clients based on their customer interactions with each Client (e.g., visits to Client sites). The segments may also include data provided by third-party data partners. The segments are attached to one or more pseudonymous identifiers described below for the purpose of delivering, customizing and reporting on advertising messages purchased via digital media platforms.
The Audiences Platform
The Audiences Platform is a personalization platform that acts as a central repository for Client marketing data and enables our Clients to activate that data to send marketing messages. Such marketing messages are determined by each client based on automated triggers (e.g., when a user abandons a digital shopping cart) as well as via recurring sends (e.g., monthly emails to a Client’s best customers). Wunderkind collects email addresses and other PII such as telephone number via the Audiences Platform and use this data as directed by each Client. Our systems may access this information automatically as each data point is entered by a user into a particular web form in accordance with applicable law. We combine this PII with pseudonymous information also collected via Client websites such as a Client’s User ID, mobile o/s advertising ID, hashed user emails and/or other pseudonymous IDs to help our Clients with conversion tracking, site optimization and conversion. Wunderkind and our Clients may also use this information to send customized and retargeted email, text (e.g., SMS/MMS) marketing messages to our Clients’ customers and prospective customers and we may use aggregate information to improve all of our Platforms, products or Services.
Our Services Dashboard
Employees of our Clients (“Client Personnel”) may provide contact information, such as their name and email addresses, in the Services Dashboard. We may use such contact information to message those Client Personnel to inform them about new releases, new functionality or services, training or other events being offered by Wunderkind that may be of interest to users of our Services, to provide important information about the Services (such as dates and times for scheduled maintenance), and for other purposes consistent with our ability to provide our Services and keep our Clients informed about our Services.
Additionally, when Client Personnel access or use the Services Dashboard, we will track and collect usage data, such as the date and time they visited the Services Dashboard, what information and data have been accessed via the Services Dashboard and other interactions they may have with the Services Dashboard. Wunderkind may use such data to determine the performance of the Services Dashboard, analyze how users of the Services Dashboard are utilizing our Services, identify potentially fraudulent or malicious activity, and for other purposes consistent with our ability to provide our Services and maintain or improve the Services Dashboard.
Profile Segments by the Wunderkind Platforms
The Wunderkind Platforms processes data to draw inferences about Users based upon website visits and mobile app usage. Some of our Platforms also help our Clients collect email addresses and telephone numbers. We use the collected information to help our Clients engage their site visitors and bolster their advertising programs. Some examples of behaviors which generate profiles include: whether or not a visitor has visited a particular website, purchased something from that website, interacted with certain ads or other features placed on the website and/or submitted their email address to the website. We don’t create profiles which are considered sensitive or high risk under applicable law, and we don’t sell data collected via our Platforms except as otherwise indicated. The profiles created by our Platforms enable our Clients to offer a more engaging experience when you visit their websites and help our Clients serve targeting advertising messages on other websites.
The Tracking Technologies used by our Platforms and our Services
Our Platforms and our Services may utilize tracking technologies such as pixel tags, HTML5 cookies,
HTTP cookies
,
web beacons
, statistical identifiers, and mobile o/s advertising identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA, the Android Advertising ID and other pseudonymous information. For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit
allaboutcookies.org
. Statistical identifiers are created when our systems read pseudonymous information about your computer or device, including the user agent, IP address, and the browser and operating system of your computer and device. Statistical identifiers enable our systems to determine within a reasonable level of certainty that they are encountering the same computer or device, including in environments where third-party cookies are not supported. If you want to see whether our Platforms are using a statistical identifier on the browser you are currently using, please visit
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/.
If you would like to reset the value of this identifier, you may do so
here
. More information on this reset functionality under “choice mechanisms”  below.
How We May Transfer the Information We Gather to Third Parties
Generally, we will not disclose the PII that we collect through your use of our Websites or the Services Dashboard to unaffiliated third parties without consent.  We reserve the right, however, to provide such information to our affiliates, employees, contractors, agents, service providers and designees to the extent necessary to enable them to perform certain services for us, including order fulfillment and Website-related services such as web hosting, to improve Website-related services and features, to perform maintenance services, to distribute advertisements and other marketing materials on our behalf and to host our data. Other third-party service providers used by Wunderkind include: a) cloud computer, data storage and file storage providers, b) email marketing providers, c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, e) customer billing systems partners, f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, g) social media platforms for advertising and marketing purposes, h) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly, i) auditing, debugging and security vendors. These agents work on our behalf and use data only as directed by us under written agreements which outline how they may use such data and require that such third party agents provide at least the same level of privacy protection as we do.
Wunderkind may transfer data collected through Wunderkind’s Website, and our marketing activities to entities such as: (i) website analytics vendors, who collect cookie and website engagement information to help understand website performance, (ii) advertising vendors, who collect cookie and website engagement information to target relevant advertising, and (iii) email marketing and lead database vendors, who collect email address and other personal information to improve email marketing efforts. We also may transfer some of the data collected via the Services Dashboard to analytics vendors. Some of the transfers to these entities would constitute a sale or sharing of personal information under applicable law.
Our Platforms are designed to interact with a number of other affiliated technology platforms as described
here
. While we don’t operate a data marketplace, some of the transfers of data from the Platforms may be considered a sale of personal information under certain jurisdictions in the U.S. such as the state of California. For example, where we use the Identity Platform to create pseudonymous IDs to identify browsers and devices, we enable the use of those pseudonymous IDs across multiple Clients. Where we are acting as an agent (i.e., a service provider / data processor) for our Clients, we will transfer information as directed by such Clients. This collection and use is generally subject to our respective Clients’ privacy policies, not ours. We also reserve the right to disclose any information that we collect to any third party if we believe that we are required to do so for any or all of the following reasons: (i) to comply with the law; (ii) to comply with legal processes or governmental requests including sharing data of EU and Swiss individuals in response to lawful requests from public authorities to meet national security and law enforcement requirements; (iii) to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of our Websites or our network; and/or (iv) to protect the rights, property, safety and security of Wunderkind and its employees, our Websites’ visitors, and/or the public. Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change and will provide notice of such change on our Websites.
We also may aggregate the data processed by our Website and Platforms in order to derive insights across our Clients. For example, we may publish a report that reflects aggregated statistics regarding seasonal trends in shopping patterns or outlining differences between different retail verticals. By aggregating this data, we have removed any identifiable or pseudonymous personal data.
Choice Mechanisms
Wunderkind supports high standards for digital privacy. We enable Users to opt-out from our our Identity Platform (including cross-device linking) and our Performance Advertising Platform as described below. Where our transfer of data to a third-party would be deemed a sale under applicable law, we offer a notice and the opportunity to opt-out from such sales.
Web based Opt-Out Choice Mechanisms.
You can opt-out of our Identity Platform and our Interest Based Ads Platform on your browser as follows:
You can visit Wunderkind’s opt-out page at
https://www.wunderkind.co/privacy/opt-out-of-data-processing/
.
You can visit the Network Advertising Alliance self-regulatory opt-out page at
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/
to opt-out and to see whether Wunderkind is using non-cookie based technology  on the browser you are currently using. You should select the “opt out” button there for Wunderkind.
You can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory program opt-out page at
https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN
. You should select the “opt out” button there for Wunderkind. When our systems detect that you’ve opted out via this method, we will treat your opt-out request as a request for Wunderkind to stop collecting or processing data associated with this browser in accordance with EU data protection law.
Some of the advertisements we deliver via the Services will contain the advertising option Icon, a symbol that we license from the Digital Advertising Alliance. If you click onto the advertising option icon, you will be taken to a
page like this page
where you will see behavioral advertising and other types of targeted advertising, including a mechanism that enables you to opt-out from Wunderkind’s use of data for targeted advertising.
Each of the above opt-out mechanisms will also opt you out from Wunderkind’s sale as “sale” is defined under applicable law.
When you opt out via the web-based choice mechanisms described above, we will attempt to place an opt-out cookie that instructs us not to use information about your browser for IBA on our Identity Platform and our Performance Advertising Platform.
If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit our opt-out page, we cannot set our no-track / opt-out cookie. Also, this choice mechanism is only applicable to the browser you are using, so if you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again.
Statistical device ID reset
. Wunderkind may also create a non-cookie based system created pseudonymous identifier which is used enable are systems to more effectively recognize a browser over time. Information collected as outlined in “The Types of Information that We Collect” may be associated to this identifier over time. If you would like to reset the value of this identifier, you may do so
here
. Note that any new data collected after resetting your identifier may resemble data previously collected if you engage in similar activities on websites.
Mobile App Opt-out Choice Mechanism.
Where we process pseudonymous mobile ad IDs, we honor the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). The NAI maintains a helpful list of opt-out mechanisms for mobile operating system platforms which you may find
here
. For devices where we are able to see that such a selection has been made, we will not use information collected about your mobile app usage on our Identity Platform and our performance advertising  Platform. This choice mechanism is only applicable to the apps you are using on your current mobile device.
Precise Location Choices.
While we don’t generally collect or otherwise process precise location data such as lat/long, we offer the following information as a courtesy. If you’d like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data by third parties, you may do so via your device settings. For your convenience, we provide links to instructions for both
Apple iOS
and
Android
devices. Also, most mobile applications that collect precise location information offer mechanisms to control the collection and use of precise location information. Please note that these choice mechanisms won’t impact previously collected precise location information.
Some of our Clients may utilize third-party advertisers on their websites. These third-party advertisers generally collect pseudonymous information across multiple non-affiliated websites and mobile apps to create interest segments for ad targeting and content customization purposes. This practice is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”) and is distinct from the Behavioral Automation Platform and Identity Platform offered by Wunderkind.  To learn more about third-party advertising companies and your choices regarding how that information is used, please visit
https://thenai.org/opt-out/
,
https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN
or
https://youronlinechoices.com/
.
While our systems are able to recognize a Do Not Track (DNT) setting in a browser, we currently take no response to such signals.
Wunderkind ensures that text (e.g., SMS/MMS), email, and similar direct marketing messages sent using our behavioral automation Platform contain a choice mechanism as required by applicable law.

subjects located within their jurisdictions, including: a) the right to see what
data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know), b)
the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device
(i.e., the right to delete), c) the right to correct data we have about you, your
computer or device,
d) the right to opt-out of the sale
or sharing
of data
about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to
opt-out from sales
or sharing
of your information),
e) the right to opt-out of
profiling decisions and/or targeted advertising about you, your computer or
device,
and
f
e
) the right to port such data to a different company. We do not
discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.
Data
subjects located in Colorado or Virginia also may have the right to appeal
on
privacy grounds our response to certain of your requests, and may be able to
further complain to the attorney general located in your state.
Moreover,
with respect to data subjects in these places, PII (sometimes referred to as
personal information) includes pseudonymous data such as an IP address, a
mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.
While we attempt to honor these rights
for data subjects located in all U.S. states, please note that we may not be
able to honor a right if doing so would otherwise violate applicable law.
Further details about exercising these rights can be found on our data
request page.
Data subjects may access those rights with respect to
Wunderkind by calling our toll-free California privacy hotline at (888) 594-
0111 or sending us an email to
privacyrequests@wunderkind.co
.

Special Data Protections for EU, UK and Brazil Data Subjects
.
The General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) and similar country specific data protection laws afford additional rights to data subjects located in applicable jurisdictions such as the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Brazil:
requesting information about the processing of your data, as well as the receipt of a copy of your personal data;
correcting your data;
deleting or blocking your data;
restricting the processing;
objecting to the processing of your data;
revoking your consent to the processing of your data in the future, and
complaining to the competent supervisory authority about inadmissible data processing.
These rights can be exercised by visiting our
data request page
. Moreover, with respect to data subjects in these places, PII (sometimes referred to as personal data) includes pseudonymous data such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.  Where Wunderkind is a processor of data (e.g., via the Behavioral Automation or Ad Serving Platforms), the legal basis for processing such data and the retention period is determined by our Clients. Where Wunderkind is a controller of data (e.g., via the Performance Advertising or Identity Platforms to the extent we choose to operate those platforms in the EU), the legal basis will be both legitimate interest (e.g., where we have evaluated that our interests are not overridden by Users’ fundamental rights) and consent depending on the type of information subject to processing and the information we receive from upstream partners. Where Wunderkind receives a request to cease processing of data from a data subject located in the EU or Switzerland, Wunderkind will stop all data processing with respect to the opted-out browser or device unless such processing is required by law. Wunderkind’s Data Protection Officer is Alan Chapell and Wunderkind’s EU representative is Verasafe and both may be contacted at dpo@wunderkind.co or by mailing to the address found below. Wunderkind’s UK contact details are also provided below.

Attentive’s Processing of Personal Information on Behalf of Clients
To the extent Attentive processes Personal Information on behalf of organizations (
“Clients”
) that want to engage with individual consumers (
“Client Consumers”
) through the Service, Attentive acts a data processor or service provider on behalf of these Clients. Our processing of Client Consumers’ Personal Information is described in this Privacy Policy and is governed by Attentive’s agreements with those Clients.
Client Consumers who wish to exercise any privacy rights in connection with their Personal Information that has been submitted to us by a Client should inquire with the Client directly. Because we only process Client Consumers’ data upon instruction from that Client, Client Consumers who make a request directly to us should provide to us the name of the Client who submitted their Personal Information to us. If we are able to verify the Client, we will refer the request to that Client and support them as needed in responding to the request within a reasonable timeframe.
‍
‍

Such information may include Client Consumers’ name, email address, and telephone number. Our Clients are responsible for providing notice and obtaining appropriate consents necessary for us to process this Personal Information.
Personal Information We Automatically Collect.
Like most online services, we may automatically receive and store certain Personal Information about individuals who interact with our Service through their browser or device. As discussed further below, we and our service providers may use a variety of technologies, including cookies, to assist in collecting this information.

It is in our legitimate business interests to monitor use of the Service, analyze trends, and carry out research and development.

Cookies and Similar Technologies
To collect the information in the
“Personal Information We Automatically Collect”
section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies to offer a more personalized experience by understanding and remembering Website visitors’ particular browsing preferences.
A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Service you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or emails that are designed to: (i) collect usage information like ad impressions or clicks and email open rates; (ii) measure popularity of the Service and associated advertising; and (iii) access user cookies.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods and technologies.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when certain cookies are being set or updated, or to block certain cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g.,
Internet Explorer

Apple Safari
). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at
Adobe’s website

We may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on our Service to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar technologies; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to Website visitors. To prevent Google Analytics from using Personal Information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking

When you visit our Website, Attentive may use the information collected from you in order to display advertising to you on other websites, such as Facebook or Google, about products, services, and related features that we think may be of interest to you to improve and personalize your use of the Service. This type of advertising is called retargeting. These ads may be personalized based on various factors such as the features you are using, demographic and geographic data, and other information that we collect about you. This advertising may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.
In order to provide this interest-based advertising, we may use third-party service providers who, on our behalf, may place cookies or other tracking technologies, such as cookies and SDKs on your computer browser, mobile phone applications, or other devices to collect information about your use of the Service in order to provide interest-based advertising to you both on the Website and on other websites.
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by non-affiliated third parties. As described below, these providers may offer you a way to opt-out of the collection of information that is used for our interest-based advertising to you. We cannot guarantee that these instructions will not change, or that they will continue to be available; they are controlled by each non-affiliated third party, not us.
If you are interested in more information about interest-based advertising and how you can generally control cookies and other tracking technologies from being put on your device to deliver such advertising, you may visit the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link
, the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) Consumer Opt-Out link
, or
TrustArc’s Advertising Choices Page
. To opt out of the display of interest-based advertising from Google, please visit the
Google Ads Settings
page. Facebook also offers settings that may control what information Facebook uses about you or your device activity for advertising purposes. For more information, you will need to log in to Facebook via the Sign In link and go to Settings > Ads > Ad Settings (web) or Ad Preferences > Ad Settings (app).
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Website, Website visitors may still receive advertising even if you opt-out as described above. In that case, the advertising will just not be based on your interests.
Do Not Track.

DNT
”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.
