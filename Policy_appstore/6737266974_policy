Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy outlines the procedures for collecting and protecting data from users who access, install, or utilize AAA VPN services. We encourage users to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how their information is handled by AAA VPN. By continuing to use AAA VPN services, users acknowledge and accept the practices detailed in this Privacy Policy. If any user disagrees with any part of this Privacy Policy, they are advised to refrain from using AAA VPN services.
The privacy and security of customer information are our top priorities. We collect only essential user data necessary for the operation of our services. All terms and definitions in this Privacy Policy are elaborated in our Terms of Use. By engaging with the AAA VPN website, submitting personal information, or using our services, users agree to this Privacy Policy and enter into a legally binding agreement with Nebula App Development, LLC, hereafter referred to as "AAA VPN," "we," or "us."
Data Handling
AAA VPN limits data processing to what is strictly necessary for providing services, processing payments, and managing the AAA VPN website and mobile applications. Data may be processed automatically or manually, without involvement from subsidiaries unless otherwise specified. For payment processing, email services, marketing, and basic analytics, we utilize third-party processors. We maintain a strict no-logs policy, ensuring that user activities are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored, or shared with third parties.
Data Collection
Registration is optional. If you choose to register, you must provide an email address, which allows us to send important service updates and notifications. A valid email address is also required for password recovery and establishing a VPN connection. For payment processing, we handle basic billing details through our payment partners. Users must ensure their payment information is accurate and current. AAA VPN may also collect limited technical data to enhance service quality. Without this data, we may not be able to fully deliver our services, which includes server load information to suggest optimal servers for users.
Advertising and Data Sharing
We partner with third-party advertisers to collect data using cookies and pixel tags for targeted advertising based on user preferences. This data collection may extend across devices and include ads from unrelated companies. While we do not control third-party cookies, we advise users to be cautious and review third-party privacy policies for information about their cookie practices. Our data exchange and insights partnership is with Admob (Privacy Policy: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).
Underage Users
Individuals under the age of 18 are prohibited from using AAA VPN services without parental or guardian supervision. We assume that all users and data providers are at least 18 years old. If we discover any underage users or inaccurate data, we reserve the right to immediately terminate their access to AAA VPN services.
Data Processing Justification
We process personal data to provide the best possible service in accordance with the contractual agreement outlined in our Terms of Service. Direct marketing may utilize your email address with your consent or as permitted by law without needing separate consent.
Data Protection Rights
Users have the right to inquire about their personal data we hold, request corrections, object to certain data usages, and ask for data deletion. We comply with legal requirements to retain or share limited data when necessary, but we do not log browsing histories or IP addresses, making it challenging to link activities to individual users.
Opt-Out and Data Control
Users can opt out of communications and manage cookie settings through their browser. If you disagree with our data processing methods, you may discontinue using AAA VPN services and request the cessation of data processing.
Data Retention Period
AAA VPN retains minimal personal data only as long as necessary to provide our services, up to a maximum of 2 years after the last use. Users may request a detailed list of the personal data we have collected by contacting contacts@nebulaappdev.com.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time, and we encourage users to review it regularly. Changes take effect upon publication. Users cannot transfer their rights under this Privacy Policy to third parties. For any privacy-related questions or to exercise your privacy rights, please contact us at contacts@nebulaappdev.com.
