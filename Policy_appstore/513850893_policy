Non-Legalese
You will always keep your information updated and will always provide truthful and accurate information.
1.03    NO GOVERNMENT AFFILIATION – DMV MANUAL GOVERNS.
As stated, we are not owned, operated or affiliated with the Government
. Driving-tests.org is not connected to any Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in any state or to any other agency or mechanism that administers, creates, processes or grades driving license or permit examinations. Our website contains general information regarding the DMV in each state of the United States for informational and educational purposes only. When we use the acronym "
DMV
" we are not claiming to act on behalf of, nor that we are endorsed, sponsored or sanctioned by any governmental unit or authority. Where we make a definitive statement regarding the test or the motor vehicle laws or regulations in your state, we are referencing your state’s official DMV manual and/or your state’s motor vehicle laws.  In rare instances, our interpretation of the DMV manual’s wording may be inaccurate in some respect;  you hereby recognize this fact and agree to always rely on the manual and laws in your state as the final word on the official test materials.
Our practice tests are intended for training and learning purposes only. We do not represent that you will get the same exact questions and answers on the official examination.  The practice tests are intended to give you a good idea of what to expect and what to pay particular attention to while studying the driver’s handbook for your State. The testing that we provide tries to follow as closely as possible the subject matter stressed in the DMV handbooks but the actual test questions can never be assuredly predicted so that the client/customer agrees and acknowledges that the testing and learning techniques are helpful tools but they can never assure certain test questions or answers, nor a certain result on an official state examination.
All drivers’ handbooks presented at Driving-tests.org are also publicly available at the official web sites of State-specific DMVs.
We are confident that our program mirrors closely the material concepts that will be on your official exam. That is because our experienced experts have spent years continually reviewing each state’s DMV manual to sift the key and changing material for your assistance and preparation. You should, however, always expect to see questions on the official examination that are worded differently from what you have seen before. Fortunately, our experts have incorporated into the Driving-Tests.org program important learning techniques regarding test preparation so that you will know how to read, approach and analyze the official questions in the most effective manner possible.  If you follow the program that we lay out for you and stay focused on learning the material, your chances will be greatly enhanced.
Non-Legalese
Although our program effectively informs and prepares you for the test, your state's DMV manual and related laws are the sole official authority governing the test material.

Where the violation is egregious and results in damage to our resources or affects the facilities or operational functionality for any period of time, or where it appears to violate any law or regulation, you, the client/customer, recognize and agree that we may report the attack to the authorities for prosecution and will take legal action as may be appropriate under the circumstances.

https://driving-tests.org/motorcycle-premium
, and
https://driving-tests.org/cdl-premium/

4.0     REFUND/CANCELLATION POLICY AND PASS GUARANTEE
(A)      Pass Guarantee:
We are so confident of the results of our powerful learning and testing techniques that we devised a way for customers who do not pass the official knowledge exam to receive a full refund under certain limited, specified conditions.  The
Pass Guarantee
will be provided only to a customer who meets the following conditions and qualifications:
The customer must purchase a plan that provides a Pass Guarantee as part of the package. The customer must then enable Pass Guarantee protection on the website when prompted (immediately after logging into their Premium account for the first time), and successfully pass every practice test for his or her state on Driving-Tests.org.
The customer must fail their official knowledge test administered by their state’s DMV and provide a true and correct copy of official proof of failure.
The customer must  email us at
info@driving-tests.org
and request a refund under the Pass Guarantee program: their most recent completion of all the tests should be not earlier than 30 days before your exam date. We will decide in our sole discretion whether an individual who requests a Refund is entitled to one. Any changes in the foregoing procedures will be instituted at our sole and exclusive discretion and will be published online on our Website and on this page. We reserve the right to modify the conditions for Pass Guarantee at our sole discretion but we will strive to give notification on the Website or herein so that our customers will know the rules. We reserve the right to discontinue this program without advance notice at our sole discretion.
The customer claiming the Pass Guarantee refund must be the primary account holder. Additional family members that received their free accounts as part of the Family Sharing packages are not covered by the Pass Guarantee and not eligible for any kind of refund.
(B)     Refund Policy:
Driving-Tests also has a discretionary
Refund Policy
for Premium customers. You hereby acknowledge and agree that, despite reference to a refund policy, that Driving-Tests.Org has a standard
no-refund policy.
Like most website businesses, we do not grant refunds because the economic cost of opening, establishing, processing and maintaining a customer’s account is formidable. Therefore, we issue refunds only in rare, meritorious cases, in our sole and exclusive discretion. We sometimes issue a refund where a technical problem has arisen in the delivery or quality of the product or service to the customer. However, you must contact us first and attempt to resolve the obstacle first. If the problem could have been easily resolved and you do not timely contact us about it, then we will not consider a refund.  A technical problem that could justify a refund if it cannot be quickly fixed in certain situations is:
Non-delivery of the product: due to some mailing issues of your e-mail provider or mail server, or some technical glitch on our side, you might not receive a delivery email from us. In this case, contacting us for assistance will often resolve the problem.
Major defects: although all the PDF products (Cheat Sheets) are thoroughly tested before release, unexpected errors may occur. Such issues must be reported directly to our
technical support
department, which usually will result in a resolution, correction and/or re-issuance of the product where we deem it to be justified and appropriate.
Product not-as-described: such issues must be reported to our technical support within 14 days from the date of the purchase. Clear evidence must be provided proving that the purchased product is not as it is described on the product description page.
Complaints which are based merely on the customer's false expectations or wishes are not honored.  By way of example and not by way of limitation, there is no obligation to provide a refund or credit in the following situations:
You changed your mind about the service;
You bought the service by mistake;
You do not have sufficient expertise to use the service.
You need return of your money for some other purpose.
Once a request for refund is received, Driving-Tests.org will review it. If we in our sole and exclusive discretion believe that a refund, either partial or total, is warranted, we will issue the amount that we determine within 14 business days. Once the refund is issued, the customer's Premium account will be downgraded to a free account.  Please note that when purchasing a product or service through our website you, as a customer, are considered to be aware of our Refund Policy statements and all of the within Terms and Conditions that may be applicable.
Non-Legalese
We provide a full refund under the Pass Guarantee program if you meet certain qualifications; other refund requests are considered at our sole and exclusive discretion.
(C)     Cancellation policy.
Customers may cancel their Premium membership and/or subscription at any time by emailing: info@driving-tests.org and providing their membership name and e-mail address. If a refund is requested, include your reason for the request. If you cancel your subscription plan after you have paid your current month’s payment, no refund is provided. No refunds are provided for our withdrawal of payments from your automatic renewal program, and as stated below, it is up to you to take steps to stop the automatic payments from recurring. You can do this within our Website. In order to prevent the next upcoming automatic renewal withdrawal, you must inform us of the cancellation within 5 days prior to your subscription renewal date
and
at the same time you must take the steps to disengage the auto renewal function by going onto our Website and following instructions.
Therefore, in order to assure that you are not charged by auto renewal during a transitionary period, you must act in advance, as stated, and prior to the funds being withdrawn by the automatic renewal process. Once the funds are withdrawn, a request for a refund is invalid and not honored.
(D)     Cessation of Services Upon Cancellation or Failure to Pay.
We will cease to provide services on your subscription renewal date if you have either notified us of a cancelation prior to that date or if you fail to provide pre-payment for the renewal of the next 30-day period of service, or if you withdraw the authorized pre-payment from your payor.
(E)      Recurring Subscriptions and Automatic Renewal of Premium Account.
If you select a Service with an auto-renewal feature (“Recurring Subscription”), such as but not limited to CDL Premium Monthly, you authorize Driving-Tests to maintain your account information and charge that account automatically upon the renewal of the Service you choose, with no further action required by you. In the event that Driving-Tests is unable to charge your account as authorized by you when you enrolled in a Recurring Subscription, Driving-Tests may, in its sole discretion, bill you for the Service and suspend your access to the Service until payment is received. It is your responsibility to cancel the service auto-renewal once it is no longer needed. If you subscribed on our website, you can cancel auto-renewal by contacting Support at info@driving-tests.org or by going to Settings in your account. If you subscribed using one of our apps, you can cancel the subscription on your device. At the discretion of Driving-Tests.org, we may be unable to provide a full or partial refund in the event that you are charged by our automatic renewal function for services not used.
Non-Legalese
Customers may cancel their Premium service by notifying us. We will stop providing premium services upon cancellation or failure to timely pay. When the customer purchases a premium service with a subscription plan, it is the customer's responsibility to stop the automatic renewal charges. Refunds are not given for automatic renewal charges that are already withdrawn from the customer's account.
4.1     CHARGEBACKS
AS STATED, WE HAVE A NO REFUND, NO CHARGEBACK POLICY
.
Although partial or total refunds may be paid at Driving-Tests.org’s discretion under very limited circumstances,
the rule in most instances is that we do not issue refunds and we prohibit and may penalize your use of chargeback procedures with your payment service.
If you have an issue with a charge or payment to us, you hereby agree to contact us first for clarification of the charge before you contact your credit card company to request a dispute or reversal of the charge. Therefore, if you want to use the service, you hereby agree that chargebacks are not to be used under any circumstances.
You shall not make any chargebacks and/or deny or reverse any payment made by you regarding a bill owed to Driving-Tests.org,  and you shall reimburse us for any loss or damage that we incur because of any such action by you or your financial institution or representative, including reimbursement to us of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in collecting the amount owed. You promise to pay promptly all your debts to Driving-Tests.org, and you agree that we shall have all rights of collection stated herein.
You understand and acknowledge that the use of chargeback procedures could result in your preclusion from using our free services as well as our premium programs.
Non-Legalese
You agree not to use Chargebacks to compel us to issue a refund or for any other purpose.
4.2     RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS PROCEDURE
Driving-Tests.Org is committed to providing a great service to our customers. We therefore expect to resolve any issues between us in a mutually satisfactory manner. Most disputes or disagreements are minor, and they are resolved in-house between us on an informal basis. When you have an issue, you may communicate directly with a representative of the company. If the initial contact does not resolve your issue, then put it in writing and send to info@driving-tests.org.  We will review again and respond within 48 hours. We will continue to discuss the issue if we are still at an impasse. This will be a process of mediation where we will informally try to find an acceptable ground for both sides of the issue. If there is no possibility of a resolution, you will have the option of bringing a civil action in a court of applicable jurisdiction and venue, but you understand and agree to be limited by the damages cap listed below.
Non-Legalese
When conflicts arise with a customer, we expect to be able to resolve the problem amicably through our help and support department.
5.0     DISCLAIMERS – NO WARRANTIES AND NO LIABILITY FOR LOSSES
Although there are limitations to our liability, your satisfaction is very important to us. We encourage you to contact us at any time that you feel that our services are not in accordance with our mutual agreement. We hope to avoid conflicts by having our courteous, proactive administrative staff assist you every step of the way and try to accommodate your expressed needs within reasonable standards accepted in the industry.
However, you, the Client, affirm that you understand and agree that the intensity of competition online is great, and we must limit our potential liability to the maximum degree allowed by law.  Therefore, you agree to the following limitations, and if you do not, you will cease the registration process and exit the site.
