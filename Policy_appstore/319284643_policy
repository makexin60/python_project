When you leave an AELTC Digital Platform, We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website that you visit.
2 THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
2.1 Personal data, or personal information, means information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual. It does not include data where the identity of the individual to whom it relates has been removed (anonymous data).

For example, We may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific AELTC Digital Platform feature. However, if We combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, We treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

”). This enables you to receive certain information in relation to the processing of your personal data and a copy of the personal data We hold about you and to check that We are lawfully processing it;
(b)
Request correction
of the personal data that We hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data We hold about you corrected, though We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to Us;
(c)
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask Us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for Us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask Us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where We may have processed your information unlawfully or where We are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law;
Note, however, that We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
(d)
Object to processing
of your personal data where We are relying on a Legitimate Interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where We are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, We may demonstrate that We have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
(e)
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask Us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want Us to establish the data’s accuracy; (ii) where Our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want Us to erase it; (iii) where you need Us to hold the data even if We no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to Our use of your data but We need to verify whether We have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;

Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or, where technically feasible, to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, the personal data provided to Us by you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies where the personal data is processed using automated means and where the processing relies on your consent for Us to use your personal data or where the processing of the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you; and
(g)
Withdraw consent
at any time where We are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, We may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Targeting Cookies
These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store specific personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
