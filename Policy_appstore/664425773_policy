3. Legal Basis for using your personal information
Canon will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.
The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal information. In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:
Performance of a contract with you: where you have ordered or requested products or Services from us and we need to use your contact details payment information and other relevant transactional information in order to process your order and deliver the products or Services to you.
Consent: for example, where you have indicated you would like to receive marketing and offers from Canon, or where you have provided information to us voluntarily in order to enter a competition. You can withdraw your consent at any time, (e.g., by clicking unsubscribe, changing your settings on your user account menu or an application menu), however, the means by which you may do so may vary from country to country.
The legitimate business interests of Canon: where it is necessary for Canon to understand our customers, promote our goods, products and Services and operate effectively as a multinational manufacturer of imaging and photography products. For more information see section 3.1 below.
Compliance with law: where Canon is subject to a legal obligation and needs to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.
3.1 Our Legitimate Interests
The legitimate business interest of Canon referred to above is to market and tailor our products and services in line with customer demand in order to grow our business. For example, we perform analytics on this legal basis as this is necessary to provide you with a tailored experience and allows us to improve, maintain and manage our products and Services in a way which meets your expectations as a customer.
4. How we share your information
Except as set out in this policy or where you have provided your consent, the personal information processed when you use our Services will not be shared with or disclosed to other individuals or businesses, for their own use, other than Canon group companies.
For example, we may disclose your personal information to the following third parties for the purposes described here:
Vendors, other subcontractors or resellers with whom we have a business relationship and who provide products and services to us so that we can provide our Services to you (such as warehousing and delivery, software development, website hosting and management);
Third-party service providers which carry out marketing campaigns or run customer surveys on our behalf;
Payment processing companies, credit reference agencies and anti-fraud screening service providers in order to process payments and (where necessary) to carry out fraud-screening;
With our professional and legal advisers for the purposes of obtaining commercial, financial or legal advice;
In the event that we sell any business assets, personal information may be disclosed to a potential buyer. In these circumstances, we will make reasonable attempts to ensure the buyer will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy;
In exceptional circumstances, personal information may be shared with third parties, such as the police and regulatory authorities, to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our customers, staff and assets;
We may also disclose your personal information if it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation in any jurisdiction, including where that obligation arises as a result of a voluntary act or decision by us (e.g., our decision to operate in a country or a related decision).
Your personal information may be shared by and between Canon and other Canon group companies in order to provide our Services to you.
5. How we protect your information
5.1 How we keep data secure
Your personal information is held on secure servers and is not processed for any purposes other than those set out in this Privacy Policy. The servers Canon uses to store this information are accessible to Canon authorized persons only and Canon ensures that adequate security measures are in place.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at the contact details below.
5.2 How we transfer data abroad
We use vendors and service providers based around the world. Consequently, your personal information may be processed in countries outside of the country where you live, including if you live in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, and such countries may include some where you may have fewer legal rights in respect of your personal information than you do under local law. If we transfer personal information outside to a country that provides a lower standard of legal protection for your personal information, we will ensure that your privacy rights are adequately protected by appropriate safeguards, for example, through the use of the EU's standard contractual clauses if your personal information is transferred from inside the European Economic Area to outside. Please contact us if you would like more information about these safeguards.
6. Intended Age
Our Services are only available to those who are the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which they reside. Access and use of our Services by anyone under the age of majority is only permitted with the express permission of a parent or legal guardian.
7. Marketing Communications
If you provided your consent when signing up to our Services, or at a later stage, Canon and/or other Canon group companies will use your personal information for marketing purposes and to inform you about other products and services, which Canon thinks might be of interest for you. You can specify whether you wish to receive such information.
You will be able to withdraw your consent to receiving such information at any time by editing your communication preferences of your account or by selecting a unsubscribing link provided in applicable communications. If you withdraw your consent for marketing, please note we may still contact you with service messages from time to time (for example, to confirm an order you have made or to confirm delivery details).
8. How to exercise your rights
In certain jurisdictions you have the right to access, correct, update, restrict, receive a machine-readable copy of your personal information or delete your personal information as well as any other right applicable in your jurisdiction. You can request to exercise these rights by accessing your Canon ID accounts, clicking on the link provided in our communication emails, or accessing the relevant section of the Canon websites or apps or by contacting us using the contact details set out at the end of this Policy.
In order to delete your personal information, you need to sign into the Canon ID website on
myid.canon
and delete your account. Note that after the deletion of your personal information, it cannot be recovered by you and any data and content stored on the Services will also be deleted. We will also delete your personal information once it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected. Please note that we will not delete your personal information if we must retain it in accordance with Section 3 or where it relates to an active relationship or a product or service requested by you (e.g., a recent purchase made at a Canon Services).
You also have the right to object to your personal information being used for certain purposes, including to send you marketing. See 'Marketing Communications' above, for more details of how to withdraw your consent for marketing.
We will comply with any requests to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware, however, that there are a number of limitations to these rights, and there may be circumstances where we are not able to comply with your request. To make any requests regarding your personal information, or if you have any questions or concerns regarding your personal information, you should contact us as set out in section 12 using the details below. You are also entitled to contact and lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
9. Retention, Deletion procedures and methods of your information
Canon will keep your personal information until we achieve the purposes set out in section 2, section 3 and section 8 of this Privacy Policy (e.g., until you delete your Canon ID account) and in accordance with any retention periods required by applicable laws and during the relevant statutes of limitations. For example, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint about a product or our Services) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim. Where we no longer have a need to keep your personal information, we will delete it without delay as follows:
Deletion Procedures:
We identify the personal information to be deleted and delete in compliance with the process set out by our responsible person for data protection.
Deletion Methods:
If the personal information is recorded or stored on electronic media, we delete it in an irrecoverable manner. If the personal information is recorded on paper, we delete it by crushing, incinerating, or dissolving.
Please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.
10. Your commitments
By signing in to any of our Services and accepting this Privacy Policy, you confirm that you are above the age applicable in your jurisdiction for engaging in contracts. You also confirm that you have previously gathered any necessary parental/guardian consent required in your country of residence, where applicable. We will contact you at any time in order to check the above and reserve the right to suspend or delete your Canon ID accounts in case you cannot prove this.
You guarantee the quality of the information provided in our Services. All personal information you send to Canon must be real, accurate and kept up to date. You take full responsibility that your information is accurate, updated and that it complies with this principle. You also guarantee that you have gathered the explicit consent from anyone holding any personal image, intellectual property or other rights over your content, authorizing you to upload and store it in our Services.
11. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will update our Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure you are promptly informed of Canon's data processing activities. We will not engage in any processing operations that might put in risk your personal information, and will gather your consent where necessary to safeguard your right to privacy and where required to do so under the law of your local jurisdiction. We will keep you updated on any changes to this Privacy Policy through the Services. We will also use any of the communication methods provided by you to inform you on important changes to this Privacy Policy.

How is privacy governed in Canon?
Canon’s Group Data Protection Officer is supported by a network of DPOs and Privacy Champions, whose roles and responsibilities are clearly defined which helps ensure compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy and data protection laws throughout EMEA.
The Canon Europe Group (Canon EMEA) spans Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Across this large region there are many different privacy laws that apply. The Canon Privacy Accountability Framework was developed to ensure that privacy considerations are dealt with in a uniform and standardised way across all our markets and for the smooth operation of our business. The requirements of the European Union and other European, Middle Eastern and African privacy legislations have been incorporated into the Canon Privacy Accountability Framework.
Does Canon conduct risk assessments around personal data?
Canon EMEA has well defined governance, risk management and compliance processes. These processes include:
• Privacy risk assessments
• Privacy impact assessments/data protection impact assessments
• Vendor risk assessments
• Security assessments
Does Canon maintain Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)?
Canon has processes in place to comply with privacy requirements including maintaining/updating Records of Processing Activities and completing Privacy Impact Assessments(PIA)/Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA).
Does Canon have formal processes for handling data breaches?
Canon is firmly committed to protecting the personal data of all stakeholders including employees, suppliers and customers. In order to meet this commitment and our obligations under applicable data protection laws, Canon has implemented a ‘Breach Management Policy’. This policy explains what constitutes a data breach and the initial steps that employees should take when a suspected data breach is discovered. There are a number of operational guidelines that supplement this policy.
Are Canon employees trained on privacy?
Canon employees and contractors receive mandatory training on privacy and data protection. Additional mandatory training is provided to our Privacy Champions who are assigned with special responsibility for privacy in their specific business area.
Are Canon employees who access and process personal data committed to respect confidentiality?
All Canon employees, including those who work with the personal data of our employees, partners or customers, are bound by confidentiality provisions in employment contracts. The importance of confidentiality is continuously reinforced through training and awareness creation.
Are Canon vendors and other third parties compliant with data protection regulations?
Canon requires that third parties, including vendors and partners, who process personal data on behalf of Canon are contractually bound to safeguard any personal data they receive from Canon and are prohibited from using the personal data for any purpose other than to perform the services as instructed by Canon. Canon has also implemented a risk-based compliance assessment for suppliers handling Canon or Canon’s customers’ data.
How does Canon comply with data transfer restrictions across the EMEA regions in which it operates?
Canon uses appropriate transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual clauses, where applicable. In jurisdictions where Standard Contractual clauses are not available, Canon complies with local privacy requirements.
Where can I get more information about any of the topics discussed in the ‘Canon Privacy Trust Centre’?
