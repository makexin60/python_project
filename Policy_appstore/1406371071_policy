Platform services and hosting
These services have the purpose of hosting and running key components of Tide Guide & Buoy Weather, therefore allowing the provision of Tide Guide & Buoy Weather from within a unified platform. Such platforms provide a wide range of tools to the Owner  –  e.g. analytics, user registration, commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment processing – that imply the collection and handling of Personal Data.
