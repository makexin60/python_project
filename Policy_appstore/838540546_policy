Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to All Our Apps and Websites  (“We”, 
“Us”, or “Our”). The collection, use, disclosure, and protection of 
information gathered through our websites (hereinafter “Web sites” or 
“Sites”) and through mobile applications (hereinafter “Apps”) is defined
 under the terms of this policy. We are committed to protecting the 
confidentiality and security of information it collects through its Web 
sites and Apps. Please read the following carefully. Your use of the Web
 sites and Apps is governed by this Privacy Policy, along with our Terms
 of Service.
PERSONAL INFORMATION – NO COLLECTION, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
“Personal Information” refers to information that identifies you 
individually, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, 
financial account number, social security number, or driver’s license 
number. Currently, Web sites and Apps do not collect Personal 
Information.
We collect Non-Personal Information, which, alone, cannot be used to 
identify you. Examples of Non-Personal Information include page views, 
unique views, average time on the Web site or using Apps, browsers, and 
operating systems.
Non-Personal Information is passively collected, which means that it 
is collected without you having to do anything, using the following 
tracking technologies:
Cookies
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your browser, 
either for the duration of your Web site session (called “session” 
cookies) or more permanently (called “persistent” cookies). Anonymous 
identifiers are sometimes used in place of cookies on mobile devices 
which may not support cookie technology.
You may opt to enable a feature on your browser that will erase 
cookies, block all cookies, or warn you before cookies are stored or 
exchanged. Please be aware, however, that some parts of the Web sites 
may no longer function properly if cookies are disabled.
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons and Web Logs
Pixel tags, also known as web beacons, function similarly to 
cookies. A pixel tag is an invisible, one pixel-sized piece of code 
which transmits certain information to Our servers. They are placed on 
key pages, tools, and areas of the Web sites and Apps. When a visitor 
requests, visits, and/or clicks on anything that includes a pixel tag, 
the information about the visitor’s action is recorded in a web log.
We will use your Non-Personal Information in one or more of the following ways:
To fulfill a request or provide you with services;
In the aggregate to help us evaluate and modify existing services 
and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of 
interest to our users;
As necessary for the Web sites or Apps to function properly;
To understand how people are using the Web sites or Apps;
To improve user experience;
To recognize repeat visitors and facilitate ongoing access to the Web sites or Apps.
MOBILE APPS
When you download or purchase an App you do so through a third party 
mobile application online store. You may be required to register with 
the mobile app store and be logged on before you can download or 
purchase an App. When downloading an App the app provider will typically
 collect certain device and app-related information.
Our Apps sometimes send push notifications, or notices of interest 
sent out to in the absence of a specific request, to your mobile device.
 In the event a Our Apps uses push notifications, you are provided an 
opportunity to opt into receiving those push notifications. If you 
decline to accept push notifications, you will not receive push 
notifications, which means you may not receive the most current updates 
and features of the App.
Our Apps will collect precise information about the location of your 
mobile device, but you can opt-out by changing the settings on your 
mobile device. If you decline to share your location with the App, you 
may not receive the most accurate recommendations.
Our Apps do not collect the unique identification number assigned to 
your device by your operating system (sometimes called a UDID), or your 
contact list or address book, and do not collect any information on the 
contacts stored in your mobile device. This information will only be 
collected if it is necessary for the functioning of an App and will be 
disclosed to you prior to downloading the App.
You have the right of election when it comes to how Apps function on your mobile device. You may be able to:
manage push notifications by using your built-in mobile device settings and controls;
manage location information by using your built-in mobile device settings and controls;
manage/restrict in-app purchases by using your built-in mobile device settings and controls;
block navigation to the web by turning off network access on the device or turning off the browser.
Access to or availability of controls may vary depending on your device.
Social Network Log-In
You may use your Facebook log-in details to log-in to Our Apps. 
Facebook will share with Us, based on the Facebook privacy policy, the 
information available on your Facebook account, including, without 
limitation, your profile information, friends’ names, photos, privacy 
settings and certain other information that will be explained to you 
(and authorized by you) during the App’s log-in process. Please refer to
 the Facebook privacy policy and your privacy settings for more 
information. If you do not consent to this sharing, please do not log-in
 through Facebook.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The Web sites and Apps offered are not directed at children who are 
under 18 years of age. It is Our policy to require that individuals 
using the Web sites or downloading the App be 18 years of age or older.

How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.
