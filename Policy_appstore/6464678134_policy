Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
In the following, we provide information about the collection of personal data when using
our website https://numastays.com
our profiles in social media.
Personal data is any data that can be related to a specific natural person, such as their name or IP address.
1.1. Contact details
The controller within the meaning of Art. 4 para. 7 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is numa Group GmbH, Potsdamer Strasse 68a, 10785 Berlin, Germany,
email: privacy@numastays.com.
We are legally represented by Christian Gaiser, Torsten Weihrich, Dimitri Chandogin, Gerhard Maringer.
Our data protection officer can be reached via heyData GmbH, Schützenstraße 5, 10117 Berlin,
www.heydata.eu
, E-Mail:

.
More specific information on the delimitation of responsibilities between numa Group GmbH and the national numa companies can be found below 4.
1.2. Scope of data processing, processing purposes and legal bases
We detail the scope of data processing, processing purposes and legal bases below. In principle, the following come into consideration as the legal basis for data processing:
Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 it. a GDPR serves as our legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent.
Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR is the legal basis insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract, e.g. if a site visitor purchases a product from us or we perform a service for him. This legal basis also applies to processing that is necessary for pre-contractual measures, such as in the case of inquiries about our products or services.
Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. c GDPR applies if we fulfill a legal obligation by processing personal data, as may be the case, for example, in tax law.
Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis when we can rely on legitimate interests to process personal data, e.g. for cookies that are necessary for the technical operation of our website.
1.3. Data processing outside the EEA
Insofar as we transfer data to service providers or other third parties outside the EEA, the security of the data during the transfer is guaranteed by adequacy decisions of the EU Commission, insofar as they exist (e.g. for Great Britain, Canada and Israel) (Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR).
If no adequacy decision exists (e.g. for the USA), the legal basis for the data transfer are usually, i.e. unless we indicate otherwise, standard contractual clauses. These are a set of rules adopted by the EU Commission and are part of the contract with the respective third party. According to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. b GDPR, they ensure the security of the data transfer. Many of the providers have given contractual guarantees that go beyond the standard contractual clauses to protect the data. These include, for example, guarantees regarding the encryption of data or regarding an obligation on the part of the third party to notify data subjects if law enforcement agencies wish to access the respective data.
1.4. Storage duration
Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and no legal obligations to retain data conflict with the deletion. If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is restricted, i.e. the data are blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons.
1.5. Rights of data subjects
Data subjects have the following rights against us with regard to their personal data:
Right of access,
Right to correction or deletion,
Right to limit processing,
Right to object to the processing
,
Right to data transferability,
Right to revoke a given consent at any time
.
Data subjects also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of their personal data. Contact details of the data protection supervisory authorities are available at https://www.bfdi.bund.de/EN/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html.
1.6. Obligation to provide data
Within the scope of the business or other relationship, customers, prospective customers or third parties need to provide us with personal data that is necessary for the establishment, execution and termination of a business or other relationship or that we are legally obliged to collect. Without this data, we will generally have to refuse to conclude the contract or to provide a service or will no longer be able to perform an existing contract or other relationship.
Mandatory data are marked as such.
1.7. No automatic decision making in individual cases
As a matter of principle, we do not use a fully automated decision-making process in accordance with article 22 GDPR to establish and implement the business or other relationship. Should we use these procedures in individual cases, we will inform of this separately if this is required by law.
1.8. Making contact
When contacting us, e.g. by e-mail or telephone, the data provided to us (e.g. names and e-mail addresses) will be stored by us in order to answer questions. The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR) to answer inquiries directed to us. We delete the data accruing in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations.
1.9. Customer surveys
From time to time, we conduct customer surveys to get to know our customers and their wishes better. In doing so, we collect the data requested in each case. It is our legitimate interest to get to know our customers and their wishes better, so that the legal basis for the associated data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit f GDPR. We delete the data when the results of the surveys have been evaluated.
1.10. Customer account
Guests can open a customer account on our website. We process the data requested in this context based on the consent of the site visitor. Legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR.
The consent may be revoked at any time by contacting us, for example, using the contact details provided in our privacy policy. The revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the processing until the revocation. If the consent is revoked we will delete the data insofar as we are not obliged or have a right to retain it further.
2. Newsletter
We reserve the right to inform customers who have already used services from us or purchased goods from time to time by e-mail or other means electronically about our offers, if they have not objected to this. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to conduct direct advertising (recital 47 GDPR). Customers can object to the use of their e-mail address for advertising purposes at any time without incurring additional costs, for example via the link at the end of each e-mail or by sending an e-mail to our above-mentioned e-mail address.
Based on the consent of the recipients (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR), we also measure the opening and click-through rate of our newsletters to understand what is relevant for our audience.

3.3. Vacant positions
We publish positions that are vacant in our company on our website, on pages linked to the website or on third-party websites.
The processing of the data provided as part of the application is carried out for the purpose of implementing the application process. Insofar as this is necessary for our decision to establish an employment relationship, the legal basis is Art. 88 para. GDPR in conjunction with Sec. 26 para. 1 of the German Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). We have marked the data required to carry out the application process accordingly or refer to them. If applicants do not provide this data, we cannot process the application.
Further data is voluntary and not required for an application. If applicants provide further information, the basis is their consent (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR).
We ask applicants to refrain from providing information on political opinions, religious beliefs and similarly sensitive data in their CV and cover letter. They are not required for an application. If applicants nevertheless provide such information, we cannot prevent their processing as part of the processing of the resume or cover letter. Their processing is then also based on the consent of the applicants (Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR).

If applicants have given us their consent to use their data for further application procedures as well, we will not delete their data until one year after receiving the application.
3.4. Bookings via the website
Users can make bookings via our website. In doing so, we process the following personal data as part of the booking process:
IP-address
Name
E-mail address
Phone number (optional)
Address
Company name (if applicable)
Date of arrival and expected departure
Number of accompanying persons
The data is processed to fulfill the contract concluded with the respective guest (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b GDPR).
3.4.1. Check-In process on the website
We offer a facilitated check-in process over our website. For this purpose, we offer guests two options:
Option 1:
The check-in is carried out by verifying the ID document and reading the information from the document on the basis of a data protection consent given before the start of the check-in (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR). For this purpose, we use the service provider Incode (​Incode Technologies, Inc., 221 Main Street, Suite 520, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA​). The provider processes First and last name, E-Mail address, information about the guest's stay, all information included in the ID document and a copy of the ID document. The processing takes place exclusively in the European Union. The purpose of the processing is, on the one hand, to offer guests a quick and convenient way to carry out self-check-in, namely to complete it directly via the Numa website. On the other hand, the purpose of the processing is also to prevent crime, protect property and ensure the accountability of guests.
Option 2:
Alternatively, guests can choose to check in via video call (similar to a physical reception desk in a hotel). The purpose of the processing is the operation of a digital operation of our business. In this case, the following personal data is processed: First and last name, E-Mail address, and information about the guest's stay. The legal basis for this processing is therefore Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f. We have a legitimate interest to maintain a digital operation of our accommodation.
If the guest is not a German citizen, the ID document is also processed for the purposes of complying with §§ 29 BMG. The legal basis for this processing is therefore Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. c GDPR. If such cases, we are also obliged to share the data with German authorities, and, in accordance with § 30 para. 4 BMG, to keep the data for one year from the date of departure of the accommodated person and to destroy it within three months after the expiry of the retention period. The copy of the ID document is kept for 7 days after the check-out of the guest for the purposes of ensuring the correctness of the information collected, and subsequently deleted. If the guest doesn’t show up to the booking or cancels the reservation before check-in, the copy of the ID is deleted immediately.
3.5. Payment processors
For the processing of payments, we use payment processors who are themselves data controllers within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. Insofar as they receive data and payment data entered by us in the ordering process, we thereby fulfill the contract concluded with our customers (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR).

5. Data processing on social media platforms
We are represented in social media networks in order to present our organization and our services there. The operators of these networks regularly process their users' data for advertising purposes. Among other things, they create user profiles from their online behavior, which are used, for example, to show advertising on the pages of the networks and elsewhere on the Internet that corresponds to the interests of the users. To this end, the operators of the networks store information on user behavior in cookies on the users' computers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the operators merge this information with other data. Users can obtain further information and instructions on how to object to processing by the site operators in the data protection declarations of the respective operators listed below. It is also possible that the operators or their servers are located in non-EU countries, so that they process data there. This may result in risks for users, e.g. because it is more difficult to enforce their rights or because government agencies access the data.
If users of the networks contact us via our profiles, we process the data provided to us in order to respond to the inquiries. This is our legitimate interest, so that the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.
