Great Gift for Dinosaur Loving Kids!

If you have a kid in your life who loves dinosaurs, I have the gift for you.  It's great for a variety of ages.  There are coloring pages and sticker pages.  There are 12 colored markers included and 500 stickers!  It's simply a dino lover's dream come true!  Young and older children alike will be able to entertain themselves for hours and they can use their imagination while they're at it.  The pages are slick, sleek and shiny.  The finished product is gorgeous and lots of fun.

The Dino Fun Sticker Book works great for the little ones.  So many stickers and pages to keep the kiddos entertained. They are easy to peel off and stick easily to their matching page. Some animals do not look realistic but that is the fun part about this, kids can come up with anything using this book. This sticker book + marker set is great for a little free draw station in a classroom setting or can work well for individual kids as well. Kids love stickers so this is a great find, it is on the pricer side I would say, even with the markers.

The stickers are a weird collection of out of focus photos and cartoons and mismatched themes. I guess kids don't really care...still on the expensive side. There is no carrying case for the markers which is annoying and not travel friendly. The stickers do stick and it did entertain my 3 year old for 39 minutes

My Nieces Love This & So Do I

This Dino Fun Sticker Book is great for travel and any time. The stickers are fun, colorful, and easy to peel off and stick. There are so many great stickers in this amazing book.
The Dino Fun Sticker Book comes in a lovely bright kit box. The kit arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Inside the box is the spiral-bound book, which is wonderful. It's spiral-bound, which makes the book a lot easier to use and allows you to lay the pages out flat. I love that.
It is such a well-designed kit for kids.  Everything is carefully designed to be fun but easy to use and beautiful.  I am so impressed with everything in the kit.
My niece loved this kit so much that she insisted on taking it to bed with her.  She refused to let go of it, but did let me put the coloring pens and stickers away.
Truthfully, I have been playing with it as well. The entire kit is perfect. I love the 12 coloring pens. The colors are vibrant, and the pens are easy for little hands to hold and use.  They have thick barrels, and the tops come off easily.  I especially love how evenly the ink from the pen is dispensed.  It's consistent and fluid.
There are also pages for coloring.  You can add stickers if you want.  I love the duck page the best, but all of the pages are great, and there is a wide range of topics to select from, including fashions hanging in the closet.
This kit provides many hours of activities and play for adults and kids.  Everything arrived exactly as promised, and I was thrilled.  I will be buying this again to give as a gift.  It's great even for big kids like me.  Kudos to the manufacturer.  5 Stars

I like the Dino Fun Sticker Book for Toddlers-Kids Travel Essentials-500 Stickers +14 Coloring Pages+12 Coloring Pens, with a few exceptions. The product listing says that the book "mostly" replicates the true colors of animals and everyday items, using realistic images instead of cartoons. I question the "mostly" part. There is quite  a bit of cartoonish animals. Of course, the dinosaurs are cartoonish. No one has ever seen a real dinosaur. But I posted a photo of one of the sticker pages to show how cartoonish the pig, puppy, and goat look, with their huge eyes and goofy expressions. They are not realistic at all. Then the image of the lion looks like a photograph of a stuffed toy. My guess is that stock photos were used to make this product, explaining the wide variety of styles.
Secondly, I don't think there are 26 activities and coloring. There are two activities including coloring. The children can either play with stickers on the 13 sticker pages, or they can color one of the 14 coloring pages. At least the sticker pages can be reusable, if the child is careful. The stickers are hard to pull up and put down, so they can be easily torn. But they can be lifted and moved about on the background pages. The child could be encouraged to make up a story about his sticker pages - so maybe there are three activities after all.
I do like the background pages. They are very colorful. One shows a neighborhood at night - very cartoonish in style. The coordinating stickers are all dinosaurs dressed up like people in a neighborhood. There is a chef, a fireman, a mom with a baby, an artist with an easel, one skateboarding, one with an abacus, etc.
Then there is a mountains and meadow background. The stickers include the dog, pig, and goat mentioned before, along with butterflies and more dinosaurs. The third background is under the sea, with whales, shark, octopus and all sorts of underwater life, and another dinosaur. And some land animals - not sure where they'd be under the water! They include caribou and polar bear. Another background shows a river and trees - it doesn't look like a jungle to me, but the stickers have cheetah and black bear, tiger and gorilla, and of course, a dinosaur. More backgrounds include a golden savannah, a home's backyard with a dog house, inside a bakery with stickers of food to fill the shelves, a vegetable stand, a big wall to hold dozens of clock stickers, a clothing shop, a sandy beach, a divided highway, and finally, a living room with a Christmas tree sticker.
If your child loves to play with stickers, this is a great gift. Maybe even a great travel toy, if your child knows to put stickers in the book and not all over the car.

More backgrounds include a golden savannah, a home's backyard with a dog house, inside a bakery with stickers of food to fill the shelves, a vegetable stand, a big wall to hold dozens of clock stickers, a clothing shop, a sandy beach, a divided highway, and finally, a living room with a Christmas tree sticker.
If your child loves to play with stickers, this is a great gift. Maybe even a great travel toy, if your child knows to put stickers in the book and not all over the car.

Automatic Information:
We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of
                  Amazon Services, including information about your interaction with products, content,
                  and services available through Amazon Services. Like many websites, we use "cookies"
                  and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your
                  web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf
                  of Amazon on other websites. Our physical stores may use cameras, computer vision,
                  sensors, and other technology to gather information about your activity in the store,
                  such as the products and services you interact with. Click

We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery

For What Purposes Does Amazon Use Your Personal Information?
We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products

Purchase and delivery of products and services.
We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and
                  services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services,
                  and promotional offers.
Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.
We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix
                  errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
Recommendations and personalization.
We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that
                  might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience
                  with Amazon Services.
Provide voice, image and camera services.
When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images,
                  videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested

In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws.
                  For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment
                  and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.
Communicate with you.
We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services
                  via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
Advertising.
We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products,
                  and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally
                  identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our
Interest-Based Ads
notice.
Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.
We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect
                  the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods
                  to assess and manage credit risks.
What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve
            Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about
            cookies and how we use them, please read our
Cookies Notice
.
Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not
            in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share
            customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com,
            Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
            least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions involving Third Parties:
We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                  third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                  from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                  providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                  We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                  such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                  transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions
                  with that third party.
Third-Party Service Providers:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                  mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
                  providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                  listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing
                  and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                  providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                  may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers:
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services.
                  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                  assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
                  (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                  that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                  will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Amazon and Others:
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                  to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
Conditions of Use
and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,
                  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
            you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
            not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
                  using encryption protocols and software.
We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling
                  credit card data.
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the
                  collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security
                  procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal
                  information to you.
Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and
                  loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs.
                  Click
here
for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and
                  to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password
                  for your Amazon account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign
                  off when finished using a shared computer. Click
here
for more information on how to sign off.
What About Advertising?
Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:
Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and
                  apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you
                  interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                  third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our
Interest-Based Ads
notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:
We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more
                  useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                  your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                  we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                  from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                  For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                  identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                  the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases,
                  product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier
                  and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve
                  you with more effective Amazon ads. Some ad companies also use this information to
                  serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out
                  of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going
                  to the
Your Ads Privacy Choices
page.
What Information Can I Access?
You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile
            information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your
            Account" section of the website. Click

for a list of examples that you can access.
What Choices Do I Have?

Customer Service
. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options
            as to how your information is being used.

                  (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls
                  are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change
                  your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you
                  contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.
If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in
Seller Central
, update your account information by accessing your
Seller Account Information
, and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your
Notification Preferences
.
If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the
Author Portal
and
Author Central
by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively.
If you shop in our physical stores, you can manage how certain data is used to analyze
                  the performance of our products and services, as well as learn more
here

            access to or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things,
