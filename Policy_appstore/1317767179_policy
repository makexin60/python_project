Certain of the Services allow the Customer to connect to various third party services via API or other integrations (“Linked Services”) and may contain links to other third-party websites and services.
Bright

Bright
of the Linked Services, website or policies, or any association with its operators. A Customer’s access and use of such Linked Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Linked Services.
Bright
is not responsible or liable for the contents or behaviour of any Linked Services, including without limitation, any link contained in a Linked Service (or the policies or procedures of that Linked Service), or any changes or updates to a Linked Service (or the policies or procedures of that Linked Service). By using any product, service or functionality of the Linked Services at its own option, Customer hereby acknowledges and consents that
Bright
may share Customer information and data with such Linked Services. By connecting such Linked Services, Customer agrees that it is consenting to the necessary continuous integration and information sharing about Customer and its end users to such Linked Services. Customer also hereby agrees to hold
Bright
harmless from any liability caused by such Linked Services, including but not limited to data breaches and other acts or behaviours stemming from such Linked Services. The Customer agrees to hold
Bright

Third Party Service Providers (Subprocessors)
In providing you with our Service, we may use carefully selected third party service providers (subprocessors) to help us deliver that Service to you. Such providers may be located outside the EU/UK, in which case the data will only be transferred to countries that have either been identified as providing adequate protection or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place, for example, by entering into the European’s Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses. This may require us to share your data with them. We will always take steps to ensure that the safety and security of your information is considered, implementing and maintaining necessary technical and organisational measures over each transfer of personal information, and mandating that our third parties maintain a similar level of duty and care.
These subprocessors are only permitted to use the information in accordance with our instructions and are not permitted to further transfer your data, nor permitted to use your data for their own business purposes.
Please see our list of
Subprocessors
detailing who we use, what purpose we use them for, where they store the data we share with them, and the adequacy mechanism(s) we rely on to ensure compliance with data protection requirements.
