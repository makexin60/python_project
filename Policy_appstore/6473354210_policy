Information We Collect
Through our services, we may collect both personal information that identifies you and non-personal information, which is data that cannot be directly linked to you and may include technical information such as your IP address when accessing our services and the unique identifier of your mobile device.
Personal Information
Personal information may encompass, but is not restricted to, details such as your name, email address, date of birth, and any personal photos or images you may provide. We will collect, utilize, and disclose personal information solely as explained in this Privacy Policy. It's important to note that certain non-personal information could be considered part of your personal information when combined with other data that enables your identification. However, the same information may be considered non-personal when viewed in isolation or in conjunction with other non-personal data.

Non-personal information, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you. We collect non-personal information related to your use of IEC Games, including aggregated data concerning app usage. This non-personal information may encompass details about your mobile device or computer system, such as the device type, IP address, unique mobile device identifier, Media Access Control (MAC) address, mobile device phone number, country of registration, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, time spent, search queries, time and date stamps, clickstream data, feature usage, game statistics, scores, user rankings, time spent playing our games, and other statistics.

We accept advertisements from third-party ad networks that may be displayed in our apps. We may share certain information with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and ad platforms (collectively referred to as "Advertising Entities") to create and deliver targeted ads within our apps.

Under Special Circumstances
We may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties if we believe, at our discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the rights and property of IEC Games or a third party, to ensure the safety of any individual, or to prevent or stop potentially illegal or unethical activities.
