To read Metro's Digital Services Terms of Use please
visit this page
.
Summary
At Metro we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personally identifiable information (PII) when you use wmata.com and other Metro-owned or operated online properties (referred to throughout this Privacy Policy as Metro's digital services). PII is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, address, and telephone number. This Policy only applies to Metro's digital services. You should examine the privacy policy of any other websites or services that you access from Metro's digital services.
Metro also has a separate
corporate privacy policy
that protects the privacy of individuals who are the subjects of records maintained in Metro's
s
yst
ems of records
. Please read the
explanations for general routine uses within the systems of records notices
for additional information. Similarly, if a specific service or product offered through Metro's digital services  includes additional privacy provisions, the more strict or specific provision included with that service or product will apply.
We may periodically change the terms without notice, so please check them from time to time as your continued use of the site signifies your acceptance of the terms and conditions, including changed items. If you have any questions or concerns about our digital services privacy policy, please
contact customer service
.

Geolocation
To provide location-based information for services like the Trip Planner, Metro's digital services may request that your browser or device provide us with your precise location. Your browser or device will require you to give your consent to our collection of location information. We may also aggregate anonymous location data to better understand how people are using these location-enhanced services and later improve those services.

Cookies
A cookie is information saved by your browser. When you visit our website, we may place a cookie on your browser so we can recognize your device in the future. If you return to our website later on, our servers can read that cookie to remember you from your last visit and keep track of you over time. We use these files to personalize pages, load pages faster, or allow you to conduct e-commerce more easily and to analyze anonymized data to help us understand how people interact with our site so we can make it better.

Advertising cookies
Advertising cookies (or web beacons) are used to show you content relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks, with our permission. A web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a webpage and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. They may be used to show you content relevant to you and your interests, limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. A web beacon does not contain any personal information. No PII is transmitted to the third party using the web beacon.
Please be aware that these cookies are not controlled by Metro. We do not control these,
please see their individual privacy policies for more information

Embedded content
We may also embed content from websites such as YouTube or Instagram. As a result, when you visit a page featuring such content, you may be presented with cookies in the embedded content from these third-parties. We do not control these cookies and cannot prevent these sites or domains from collecting information on your use of this content. You should check the relevant third-party website for more information about them and how to opt out. If you are not logged in to their services, they will not know who you are but may still gather anonymous usage information.

Personal Information Collected
Metro collects PII through its digital services only if you choose to provide it to us when using products and services offered. We use this information only for fulfilling your requests. We do not lease or sell your PII to outside companies. However, Metro does contract with third parties to provide you with some of the services you may request online. In order to fulfill your request, Metro may provide your PII to such contractors.
Information collected is owned by Metro and may be used to communicate with you and improve the quality and personalization of your service. PII is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and Metro will not sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from Metro's digital services for commercial marketing purposes.
If you do not supply PII for one of the purposes listed above, we make no attempt to identify you individually. Rather, we may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This information is not linked to any PII that can identify any individual person.
Metro may also use PII to provide you with Metro-related information, for example, email about upcoming events and promotions. You have the right to opt out of any service or information you receive via a single Web or email command. Instructions for doing this are included in all Metro communications.
Top
Protecting your information
We follow industry standard best practices to protect your personal information and protect your data using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you via Metro's digital services, including adherence to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI-DSS") and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), collectively known as PCI Standards.
The internet, however, is not generally a secure medium of communication and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you input via Metro's digital services or send to us via the internet.
In addition, we may be required to release PII if it is subpoenaed by a court or grand jury. We may also provide statistics based on the
information automatically collected from your visit
to federal, state, and city officials.
If you believe there is a data security or privacy issue on our digital properties, please contact
Customer Service
.

Children's Privacy
Metro does not knowingly solicit or collect PII of children under the age of 13 through its digital services. If at any time Metro learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted PII, it will take all reasonable measures necessary to remove such PII from its databases and not use such PII for any purpose except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others, or as required by law.
Top
Employment Application Information
If you fill out an application for employment, the information collected will be used by our human resources personnel only to evaluate your qualifications for the job. The information will also be shared with the manager of the hiring department. This information will not be given to anyone outside Metro.
Top
Links to Other Sites
Metro's digital services contain links to sites owned and operated by third parties that have their own privacy policies. If you have questions regarding the privacy practices of the third-party website, please review that party's privacy policy. Metro does not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of third-party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) - General Information
How to Submit a PARP Request
Privacy Policy - General Information
How to Request SmarTrip and other Records covered by WMATA's Privacy Policy
Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) - General Information
The PARP provides the general public with access to records in the custody of WMATA. It requires disclosure of WMATA records unless the records are exempt from disclosure. The PARP only provides access to existing records and does not require the creation of records to respond to a request.
To access records of general public interest on WMATA's website,

.
Back to Top
Submitting a PARP Request
Requests for records must be in writing (letter or email), and should include the requester's contact information (email address and telephone number). Requests must provide a specific description of the records being sought and limit the request to a specific timeframe or incident.
For video records, please fill out the
video request form
and submit it to the Metro Integrated Command and Communications Center (MICC) at
VideoOperationsRequest@wmata.com
. WMATA will review your video request in the ordinary course of business and process that request, if appropriate.
Please be advised, WMATA does not accept electronic service of subpoenas without prior, written approval. Additional information is provided in the legal affairs section of our
public records page
.
If you are also requesting non-video records, please submit a separate PARP Request.
PARP Requests for non-video records may be submitted via email, mail, or facsimile (fax):
By email:
PARP@wmata.com
By mail:
Office of General Counsel 7E
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
P.O. Box 44390
Washington, DC 20026-4390
Attention: PARP Administrator
By fax:
(202) 962-2550
Records Responsive to a Request
Only records in WMATA's possession and control as of the date the search for records began are responsive to a request. If there are no records available at the time of the search, WMATA will inform the requester and close the request.
Processing and Duplication Fees
The first 2 hours of search and review time are free. Thereafter, requesters are generally assessed processing fees calculated at the employees' basic rate of pay, plus an additional 50 percent to cover benefits, for the time spent responding to the request for records. If hard copy records are provided, duplication fees are waived for the first 100 pages, and if CDs or DVDs, etc. are provided, requesters will be charged associated costs of duplication.
Prepayment of fees will be required if
fees are estimated to exceed $250, or the requester has not remitted payment for a previous request for records, or was delinquent on a payment for a previous request.
For more detailed information, please refer to the PARP,

Privacy Policy - General Information
The Privacy Policy provides notice of the personal information WMATA collects and maintains, and regulates WMATA's collection, maintenance, and disclosure of such information. Not all WMATA records are subject to the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy applies only to records about an individual maintained by WMATA in a System of Records. A System of Records is a group of records under WMATA's control from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some other unique identifier, such as a SmarTrip number or a MetroAccess® registration number or WMATA employee identification number.
The Privacy Policy prohibits the disclosure of personal records contained in a System of Records without the written consent of the individual to whom the records pertain, unless a condition of disclosure is met or the release is covered by a routine use listed in the System of Records Notice (SORN) for the specific system. For a complete list of SORNs,

Submitting a Request for Personal Records
Under WMATA's Privacy Policy, individuals have the right to request:
Access to their personal records; and/or
Amendment of records that are factually inaccurate, out-of-date, or incomplete.
Requests should be sent to
:
Office of General Counsel 7E
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
P.O. Box 44390
Washington, DC 20026-4390
Attention: PARP Administrator
You may submit an electronic copy of your request to
PARP@wmata.com
.
However, prior to release of records, individuals are required to verify their identity, either by providing an original notarized request or by making an appointment to provide a government-issued photo ID and pick up the records.
The request must be clearly marked as a "Privacy Policy Request", and must contain detailed information about the specific subject of the records, including the subject's full name (including former names, if pertinent), birth date, and current address on file with WMATA. WMATA aims to respond to requests to access or amend records within 40 working days of receipt.
Duplication Fees
