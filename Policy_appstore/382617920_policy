Data Retention
As we have explained above, we process personal data for various purposes. Accordingly, we only keep personal data as long as required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected, or, in some instance, where we have other necessities to retain the personal data, for example, where required by law. We explain below the criteria used by us to determine the retention of your personal data (meaning, for how long we store it and when we delete it, aligned with the type of data and purpose of collection).
The criteria used by us to determine Viber’s retention periods are as follows:
The type of personal data and purpose of collection – unless otherwise specified, we retain data as long as it is necessary and relevant for us to achieve the purposes for which the personal data was collected. For example:
Personal data required to be retained in order to maintain your Viber account and to enable you the use of Viber Services – these types of data, including your mobile number, and phone address book, will be retained for as long as you maintain your Viber account.
Personal data you have voluntarily provided during registration or through your account – these types of data, including your photo, date of birth, email address, will be retained for as long as you maintain your Viber account.
The details of your communication with our customer support team will be stored for 10 years.
Call Detail Records (CDRs) of your free Viber calls and messaging activity are kept as a raw data for 24 months from creation. CDRs may include, for example, your phone number and device identifiers (i.e., IP address, unique device identifier).
We delete any message once delivered, or after 14 days if delivery attempts throughout this period was not successful.
If you decide to delete your Viber account, the CDRs and communications with our customer support will be retained as detailed above, and we will further retain records of financial information (with respect to Viber payment services this means KYC data, transaction and wallet related information or your hashed pin code), Viber Out usage including CDRs, purchasing subscriptions,), for the periods required under applicable laws, or as needed in accordance with our fraud monitoring program or to identify a returning user (for Viber payment services).
All other types of data related to your Viber account will be deleted, unless we are required to further retain the data, subject to the criteria detailed below. We may keep activity data on a non-identifiable basis to improve our Services. Your posts on channels and communities may remain available if you do not delete them. Please note that deletion of the App (i.e., uninstall the App from your device) will not immediately delete your account, but if you do not reinstall it within subsequent two weeks your account may be deactivated; provided however if you have Viber Credit under your Viber Out account, other time periods will apply as set forth under “Viber Credits Specifications” clause of
Viber Out Service Specific Terms

In relation to Viber payment services we store non user data as long as it is relevant to a Viber payment services user (i.e. you are the sender or a recipient in a transaction with them or as part of a promotion).

Third-Party Websites, Apps, Services and Back-Ups
Our App may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third-party website. We may also allow certain functionalities through third-party services. We are not responsible for the data collection by such third parties, and their privacy practices and polices shall govern your personal data processed by them.
Third parties’ websites, apps and services:
If you access our Services and App from any third-party website, service or other digital source, or access any third-party site or service from our Services and App, note that, your use and the personal data collected by such third parties or provided by you in connection therewith will be subject to such third party’s practices and we do not monitor, nor are responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.
We use the Google Maps API for some functions of the App, therefore the Google privacy policy
http://www.google.com/privacy.html
is incorporated herein.
Back-ups:
If you voluntarily choose to back up your Viber conversations, such back-ups are made by independent third parties and kept on your device’s service according to operating system’s (Google/ iOS) terms and policies and are no longer protected by Viber’s end-to-end encryption nor Viber has any control over it. This is also true for using Viber Desktop – where your conversations are kept on your personal computer under your security definitions.
TrueDepth APIs:
Starting the end of June 2021 we added a new face lens feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the user’s face. Some lenses can make use of TrueDepth API. TrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running. It is a very specific feature and none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment. Types of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on, which we don’t have. Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere. The data never leaves the user’s device (so cannot be, and is not, shared by Viber with third parties) and is only used for lens operation.

Binding Corporate Rules
Binding Corporate Rules
Rakuten’s global privacy framework is based in a set of internal rules referred to as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). This all-encompassing framework of internal rules is comprised of both the EU BCR and the UK BCR, which have been approved by the European Union and the United Kingdom’s respective data protection authorities. The BCRs ensure the protection of individual’s privacy and personal data throughout the Rakuten Group.
Why are the BCRs important?
The fast-moving and globalized nature of the digital sector requires a global approach to business operations, where services are available to individuals located all over the world. The Rakuten Group, as a global company, is established in several countries and its operations are the subject of a vast number of laws in multiple jurisdictions.
Some of these countries have limited or fragmented privacy rules or may lack a general privacy framework. Therefore, Rakuten relies on its BCRs as the fundamental guarantee and operational baseline for its approach to privacy and data protection.
These corporate rules assure that the level of protection offered in any country where Rakuten companies are based matches the level required by the European Union and the United Kingdom. This means that data can be transferred safely and lawfully between Rakuten Group entities.
What is the content of the BCRs?
These rules comprise the main privacy principles such as lawful processing, purpose limitation and data quality, as well as recognize the right to information, rectification, objection, and other rights as granted under the applicable privacy laws. Depending on the region where Rakuten users are based and the applicable privacy regulations, users may also enjoy additional rights.
Rakuten has appointed a Global Privacy Manager that leads Rakuten’s privacy strategy.  The Global Privacy Manager works hand in hand with Rakuten’s strong privacy network to ensure compliance with the BCRs across Rakuten Group entities, and they are responsible for mediating claims and assuring internal compliance. Most importantly, the BCRs bind all Rakuten’s worldwide entities so that each company adheres to the same rules across all their operations.
The rules also make it clear that even if personal data is transferred to a country that operates on a less stringent data protection regime, Rakuten will still apply its high global standards.
Privacy is the core value of trust for our users and stakeholders. Rakuten is very serious about maintaining global compliance to the highest standards.

Changing the data settings won't prevent you from using our services, but the content you see may be less relevant to you, and our ability to tailor our services will be reduced.
For more information on data collection and how we use the information, please refer to our
terms and policies
.
Notes
Some settings may not be available in your region.
If you are under 16 years of age you will not be able to change your personal data settings; they will automatically be switched to

.
Always use the latest version of Rakuten Viber to ensure that you have the most updated settings options.
The settings that you have on your phone are applied to your other devices as well.
Collect analytics
Analytics are collected by our trusted third-party service providers, who track how the app is used and interacted with. This data helps us improve our products and the app’s overall performance.
Allow content personalization
The app’s content, including bots, promotional campaigns, offers, and additional features and services, is tailored to you based on our first-party data, such as your age range, your location (based on your permission), your inferred gender, how you interact with content on Viber, for example, the bots you are subscribed to and the communities you joined or analytics on how you use our app such as duration, frequency, and times.
We hope to enhance your experience on Viber by offering you relevant and exciting content. If you opt out of allowing content personalization, we will still provide you with content and services across the app; however, it may not be relevant to you or you will like it less.
For more information on content personalization, please refer to our
Privacy Policy
and, if you are a user in the EEA or UK, to the
Privacy Notice for EEA and UK users
.
Allow accurate location-based services
Rakuten Viber and our trusted partners may use your accurate location to provide you localized services.
For example, it will be used to show you Viber Out promotions relevant to your area, or display stickers in the Sticker Market that reflect more relevant local content.
If you opt out of allowing accurate location-based services, you won’t be able to use certain features on Rakuten Viber, such as sharing your location with contacts.
