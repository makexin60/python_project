Legal Basis of
Processing Of Personal Data For The Purposes Of Fraud Prevention And Network and Information Security as part of Broadcom’s Services
Broadcom processes Personal Data for fraud prevention and network and information security purposes when providing Services. Pursuant to applicable privacy legislation, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent necessary and proportionate for preventing fraud and ensuring network and information security. Network and information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
As a provider of payment security services and cybersecurity technologies and services, it is in Broadcom’s legitimate interests to collect and process Personal Data to the extent necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing fraudulent payment transactions (“Fraud”) and ensuring the security of Broadcom’s customers’ payment transactions and information networks and systems. This includes the development of payment transaction records and of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis Broadcom’s ability to detect Fraud and the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events affecting information networks and systems (“Cybersecurity Threats”)..
The Personal Data Broadcom processes for the prevention of Fraud includes, but is not limited to:
Information related to electronic means of payment and related entitlements;
Information related to electronic payment transactions;
Contextual signals and indicators of suspected fraud;
Verification information to confirm or dispel suspected fraud; and
Evidence of suspected, detected and/or confirmed fraud.
The Personal Data Broadcom processes for network and information security purposes include, without limitation, network traffic data related to Cybersecurity Threats such as:
sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);
reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of Cybersecurity Threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).
Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other data subjects. In such cases Broadcom will process the Personal Data concerned only to the extent necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting and mitigating the Fraud  or Cybersecurity Threat of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on Broadcom’s products and services to secure their payment transactions and information networks and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, Broadcom will only seek to identify data subjects:
to the extent that it is an inherent part of the Services Broadcom provides to its  customers  and is indispensable to the prevention of the Fraud and/or the remediation of the Cybersecurity Threat concerned, or
if and as required by law.
If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Broadcom for such purposes, please refer to the “Your Rights” and “Contact Broadcom” sections below. Please be aware that if it is determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Broadcom because it is critical for the prevention of, or the detection, blocking or mitigation of Cybersecurity Threats, then in certain cases the legitimate interest to pursue such processing may be compelling enough to override access, objection, rectification or erasure requests related to the data concerned
Automated Individual Decision-Making And Profiling
Where Broadcom processes payment transaction security or network traffic data for the purpose of fraud prevention or network and information security, automated decisions concerning particular payment transactions or cyber events may be made. This could involve in particular assigning relative payment fraud risk, respectively cybersecurity risk scores to ongoing or recent payment transactions, information network activities or system behaviors. Such automatically assigned risk scores may be leveraged by you, by Broadcom, by Broadcom’s partners and by other customers to detect, block and mitigate the detected Fraud or Cybersecurity Threat. They could therefore result in said partners and customers blocking payment transactions they deem to be fraudulent, halting network traffic coming from or going to suspected or known malicious addresses. Such processing is not intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, Broadcom, Broadcom’s partners and Broadcom’s other customers from fraudulent payment transactions, respectively Cybersecurity Threats. Should you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of Broadcom’s Services is impacting you. In case that data controller is Broadcom, please refer to the “Your Privacy Rights” and “Contact Broadcom” sections of this Notice to raise your concerns and to seek Broadcom’s help in finding a satisfactory solution.
Processing Of Pseudonymous Data To Improve the Performance of Broadcom Hardware
Certain mobile devices equipped with a Broadcom GPS chip occasionally require querying Broadcom's geolocation assistance server. At the user’s request when launching a geolocation service on their device, the chip will transmit to Broadcom over TCP/IP the device's then current broad city level location. In response, the server will designate to the chip the then-relevant satellites to connect to. This service reduces the time needed for the chip to achieve accurate GPS location from about 15 minutes to less than 1 minute. Broadcom does not manually access, inspect, disclose, retain, correlate or reuse any of the data associated with this service. The logs related to this service only contain the dynamic IP address from which the device connected to the service, and these logs are purged on a rolling 24-hour basis. Broadcom is not in a position to identify any individual end-user based on the information involved in this service.
