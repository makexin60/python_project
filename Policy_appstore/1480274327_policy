14. California Privacy Rights
Data Privacy Rights

Right to Know
(Categories of Personal Information). You have the right to know (i) the categories of personal information we have collected from you; (ii) the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (iii) the categories of your personal information we have sold or disclosed for a business purpose; (iv) the categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and (v) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.

Submit a Privacy Request
.
To submit a privacy request, you may contact us using the “Contact Us” section below. An authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State to conduct business in California.
Privacy Request Verification Process
.
If you (or your authorized agent) make any request related to your personal information, the Company will ascertain your identity (and the identity of the authorized agent, to the extent applicable) to the degree of certainty required or permitted under the law before addressing your request. In particular, the Company will, to the extent required or permitted by law, require you (or your authorized agent) to verify your request via email, request certain contact information or government identifiers, and we will match at least two pieces of such personal information with data that we have previously collected from you before granting you access to, erasing, or correcting, specific pieces or categories of personal information, or otherwise responding to your request. We may require written documentation that demonstrates a third party is authorized to serve as your agent for the purposes of submitting the requests set forth herein, unless you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code §§ 4121 to 4130. None of the CCPA’s rights are absolute, and such rights are subject to legal and regulatory exceptions and exemptions. For more information about the CCPA, please see
https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa
.
Opt-Out Rights / Do Not Sell My Personal Information
.
California residents have the right to opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. However, the Company does not sell your personal information to third parties for profit or monetary or other valuable consideration, and therefore we do not provide opt-out request processes for the sale of personal information (because we do not undertake such activities).
Opt-Out Rights / Do Not Share My Personal Information
.
California residents have the right to opt out of the “sharing” of their personal information. The Company uses third-party analytical and targeted advertising features on our Site and similar web tools provided by our marketing partners, and such features, tools and marketing relationships involve the disclosure of your personal information to third parties and may constitute the “sharing” of your personal information for CCPA purposes. To opt out of this sharing of your personal information in these circumstances, please click on the cookie management tool (sometimes visible as a “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the Site) to set your cookie preferences.  You, or your authorized agent, may also contact us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section listed below.
Children
.
The Site is not directed at, and should not be used by, minors under the age of sixteen (16), and therefore the Company does not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under sixteen (16) years of age.
Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information
.
The Company does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for reasons other than those set forth in the CCPA, and therefore we do not provide individuals with the ability to limit how we use or disclose such sensitive personal information.
California “Shine the Light”
.
Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”), California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of personal information, as defined under Shine the Light, such as name, email address, and mailing address, and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties; however, we do not disclose personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
15. Colorado Privacy Rights

. To submit a CPA privacy request, please contact us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below. If you would prefer, you may designate an authorized agent to submit a CPA privacy request on your behalf.
Privacy Request Verification Process.
If you make any request related to your personal information, Company will ascertain your identity (and the identity of the authorized agent, to the extent applicable) to the degree of certainty required or permitted under the law before addressing your request. In particular, before granting you access to, erasing, or correcting, specific pieces or categories of personal information or otherwise responding to your request, Company will, to the extent required or permitted by law, (i) require you (or your authorized agent) to verify your request via email, (ii) request certain contact information or government identifiers, and (iii) match at least two pieces of such personal information with data that we have previously collected from you.
