The OTPManager software does not collect or store any user data.
We don't track you, we don't profile you, period.
OTPManager is a security utility application, we have no infrastructure to collect or store user information, we do not 'phone home' or make contact with any third party. Doing any of that goes agains everything OTPManager stands for.
However, there are two exceptions:
If you voluntarily send us an e-mail, we will have your e-mail address. E-mail addresses are only used for one-on-one communication with the sender of the email and under no circumstance will it be shared, disclosed or sold to any party.
The OTPManager software uses the Apple iCloud platform for change event notifications to other connected devices (if applicable), it is therefor implied that you have read the Apple Privacy Policy and have accepted their EULA.
