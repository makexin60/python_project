Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us
Introduction
This is the privacy policy for DC Thomson & Co. Ltd and the companies and brands that form part of the DC Thomson group (
“DC Thomson”
).   It explains how we use your personal information when you give it to us, or when we collect it from you as you interact with our brands.
When we say “
we
” or “
us
” in this policy, we’re referring to companies and brands that are part of DC Thomson.  Each of our companies is what is known under data protection law as a ‘data controller’.  This means each company is responsible for processing your personal information in a lawful manner – and where more than one of our companies is involved, they’re jointly responsible. If you have any questions about how your we use your personal information or wish to exercise any of your rights, then you should use the contact details below.
To make it easier for you to understand how we use your personal information, we’ve created a single policy to cover our companies and brands.  Our
brands page
contains information about many of these.  We also have a single point of contact for any questions that you may have in relation to our use of your personal information.
Some brands within DC Thomson have their own separate privacy policies. These include:
Beano.com
Fifth Ring
Brightsolid
Findmypast
Where one of our brands has its own privacy policy, or uses a supplemental privacy policy, then we’ll let you know about that at the time we collect that information from you.
What Personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

How we obtain your personal information
We collect your personal information directly from you when you take out a newspaper, magazine, digital or app subscription. Sometimes we get your details from a friend, relative or your employer if your subscription has been purchased as a gift or on your behalf.  We also analyse how you interact with us, for example when you visit one of our websites or get in touch with a query.
We may obtain your personal information from third parties who process subscription offers, such as
i
subscribe or magazine.co.uk.
We also obtain some limited information from the app stores you have downloaded our app from. For example, order/purchase history including in app purchase details. We do not receive any payment card details; this is wholly held by the app stores.
Where we need your personal information to enter into or perform a contract with you then if you don’t provide it, we may not be able to process your subscription. For example, if you have requested a printed subscription but you don’t give us the delivery address, we won’t be able to send the newspaper or magazine.

How we obtain your personal information
We collect your personal information directly from you when you contact us, make a purchase and/or register for an online account. Sometimes we get your details from a friend or relative if they’ve nominated you to take part in a feature we’re running or placed a request for you. We also analyse how you interact with us, for example when you visit one of our websites or contact us about something.
We may obtain your personal information from third parties who have referred you to us and who have your consent to transfer your personal data to us.
Where we need your personal information to enter into or perform a contract with you then if you don’t provide it, we won’t be able to process your order or register your account. For example, if you don’t give us a delivery address if you win a physical competition prize, we won’t be able to deliver the prize.
Sharing your personal information with other organisations
As well as using your personal information across DC Thomson, we also share your personal information with other organisations:
Service providers
: We may share your personal information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf or for your benefit, such as payment processors, credit referencing providers, third party sales processor (includes fulfilment services), service providers that host our technical infrastructure and those who assist us with hosting and/or delivering our marketing campaigns.
Professional advisors

Business transfers
: Your personal information may be disclosed as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of company assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. It may also be disclosed to an administrator or liquidator or other insolvency professional if we enter financial difficulties so that they can continue to run the business, transfer it to another organisation or wind it up.
HM Revenue and Customs, regulators and other authorities:
We may share your personal information with HMRC and other regulators or authorities in the UK where required to do so by law.
Providers of competition prizes

Where we pass your personal information to a third-party service provider, that service provider will usually be a processor, processing your personal information on our instructions. This privacy policy will continue to apply, because we will remain in control of your personal information and be responsible for looking after it.
In some cases, a service provider will be a data controller in their own right with their own privacy policy, which they will make available to you in accordance with their obligations under data protection law.

We only keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may keep it for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there’s a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
If you’d like more information on how long we keep your personal information, please contact us – see the ‘How to contact us’ section below.
Your marketing preferences
You can change your marketing preferences at any time and how you do this will depend on how you interact with us (for example, whether you subscribe to one of our newspapers or have bought something from one of our online shops).
You can opt out of marketing whenever you wish, but please note this won’t affect any service messages that we need to send you in relation to any products or services you purchase or events you attend. For example, we’ll still send you communications with information about an event that you’ve registered to attend or to tell you about a change in the price of your magazine subscription.
We won’t share your personal information with anyone else for marketing purposes unless you’ve told us you agree to that.
Sending your personal information outside of the UK
We may transfer your personal information within DC Thomson and/or to third parties – see
Sharing your personal information with third
parties
– which may involve your personal information being transferred to, stored, or processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected.
If we do so, we’ll comply with applicable law regarding such transfers. Where such transfers require appropriate or suitable safeguards recognised under privacy laws, we may rely on them. Typically, these may include:
Adequacy decision:
We may transfer your personal information to countries which the Information Commissioner’s Office has approved as providing adequate protection to personal information (for example, the European Economic Area).
Approved contracts:
We may be entitled to put in place a contract with the recipient of your information which requires them to protect that information to the same standards as if the information were being processed within the country where it was collected.
With your consent:
In respect of certain transfers, we’ll obtain your consent to transfer your personal information outside the UK after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer
The safeguards we use will depend on where the recipient of the personal information is based, what they are doing, and the personal information being transferred.
You can request more information by contacting us.
Your rights
Under data protection law, you have the following rights:
A right to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and information about how we use it
The right to update any of the personal information we hold about you if it is no longer correct
The right to require us to delete or remove your personal information
The right to require us to stop processing some of your personal information for a particular reason
The right to withdraw any consent you have provided
The right, in certain circumstances, to require us to transfer your personal information to another company
These rights are qualified. This means that depending on what you ask us to do, we may not be able to comply with your request. If that is the case, we’ll explain why.
Before we can act, we may also ask you to confirm your identity so we can be sure we’re speaking to the right person. We won’t usually ask you to pay any money to exercise any of these rights, but we’ll tell you at the time if a fee will apply.
How to contact us
If you want to exercise any of your rights, change any of your choices about how we use your personal information or just ask us a question, please email us at
privacy@dcthomson.co.uk
.
If you’re unhappy about how we’ve handled your personal information, you can make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Information on how to do this is available at
www.ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint
