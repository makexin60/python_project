Please contact us if you want to know which data we hold about you or if you want your data to be corrected or deleted.
What kind of data?
We capture certain data categories, which derive from your use of our Service. Some of these are technical necessary to provide you with this Service or are used for anonymous statistical analysis to improve the Service, prevent threats and fix bugs, which represents a legitimate interest under the GDPR. These data categories include IP-Address, Device Specific ID, Device Information, Crash Reports and aggregated usage data. For certain functionality we might require further personal data. In this case you will be explicitly asked for it. Please see the individual third party sections for detailed data usage information and how you can deactivate it. You can also deactivate respective data usage in this app settings.
IP-Address
An IP-Address is necessary for every server to provide data to you. Some third parties use it to maintain system security and stability and to derive a coarse location (e.g. city). As an IP-Address could potentially be associated to your person, we try to avoid saving it if possible or reduce the retention period to the minimum. We furthermore try to anonymize your IP-Address, if possible.
Device Specific ID
A Device Specific ID is a random code generated on your device and enables attribution across multiple apps. We use it to personalize the ads we serve or to gather advanced statistical data. It's easy to reset or deactivate the Device Specific ID. An attribution to your data is not possible anymore as a result.

App Specific ID
An App Specific ID is a random code generated by us on your device and enables attribution across multiple sessions. We use it to gather advanced statistical data and to improve the Service for you. As Jaysquared does not associate any personal data with is and no other application has access to this ID, it can't be used to identify a person.
