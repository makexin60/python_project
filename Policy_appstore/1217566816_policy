datacolorchina.cn (and it’s sub-domains)
We take the protection of personal data very seriously. Personal data in this sense refers to all information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
For data collection, data processing and data usage, we ensure appropriate security and observe the provisions of the applicable law, and as the case may be the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992 or the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
Find out in this Privacy Policy what information and data we collect, how we use it and with whom we may share it when you visit and/or use any website(s) or mobile site(s) provided by us (individually or collectively, “Website(s)”).

Datacolor shares the personal data collected in the context of product and service information within the group. Please find here
a list of Datacolor entities worldwide
. Furthermore, Datacolor may share information required for the performance of a contract within its group worldwide. This may cause data collected to be disclosed or transferred to Datacolor employees in countries deemed to have no adequate data protection legislation in the view of the European Union (“EU”) and/or Switzerland. In cases this takes place, Datacolor however has implemented adequate guarantees to ensure adequate protection of the personal data. We are evaluating international transfers on a case-by-case basis to implement supplementary measures, where appropriate, that may have a contractual, technical or organizational nature to ensure that adequate protection of personal data is in place. You may request more information in this respect by sending an e-mail to
privacy@datacolor.com

Please, read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we handle your data. If at any time you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website(s) and our services or the App.

The collection and processing of this data are carried out for the purpose of enabling the use of our website (establishing a connection), ensuring system security and stability over the long term and optimising our internet offering as well as for internal statistical purposes. It is within our legitimate interest to process such data in order to be able to continuously provide you with an exceptional offer (article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
3.5.1. Cookies
To optimize our web presence, we use cookies. These are small text files stored in your computer. In general, these cookies are deleted after you close the browser.
Cookies may either be “permanent/persistent” cookies or “transient/session” cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on your device while session cookies are deleted when you leave the Website(s).
We use both session and persistent Cookies for the purposes set out below:
Essential cookies
Type: Session cookies
       Administered by: us
       Purpose and legal basis: We require these cookies to provide you with our services. Without the use of these cookies we are unable to provide you our services through the Website(s).

You can prevent storage of cookies by choosing a “disable cookies” option in your browser settings. But this can limit the functionality of our Website(s).
Furthermore, we use a cookie consent banner to obtain your consent to the use of certain cookies in your browser and for the data privacy compliant documentation as required (article 6(1)(a) GDPR).

This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory retention obligations as may be applicable (see section 5.1 below).
3.5.2. Clear gif files (Web Beacons)
Our service sometimes uses a software technology known as clear gif files (i.e. web beacons) to help us improve managing the contents and user interaction by telling us which contents are effective. Clear gif files are tiny graphics with a unique label that work in a similar way to cookies and are used to monitor the user’s online activities. In contrast to cookies that are saved on a user’s computer hard disk, clear gif files are embedded invisibly in websites and are about as big as the full stop at the end of this sentence. Where appropriate, we combine the information collected by the clear gif files with the data of our customers.
3.5.3. Server-Log Files
The Internet provider of the Website(s) and our App automatically store information that your browser submits to the server in – so called – server-log files. This information includes:
Browser Type / Browser Version
your operating system/operating system version
Device type
Referrer URL
Hostname and IP address of your computer
Name of the device
Date and time of the request
Webpage you are accessing
Configuration of the App when using our services
A combination of this data with other data sources is not made. This data processing is carried out in accordance with article 6(1)(f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in providing the stability and functionality of our Website(s) and the App. We reserve the right to analyse these data in case of concrete evidence of unlawful use.
3.5.4. Google Analytics
The Website(s) use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Analytics uses cookies, i.e. text files stored on your computer to enable analysis of website usage by you. Information generated by the cookie about your use of this Website(s) may be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. In case of activated IP anonymization on this Website(s), however, your IP address is previously truncated by Google within Switzerland, member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf this Website’s owner, i.e. Datacolor, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Website(s), compile reports about Website(s) activities, and provide the Websites’ operator, i.e. Datacolor, with further services related to Website(s) and Internet usage. The IP address sent from your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you might not be able to fully use all functions offered by this Website(s).
In addition, you can prevent data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the Website(s) (including your IP address) from being collected and processed by Google, by downloading and installing a browser plug-in from the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. This plug-in informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that data and information about website visits must not be transmitted to Google Analytics.
Furthermore, cookies set by Google Analytics may at all time be deleted via the browser. Additional information on Google’s privacy regulations including Google’s implementation of the EU/US privacy shield, are available under https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.
3.5.5. Google Analytics Remarketing
The Website(s) use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in combination with the functions of Google Ads and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices. The provider of these solutions is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
This function makes it possible to connect the advertising target groups generated with Google Analytics Remarketing with the functions of Google Ads and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices. This makes it possible to display interest-based customized advertising messages, depending on your prior usage and browsing patterns on a device (e.g. cell phone) in a manner tailored to you as well as on any of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given us pertinent consent (article 6(1)(a) GDPR), Google will connect your web and app browser progressions with your Google account for this purpose. As a result, it is possible to display the same personalized advertising messages on every device you log into with your Google account.
To support this function, Google Analytics records Google authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily connected with our Google Analytics data to define and compile the target groups for the ads to be displayed on all devices.
You can configure your browser to reject cookies. Furthermore, you have the option to permanently object to remarketing/targeting across all devices by deactivating personalized advertising. To do this, please follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ .
The consolidation of the recorded data in your Google account shall occur exclusively based on your consent, which you may give to Google and also revoke there (article 6(1)(a) GDPR). Also, data recording processes that are not consolidated in your Google account (for instance because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the consolidation of data), the recording of data is based on article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
For further information and the pertinent data protection regulations, please consult the data privacy policies of Google at: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en and https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.
3.5.6. Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online promotional program of Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
In conjunction with Google Ads, we use a tool called Conversion Tracking. If you click on an ad posted by Google, a cookie for Conversion Tracking purposes will be placed. Cookies are small text files the web browser places on the user’s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we will be able to recognise that the user has clicked on an ad and has been linked to this page.
A different cookie is allocated to every Google Ads customer. These cookies cannot be tracked via websites of Google Ads customers. The information obtained with the assistance of the Conversion cookie is used to generate Conversion statistics for Google Ads customers who have opted to use Conversion Tracking. The users receive the total number of users that have clicked on their ads and have been linked to a page equipped with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would allow them to personally identify these users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you have the option to object to this use by deactivating the Google Conversion Tracking cookie via your web browser under user settings. If you do this, you will not be included in the Conversion Tracking statistics.
The storage of “Conversion” cookies and the use of this tracking tool are based on your consent pursuant to article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time.
To review more detailed information about Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking, please consult the Data Privacy Policies of Google at: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.
You can set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified anytime cookies are placed and you can permit cookies only in certain cases or exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain instances or in general and you can also activate the automatic deletion of cookies upon closing of the browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functions of this website may be limited.
3.5.7. Facebook Visitor Action Pixel
The Website(s) use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Inc (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”)) on our Website(s). This allows user behaviour to be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes.
The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s privacy policy accessible under: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
You can allow Facebook and its partners to place ads on and off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes. The legal basis for the use of this service is your consent (article 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads by contacting the following address: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. Facebook participates in the Privacy Shield Agreement adhering to Privacy Shield Principles that support compliance with European data protection legislation (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacyshield) (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active).
3.5.8. LinkedIn Insight Tag
The Website(s) use the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” of LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 W Maude Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA (“LinkedIn”). It helps us with insights about our Website visitors. It can also be used to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our ads on LinkedIn.
The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to our Website(s), including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (user agent), and timestamp. This data is encrypted, the IP addresses are truncated, and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 90 days.
LinkedIn does not share personal data with us, it only provides aggregated reports about the Website audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling us to show personalized ads off our Website(s) by using this data, but without identifying the member. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.
All this in accordance with LinkedIn terms (https://www.linkedin.com/legal/sas-terms#additional-terms-for-optional-conversion-tracking) and cookie policies (https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy).
3.5.9. Personal data automatically collected when using the App
When using our App, we automatically collect certain data required to ensure the usability of the App. In particular:
the internal ID of your device;
the version of your operating system;
the time of access;
Colors you measured (if you decided to share the data with us);
Geolocation (if you decided to share the data with us).
The collection and processing of this data is carried out for the purpose of enabling the use of our App (establishing a connection), ensuring system security and stability over the long term and ensuring a customer friendly use of our App as well as internal statistical purposes. The processing of this personal data is within our legitimate interest to ensure a functioning service (article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
The internal ID of your device may also be evaluated together with other data in the event of attacks on the network infrastructure or other unauthorised or abusive use of the App, the Website(s) and associated backend servers for the purpose of clarification and defence and, if necessary, used within the framework of criminal proceedings for identification and for civil and criminal action against the users concerned. The processing of this information is in our legitimate interest (article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
3.6. Opt out possibilities from e-mail communications
You may opt out of:

receiving promotional e-mail communications and newsletters by e-mailing us at privacy@datacolor.com. Please allow up to ten (10) business days for changes to your e-mail preferences to take effect. During that time, you may continue to receive e-mail communications from us that were already in process. Opting out of receiving Website(s) communications will not affect your receipt of service-related communications such as payment confirmations.
We strive to keep your data private and safe. We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security of data collected, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Datacolor uses technical and organizational security precautions to protect personal data against manipulation, loss, accidental or unlawful destruction or against access by unauthorized persons or unauthorized disclosure. Our security precautions are regularly improved in line with technological development. In particular, it is our policy to never send your credit card number via e-mail. Any payment transactions will be encrypted and e-mail is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information, so please do not send us your credit card number by e-mail.
If you ever use a public computer to access the Website(s) or the App account, we strongly encourage you to log out at the conclusion of your session. By doing so, although your information may still be stored with us, it should not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.
Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we will use reasonable means to ensure the security of information you transmit through the Website(s) or the App, any transmission of data is at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties and we shall not be liable for any breach of the security of your data resulting from causes or events that are beyond our control, including, without limitation, your own act or omission, corruption of storage media, defects in third-party data security products or services, power failures, natural phenomena, riots, acts of vandalism, hacking, sabotage, or terrorism and we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website(s) or in the App.
5.1. Storage of data
We only store data for as long as is necessary for the above described uses and further processing in the context of our legitimate interest. Contract data is stored by us for a longer period of time, as this is prescribed by statutory obligations. Obligations to store data may arise out of accounting law, civil law and tax law. According to these laws, business communication, concluded contracts and accounting vouchers must be stored for up to 10 years. If we no longer need this data to carry out the services for you, the data will be blocked. This means that the data may then only be used for accounting and tax purposes.
5.2. General information about the exchange of data with third parties
We may also disclose your data to outside parties who help us deliver you the products and services we offer; create, operate, and maintain the Website(s) and the App; and with specialised services such as payment processing, shipping, mail and e-mail distribution, mobile messaging, Website(s) and App hosting, monitoring, analytics, sweepstakes and promotions management, survey and mobile payment processing. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services.
We also work with third parties, such as ad networks, analytics companies and social networking platforms, and they may collect information about your online activities over time and across our sites and other online services. We require that these outside individuals and/or companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. We may also contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to data.
The privacy policies and data practices of such third parties may significantly differ from ours, and we make no representation or warranty whatsoever about their policies and practices. Your communications and interactions with such third parties are solely between you and them, and are at your own risk.
If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment and aggregated data analysis.

In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your data will likely be among the assets shared or transferred. If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your information will be subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the transfer or sharing of such information.
5.3. Advertisement by third parties
Ads appearing on the Website(s) may be delivered to users by Datacolor or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Datacolor and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. For detailed information on cookies used for the Website(s) see section 3.5.1.

5.5. Integration of other third-party services and content
It is possible for third-party contents, such as videos on YouTube, Marketo, GoToMeeting and Amazon Web Services (AWS) or contents from other websites to be integrated on the Website(s). This always presumes that the providers of such content (referred to hereinafter as “third-party providers”) can see the IP addresses of the users. Without the IP address, they could not send the contents to the respective user’s device. The IP address is therefore necessary in order to show these contents. We endeavour to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address merely to supply the contents. However, Datacolor has no influence on whether the third-party providers save the IP address e.g. for statistical purposes.
For the purposes of extended usage, some third-party providers (e.g. YouTube operated by Google, GoToMeeting operated by LogMeIn Ireland Limited and Marketo, Inc) demand the disclosure also of further personal data, including the user’s name and e-mail address. Without disclosing such personal data, these external services could not be used at all or only to a limited extent.
You can find more information about the use of personal data by Google (YouTube) on the following website: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en

The general privacy notice of Klarna Bank AB (publ) can be viewed under https://www.klarna.com/ after choosing the relevant country and then selecting the link privacy notice (or the equivalent term in another language) at the bottom of the website.
The legal basis for the sharing of your data between SOFORT GmbH and us is article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent) as well as article 6(1)(b) GDPR (processing for the fulfilment of a contract). You have the option to at any time revoke your consent to the processing of your data. Such a revocation shall not have any impact on the effectiveness of data processing transactions that occurred in the past.
7.1. General information
We will only transfer your personal data to third parties (contracted service providers) abroad for the purpose of the data processing described in this Privacy Policy. These are bound to protect data to the same extent as we are. If the level of data protection in a country does not correspond to that in Switzerland, the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will endeavour to contractually ensure that the protection of your personal data corresponds to that in Switzerland, the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) at all times.
7.2. Transfer of data to the USA
For the sake of completeness, for users residing or domiciled in Switzerland, the EU and the European Economic Area, we would like to point out that in the USA there are surveillance measures by US authorities which generally allow them to get access to all personal data that has been transferred from Switzerland, the EU and the EEA to the USA. This is done without differentiation, limitation or exception based on the objective pursued and without any objective criterion that would allow limiting the access to the data and subsequent use thereof by US authorities to very specific, strictly limited purposes that could justify the interference associated both with access to and use of such data. In addition, we would like to point out that in the USA there are no legal remedies available for the persons concerned from Switzerland, the EU or the EEA that would allow them to gain access to the data concerning them and to obtain its correction or deletion, or that there is no effective legal protection against general access rights of US authorities. We explicitly draw your attention to this legal and factual situation in order to enable an informed decision to consent to the use of your data.
We would like to point out to users residing in Switzerland, an EU and/or EEA member state that, from the point of view of Switzerland and the EU, the USA does not have an adequate level of data protection, partly due to the issues mentioned in this section. Insofar as we have explained in this Privacy Policy that recipients of data (such as Google) are based in the USA, we will endeavour to ensure that your data is protected at an appropriate level by our service providers, either through contractual arrangements with these companies or by ensuring that these companies are certified under, and comply with the requirements of, the EU or Swiss-US Privacy Shield. Datacolor will endeavour to limit the transfer of personal data to the USA to the extent that this is possible.
You can withdraw your consent with respect to giving us the right to use and process your data for advertising and newsletters as well as any other processing of your data by us which is based on your consent without giving any reasons. In this case please send a message to privacy@datacolor.com. After receiving your request, we will no longer use the data unless there is another legal basis for processing (e.g. for processing ongoing orders based on article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
You have a right to request information about the personal data that we store about you. In addition, you have a right to correct incorrect data and a right to request deletion of your personal data, insofar as there is no legal obligation to retain such data and no legal basis for further processing the existing data.
Depending on the applicable law, you also have a right to request the data that you have provided to us (right to data portability). Upon request, we will transfer your data to a third party of your choice. You have a right to receive the data in a common file format.
You can contact us for the aforementioned purposes via the e-mail address privacy@datacolor.com. In order to process your requests, we may request proof of your identity.
In many countries, you also have the right to file a complaint with the relevant data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your data.
These rights depend on the applicable data protection legislation and may be either more limited or more comprehensive.
9.1. International user notice
For international users, please note that it may be necessary to transfer your information internationally and, in particular, your information may be transferred to and processed in the USA. For residents of the EU — the data protection and other laws of other countries outside of the EU may not be as comprehensive as those of the EU. Please be assured that we endeavour to ensure that your privacy is protected as described in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website(s) or the App, you agree to have your information used and transferred to the USA as set forth in this policy.
