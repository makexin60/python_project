Privacy Policy
Nutpan Pty Ltd (ABN 35 165 720 258) (“JDoodle”, “we”, “us” and “our”) understands that your privacy is paramount, and are committed to protecting your privacy. Accordingly, we have developed this policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information.
We may modify this privacy policy from time to time. We will display a notice on our website indicating when any such material revisions have been made. This privacy policy was last updated on 14 February 2024.
Collection of personal information
Personal information is information or an opinion about an individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether true or not and whether recorded in material form or not. We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
We may collect personal information from you when you:
subscribe to our products and services, or when someone subscribes to our products and services on your behalf or where you receive the benefit of a subscription (for example, if you are a student at a school who has subscribed to our products, when a teacher allocates assignments to students);
visit our website or our social media sites;
contact us by any method, such as telephone, email, post, or via a social media site;
attend events or conferences that we organise or events and conferences organised by other entities that we sponsor, including webinars, or as notified to you from time to time.
The personal information you provide to us may vary depending on the nature of your interaction with us but may, for example, include your name and contact details, such as your email, phone number, and address, and the nature of your business.
Our web servers may automatically collect information when you visit our website, including:
your IP address;
the date and time of your visit;
the parts of our website you access during your visit;
your actions on our website; and
the browser you are using.
In using our websites, your personal information may be collected through the use of cookies. These are small text files placed on your mobile device or computer by our websites which automatically collect information about you without you providing that information to us directly. Most browsers are set by default to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to either prompt you whether you wish to accept cookies on a particular site, or by default reject cookies.
Please note that rejecting cookies may mean that some or all of the functions on our website will not be available to you.
Further, we use external service providers, such as Google Analytics, to analyse traffic on our website and improve the products and services provided by us. Generally, information collected through such analysis is anonymous. Google Analytics collects information about your use of our site by using cookies to analyse a (anonymous) user’s behaviour and generating what type of users visit a webpage and what a user does once they get there. The information generated by cookies about your use of our website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers globally, including in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Further information about how Google Analytics uses information collected from sites that use Google Analytics can be found on
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
.
If you don’t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the
‘Google Analytics browser add-on’
, provided by Google.
Additionally, we partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our website through behavioural metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization and fraud/security purposes. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the
Microsoft Privacy Statement
.
Sometimes our website contains links to other websites. When you access a website other than our website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each website you visit.
Using your personal information
Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected. We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
The personal information that we collect is used to provide our products and services to you. Personal information collected by us may also be used for the following purposes:
to provide you with information and marketing in relation to the products and services we provide, including in relation to special promotions or offers conducted by us;
to track your usage of our website in order to provide our products and services, such as required access to the appropriate plans, as well as to improve the functionality of the website;
to keep track of your account settings if you’re a subscriber;
to respond to your questions or suggestions;
to meet and improve the quality and performance of our products and services;
to improve the quality of your visit to our website.
Sharing your personal information
We may disclose your personal information to:
our service providers who assist us to provide you with our products and services,
or to conduct our business; persons that you authorise us to make disclosures to;
and other persons as required or authorised by law.
We primarily store your personal information in Australia and in the United States. We may also disclose your personal information to third party service providers that are located outside Australia, including in Europe, India, and Singapore.
Accessing and correcting your personal information
We will, on request, provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you, including for the purpose of correcting or updating that personal information, unless there is an exception to such disclosure which applies under relevant privacy legislation. If you require access to your personal information, please contact us at the contact details set out below.
For most requests, your information will be provided free of charge, however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request requires a substantial effort on our part.
If we refuse to provide you with access to the information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the Australian Privacy Principles (unless it would be unreasonable to do so).
We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete, irrelevant or out-of-date, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to either correct this information, or if necessary, discuss alternative action with you.
Protecting your personal information
We are committed to protecting your personal information. We will take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
Change of policy
We may modify this privacy policy from time to time. We will display a notice on our website for a reasonable period after such revisions have been made. We will keep the current version of this privacy policy on our website.
Contact information and complaints
