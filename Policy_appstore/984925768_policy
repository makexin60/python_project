Disclosures of your personal data
Access by Teamwork.com
Personnel
. We allow access to personal data only to those of our employees, and consultants who have a need to access the information for a lawful purpose. We train our employees how to appropriately handle personal data and require that consultants do likewise.
Access by other third parties
. Our third party service providers who provide us with customer relationship management services, websites maintenance, database and cloud, customer support, customer analytics, payment processing, payroll and benefits management services have access to your personal data. Our contracts with these third party providers only allow use of your information to provide these services and require that they not disclose it unless required in special circumstances, like those described in the following paragraph. We review the security policies and practices of our third party service providers as appropriate as part of our own efforts to maintain the security of your information.
Law Enforcement, Court Orders and Protection of Our Rights
. We may disclose any of your information to government officials as necessary to comply with applicable laws and orders. If we receive a request to disclose any such information, we may do so if we believe in our reasonable discretion that such request is lawful and that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply. We may also disclose your personal data to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law, court order or government instruction.   Please see section 4 above.
Affiliates
. We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about you to our Affiliates. Our "Affiliates" are any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Teamwork.com, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this privacy notice.
Other Disclosures
. We may also disclose your information if we believe it is necessary in order to protect our property rights or rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or of the public or to prevent any activity that we believe is harmful, illegal or unethical. For example, we may need to use personal data in order to enforce our Terms of Service with customers, or to engage in other business or corporate transactions. We will put in place appropriate security measures, such as non-disclosure agreements, whenever possible. See further section 4 above.
International transfers
The Teamwork.com Data Processing Agreement includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as the mechanism to transfer data from the EU to the US.
Certain elements of our services are hosted in the United States and in the EU, and your data may be transferred to the United States, in addition, our staff in the EU, EEA or UK share limited information with Teamwork.com in the United States. This may include your contact information, to coordinate sales and marketing activities, and to make sure that you are interacting with the correct Teamwork.com entity and business function. If you apply for a position with any Teamwork.com entity, generally, your information will stay in the country where you apply, although some data may be shared with our Teamwork.com entity in the US. There is no adequacy decision in place in respect of the US.
Data security
Security
: We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need-to-know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We use industry-standard measures to safeguard all data and have a continuous process in place to test the effectiveness of these measures and to review the threat landscape and new tools available. You have a role to play in security as well, and we ask that you use prudent measures to protect against unauthorised access to your account information, including logging out of your account when finished, not sharing your login information and taking other customary security precautions appropriate for the situation. The type of organisational or technical measures we use to secure our systems and data may differ depending on the sensitivity of the data and our assessment of how accidental or unauthorised disclosure or use of the data could threaten the rights and freedoms of natural persons. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
Phishing
. We are aware that there are people who may pose as legitimate businesses and try to trick you into disclosing personal information that can be used to steal your identity. We will not request your account login or password, your credit card information or any sensitive data that could be used to steal your identity, such as national identifying numbers, in an unsolicited or non-secure email or telephone call. If you believe that someone representing themselves as being associated with Teamwork.com has requested this information in a contact that you did not request or initiate, please contact us immediately at
privacy@teamwork.com
so that we may verify the identity of the person contacting you and the validity of the request.
Special Laws
. You must not store on our Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) or otherwise submit to the Services any (i) protected health information subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, (ii) Special Categories of Personal Data or (iii) save to the extent required to pay for the Services, credit, debit or other payment card data subject to PCI DSS or any other credit card schemes or other data which requires, (iv) data similar to (i)-(iii) or (v) data which requires  special protection pursuant to applicable law. If you pay us by credit card, we and our payment processors protect your payment information in accordance with local laws establishing standards for payment card information.
Data retention
We and our third party processors will keep personal data in our active operating systems only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of providing services to you or a customer, satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Opting out
:
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.  Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a Service purchase, warranty registration, Service experience or other transactions.
Request restriction
of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party
. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent
at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Contact Us
If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at privacy@teamwork.com with your request. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.  We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
You have the right to make a
complaint
to a data protection supervisory authority at any time.  The Data Protection Commission ("
DPC
") is the Irish supervisory authority and can be contacted at info@dataprotection.ie. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the DPC or another data protection supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance.
