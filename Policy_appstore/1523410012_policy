4.2. Legal Obligations
We may share any Personal Data that we collect with third parties in conjunction with any of the activities set forth under “Meeting Legal Requirements and Enforcing Legal Terms” in the
“Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data” section
above.
4.3. Business Transfers
All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.
4.4. Data that is Not Personal Data
As described in
Section 3.3 (Creating De-identified or Aggregated Data)
above, we may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data (e.g. Commercial Data and Consumer Demographic Data) we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our and their lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, to research and develop new products and services, generate analytics or reports, facilitate researches or studies, and gain consumer insights or other business intelligence, to optimize marketing efficiency, or for other legitimate business purposes.
4.4.1. Sharing with Measurable AI:
Specifically, we share aggregated or de-identified data based on your Personal Data with
Measurable AI
, an enterprise-facing database and platform that provides alternative data (that doesn’t include any Personal Data) to enable its subscribers to use, review, analyze such data to gain consumer insights, industry developments, market trends, marketing optimization, and other business intelligence. For example, we (through MailTime) scan and identify purchase receipts from Commercial Messages collected from your email account linked to the Services, aggregate such de-identified information with other de-identified information from our other users of the Services to create de-identified and/or aggregated data, which will become part of the database or data feeds we provide to Measurable AI.
We adopt the following measures designed to ensure that the shared data would not identify you as an individual person:
We will not disclose any de-identified or aggregated data in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
All your Personal Data will be removed or obfuscated prior to any such sharing. If we do combine de-identified information with your Personal Data, the combined information will be treated as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.
We take measures designed to restrict such third party partner to whom we share the de-identified or aggregated Data from re-identifying or attempting to re-identify you as an individual person.
Opt-out
: To the extent such sharing is deemed as “sale” under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out from such sharing as further described in
Section 8.4
below.

support@reward.me
.
8. California Resident Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the
“Exercising Your Rights” section
below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at
support@reward.me
.
8.1. Access
You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:
The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.
8.2. Deletion
You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
8.3. Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
Email us at:
support@reward.me
Submit a form at this address:
https://reward.me/do-not-sell
You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.
8.4. Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In
The California Consumer Protection Act gives California residents the right to stop the “sale” of their personal information through a mechanism called “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” button or hyperlink. In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the CCPA.
While there are many positive impacts of this requirement, California’s definition of “sale” also captures the transfer of data between corporate affiliates (that is, companies that share common ownership) and other transfers that ordinarily may not be thought of as a “sale” in the traditional sense of the word. As described above, we create aggregated or de-identified information based on your Personal Data and then share such aggregated or de-identified data with our partners (including Measurable AI as described in
Section 4.4
above), for which we receive monetary or other valuable consideration, which in turn enables us to provide you with Rewards Point rewards, offers, and other benefits that are a core mission of our Services. We’re committed to implement technical safeguards and business process designed to ensure that de-identified information based on your Personal Data cannot reasonably identify, relate to, describe, or be linked to you, and to prohibit re-identification of you based on such de-identified data.  However, due to the many ambiguities and uncertainties regarding California’s definition of “sale” and de-identification requirements, we’re not sure whether such sharing of aggregated or de-identified data with our partners may still be deemed as “sale” under the CCPA.
To the extent such sharing is deemed as “sale” under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out from these sales as further described below.
We sell your Personal Data to the following categories of third parties:
Our business partners, such as Measurable AI described above.
Over the past 12 months, we have sold the following categories of your Personal Data (after being de-identified in accordance with our standard process) to categories of third parties listed above:
Commercial Data
Consumer Demographic Data
You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data. You can opt-out using the following methods:
You can complete the online form found here:
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
Email us at
support@reward.me
Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale of your Personal Data for at least 12 months.
To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
8.5. We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.  Please note that to the extent you opt-out we may be unable to offer you some of our Services which require such sharing. If you have further questions, you can contact us at
support@reward.me
.
8.6. California Resident Rights Regarding Direct Marketing
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at
support@reward.me

9. Nevada Resident Rights

4.1. Categories of Third Parties with Whom We Share

Depending on state laws that may be applicable to you, some of these disclosures may constitute a “sale” of your Personal Data. For more information, please refer to the state-specific sections below.
Service Providers.
These parties help us provide the Services or perform business functions on our behalf. They include:
Hosting, technology and communication providers.
Security and fraud prevention consultants.
Support and customer service vendors.

Section 5 (Cookies)
below for more information.

Third parties you authorize or authenticate through the services, such as your email service provider, or the issuer of your credit card.
Third party merchants you access through the services
4.2. Legal Obligations
We may share any Personal Data that we collect with third parties in conjunction with any of the activities set forth under “Meeting Legal Requirements and Enforcing Legal Terms” in the
“Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data” section
above.
4.3. Business Transfers
All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.
4.4. Data that is Not Personal Data
As described in
Section 3.3 (Creating De-identified or Aggregated Data)
above, we may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data (e.g. Commercial Data and Consumer Demographic Data) we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our and their lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, to research and develop new products and services, generate analytics or reports, facilitate researches or studies, and gain consumer insights or other business intelligence, to optimize marketing efficiency, or for other legitimate business purposes.
4.4.1. Sharing with Measurable AI:
Specifically, we share aggregated or de-identified data based on your Personal Data with
Measurable AI
, an enterprise-facing database and platform that provides alternative data (that doesn’t include any Personal Data) to enable its subscribers to use, review, analyze such data to gain consumer insights, industry developments, market trends, marketing optimization, and other business intelligence. For example, we (through MailTime) scan and identify purchase receipts from Commercial Messages collected from your email account linked to the Services, aggregate such de-identified information with other de-identified information from our other users of the Services to create de-identified and/or aggregated data, which will become part of the database or data feeds we provide to Measurable AI.
We adopt the following measures designed to ensure that the shared data would not identify you as an individual person:
We will not disclose any de-identified or aggregated data in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
All your Personal Data will be removed or obfuscated prior to any such sharing. If we do combine de-identified information with your Personal Data, the combined information will be treated as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.
We take measures designed to restrict such third party partner to whom we share the de-identified or aggregated Data from re-identifying or attempting to re-identify you as an individual person.
Opt-out
: To the extent such sharing is deemed as “sale” under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out from such sharing as further described in
Section 8.4
below.

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
7. Personal Data of Children
As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under 16  years of age; if you are a child under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at
support@reward.me
.
8. California Resident Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the
“Exercising Your Rights” section
below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at
support@reward.me
.
8.1. Access
You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:
The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.
8.2. Deletion
You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
8.3. Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
Email us at:
support@reward.me
Submit a form at this address:
https://reward.me/do-not-sell
You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.
8.4. Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In
The California Consumer Protection Act gives California residents the right to stop the “sale” of their personal information through a mechanism called “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” button or hyperlink. In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the CCPA.
While there are many positive impacts of this requirement, California’s definition of “sale” also captures the transfer of data between corporate affiliates (that is, companies that share common ownership) and other transfers that ordinarily may not be thought of as a “sale” in the traditional sense of the word. As described above, we create aggregated or de-identified information based on your Personal Data and then share such aggregated or de-identified data with our partners (including Measurable AI as described in
Section 4.4
above), for which we receive monetary or other valuable consideration, which in turn enables us to provide you with Rewards Point rewards, offers, and other benefits that are a core mission of our Services. We’re committed to implement technical safeguards and business process designed to ensure that de-identified information based on your Personal Data cannot reasonably identify, relate to, describe, or be linked to you, and to prohibit re-identification of you based on such de-identified data.  However, due to the many ambiguities and uncertainties regarding California’s definition of “sale” and de-identification requirements, we’re not sure whether such sharing of aggregated or de-identified data with our partners may still be deemed as “sale” under the CCPA.
To the extent such sharing is deemed as “sale” under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out from these sales as further described below.
We sell your Personal Data to the following categories of third parties:
Our business partners, such as Measurable AI described above.
Over the past 12 months, we have sold the following categories of your Personal Data (after being de-identified in accordance with our standard process) to categories of third parties listed above:
Commercial Data
Consumer Demographic Data
You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data. You can opt-out using the following methods:
You can complete the online form found here:
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
Email us at
support@reward.me
Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale of your Personal Data for at least 12 months.
To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
8.5. We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.  Please note that to the extent you opt-out we may be unable to offer you some of our Services which require such sharing. If you have further questions, you can contact us at
support@reward.me
.
8.6. California Resident Rights Regarding Direct Marketing
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at
support@reward.me
.
9. Nevada Resident Rights
If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data. You can exercise this right by contacting us at
support@reward.me
with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your account. Please note that we do not currently sell your Personal Data as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.
10. International Users

Planto's Privacy Policy
Introduction
Planto Limited (hereinafter also referred to as 'Planto', 'we', 'us' or 'our') is a software as a service platform that offers goal setting, account aggregation, automated expense tracking and access to 3 rd party financial products via our mobile application (hereinafter also referred to as 'the App') as well as our website.
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Planto collects, uses, maintains and discloses Personal Data collected from you as the users (hereinafter also referred to as 'users', 'you' or 'your') of our App and website. We will also explain the measures being, and to be, taken to ensure that your Personal Data stays secure and confidential in compliance with the applicable data protection laws. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Planto.
By accessing or using our App or website, you signify your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Definitions
'Personal Data' refers to the 'Personal Financial Data' and the 'Personal Identification Data'. 'Personal Financial Data' and 'Personal Identification Data' are respectively defined in paragraph 4 below.
'Non-Personal Data' is any data that is not reasonably practicable to directly or indirectly identify you, including but not limited to aggregated data, application usage, in-app browsing activity, and application activity including user interface elements, etc.
'Third-party partners' are any individual or organization that cooperate with us for the purpose of facilitating or improving our services or third-party partners' services provided to you.
Our Privacy Principles
Planto builds its business on trust between our users and us. Therefore, security and safety of our users' Personal Data is our top priority. To preserve the confidentiality of all Personal Data you provide to us, we maintain the following privacy principles:
We will only collect Personal Data that we have identified in this Privacy Policy which we will use to deliver our services to you, and to facilitate third party services at your consent , operate our business, and help make the App useful, more intelligent, and work better for you.
We maintain strict security systems designed to prevent unauthorised access to your Personal Data by anyone, including our employees, agents and contractors.
Any members of the Planto, including our employees, agents and contractors, who are permitted access to any Personal Data may only do so for a specific and limited purpose and limited time and during such access, are specifically required to strictly observe our confidentiality obligations.
Other than as specified in paragraph 4.5 of this Privacy Policy, we generally do not disclose, sell, trade, or rent your personal data to any third parties.
By maintaining our commitment to these principles, we will ensure that we respect the inherent trust that you have placed in us.
Data Collection and Purpose
We may collect and process information from you, including Personal Data, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, when you register for, install, download, access or use the App, or when you contact us in relation to the App. However, we will only use your Personal Data as set out below and always in accordance with the applicable laws.
When you register for and use the Planto App or website, we collect your email address and device ID which we use to:
provide you with our services via the Planto App or website;
identify you and the accounts you have registered with us;
communicate with you;
customise the Planto App or website based on your preference; and
notify you of any changes to the Planto App or to our services that may affect you.
We may leverage your mobile device's built-in biometric authentication tools to provide you with added security to ensure there will be no unauthorized access to the App. This includes facial recognition information and your fingerprint.
When you use the App or our website to access or connect to your online financial accounts (including but not limited to, online banking accounts, insurance accounts, electronic payment accounts, eStatements, third party mobile and online payment accounts), we may collect and process details such as account name, currency of the account, outstanding balance, credit limit, your transaction details and history, payment dates and names and addresses of goods and services providers that appear in your account (collectively known as 'Personal Financial Data'), for the purposes of displaying the account information and transaction feed to you, providing you with services on the App and from time to time, conduct research & development for technological enhancement. For the avoidance of doubt, Personal Financial Data for this purpose does not include information that is aggregated with similar data from other users to produce Aggregated Data as defined in paragraph 5 below, or is otherwise no longer identifiable to any specific App user.

Your Personal Identification Data will only be used at your request or consent.
We may collect or store any usernames, passwords, other authentication details, bank account numbers or credit card numbers for your online accounts. Online log-in credentials always remain encrypted on your device or securely stored on our server
We may record certain Non-Personal Data, such as application usage, in-app browsing activity, and application activity including user interface elements. Along with cookies, we may also use third-party tracking technologies, such as Amplitude, OneSignal and Google Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity on the App. We may grant access to such Non-Personal Data and tracking activity to certain trusted third-party services providers that we work with, but only to perform services on our behalf with restricted access to Personal Data on a need-to-know basis only, and always in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
When you make any purchases on Planto, your credit card information and other payment details will not be collected by us, but only by third party payment processors.
Aggregated Data
For the purpose of producing research and statistical collective data amongst the App users and provide you with services on the App, we may aggregate your Personal Financial Data together with similar data from other App users ('Aggregated Data'). Aggregated Data will be produced in such a manner that the underlying data will no longer be identifiable to any specific user. We may share Aggregate Data amongst users as part of the services provided, and also with our third party partners to help us make improvements and/or enhancements to our services and for marketing, research and academic purposes. Rest assured that Aggregate Data cannot be linked to an individual or user in any way.
Whilst we take all reasonable steps to anonymise the Aggregate Data, please be informed that these measures are provided on a best-effort basis. In the event that you believe that any of your Personal Data is or has been inadvertently captured in the App or in any report generated or services provided by us, whether within or outside the App, it is your responsibility to immediately notify us at hello@planto.hk so that we are able to promptly rectify the situation.
Sharing and Disclosure
We may share users' Personal Data, Non-Personal Data or Aggregated Data to third parties in the following situations:
Our business partners: We cooperate with our business partners to deliver their services to you. With your consent through our business partner, we may provide some of your Personal Data, Non-Personal Data or Aggregated Data to our business partners, on a need-to-know basis. For instance, we may share your Personal Financial Data to our business partners for them to display or render their services to you. Further, if you have applied for certain financial services on the App, we may need to share your Personal Data to our business partners for processing your application. All information and data which we share to our business partners will also be subject to their own privacy policies, and you are recommended to review their privacy policies prior to making an application for their services through our App and/or website.
Security, legal and regulatory requirements: We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to government authorities that have jurisdiction over our company or to our professional advisors such as auditors, lawyers, where it is appropriate or necessary to (i) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (ii) take precautions against liability, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the services we provide and any facilities or equipment used to make those services available, (v) comply with any law or regulatory requirement, including pursuant to a court order or other legal process, or (vi) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others
Data Retention
Online log-in credentials always remain encrypted on your device or securely stored on our server.
We shall take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected is not kept longer than is necessary for fulfilment of the purpose for which it is or is to be used. In some situations, upon we collecting the Personal Data, Non-Personal Data and/or Aggregate Data from you, and transferring such data to our business partners to facilitate our business partners to supply their services to you, we may immediately delete the data that has been passed to our business partners, and we may not store any such data on the App and our website.
Unless otherwise specified in paragraph 7 .1 of this Privacy Policy, Non-Personal Data including Aggregate Data will continue to be stored and retained on our servers indefinitely. We reserve the right to retain and use Aggregate Data derived from the use of the App.

You have the right to request access to and correction of your Personal Data held by Planto. We will respond to your request for data access or correction as soon as practicable upon receiving your request. A reasonable administrative fee may be charged for responding to a data access request to reflect the cost of responding to the request.
Data Security
Your responsibility:
The App and website requires a user ID and password and/or biometric verification to log in. You should safeguard your user ID and password and keep them secret and confidential. We will never ask you for your password given that you should be the only person who knows it. We strongly recommend that you use strong passwords between 6-16 characters long that are difficult for others to guess. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. In public areas, you should exercise caution and not leave your mobile device unattended or susceptible to theft whilst logged into your account.
If you suspect that your credentials have been stolen or been made known to others, it is your responsibility to change your password immediately and contact us promptly at hello@planto.hk. We shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any unauthorised access to your account due to any failure to comply with these precautions or through any violation of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use.
You should only download the App and its updates from official Play Store and App Store and not from any unofficial sources.
Our commitment to safeguarding your Personal Data:
To maintain the safety and security of your Personal Data, and to protect the App accounts and systems from unauthorized access, we use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others. Our system will always prompt you to enter your credentials or biometric authentication for your privacy and security. The Personal Data that is collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy is transmitted securely to our servers. Access to our systems requires multiple levels of authentication. Our databases are protected from general employee access.
However, the aforementioned security efforts do not preclude us from the possibility of fraud, cyber-attacks, such as hacking, spyware and viruses, and we do not warrant that our servers or network will be immune from such attacks. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from such risks.

We shall notify you of such changes by any reasonable means, including posting the revised version of the Terms of Use on the App or Planto website. It is your responsibility to frequently check on the changes, your continued use of the App following the changes to the Terms of Use will constitute your acceptance of those changes.

How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.
