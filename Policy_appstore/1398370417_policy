Supplemental Privacy Policy for California Residents
Welcome to Luminary.
This Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Luminary Media, LLC (“Luminary,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and use about you when you access or use the Luminary applications, websites, software and services, including premium features (collectively, the “Service”). Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our
Terms of Service.
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
1. The Information We Collect
We obtain information about you when you use or otherwise access the Service. Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the Service to you. If you do not provide us with such information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain parts of our Service.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, you may provide us with information through your:
Use of the Service;
Requests or questions you submit to us via online forms, email, or otherwise;
Account registration and administration of your account;
Uploading or posting of User Content;
Requests for customer support and/or technical assistance;
Purchases, e.g. for our Premium Service;
Registration for any contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions or events we may sponsor;
Application for a job or internship;
Participation in surveys we may make available; or
Provision of other information to us within or outside of the Service.
The types of data we collect directly from you include:
Registration information. If you register for an account on the Service, we collect certain information such as your name, email address, and password. If you register for our Premium Service, we may also collect your payment information such as your credit card number, billing address, and phone number.
Profile information. You may provide additional information about yourself to create a user profile (“Profile”), including but not limited to a user name, photo, listening preferences, and interests. Your Profile may be publicly available to other users, so please only include information you would like to be publicly available. Please do not add sensitive information to your Profile.
Listening and search history. You may provide additional information about yourself by searching through offerings on the Service and selecting which podcasts to listen to. You may also give us permission to import information from other apps about podcasts to which you regularly listen or subscribe.
User Content. The Service may allow you to post content and interact with other Luminary listeners. We collect the User Content you upload or otherwise transmit to the Service.
Information We Collect From Third Parties
We may collect information about you or others through our affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to register for an account through a social networking account. If you access the Service through a social media account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your social media profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or “likes.” Social networking sites have their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.
We may also collect information about you from non-affiliated third parties for fraud or safety protection purposes, or for marketing purposes. We likewise may combine information that we collect from you through the Service with information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide.
Information We Collect Automatically
Device/Usage Information: We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect and store information about your use of the Service. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information including, but not limited to: (1) browser type; (2) ISP; (3) operating system; (4) access time; (5) IP address; (6) unique device identifiers (“Device IDs”) (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); (7) the type of device that you use; (8) the MAC address of your device; and (9) information regarding the location (which may include the precise location) of your mobile device or of certain routers through which your device has connected to the Internet. The above information may be linked or associated with a user account, cookie identifier or a Device ID. To learn more about those technologies, go to sub-sections (d) and (e), immediately below.
Cookies, Pixels, and Log Data.
Cookies and pixels are files that websites and online services create and access on your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. If you communicate with us through your browser, we or other companies may use cookies and similar technologies to log information such as your device type, screen size, operating system type, browser type, network connection type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Service and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. They also may log information (“Log Data”) about your interaction with our Service, such as which pages you visit. To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “Web beacons,” which are files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies.
We may deploy and permit other companies (such as ad networks and other third party platforms) to deploy cookies and pixels in order to customize content, deploy advertising and perform analytics about how users engage with our Services. We may use cookies for other functional and operational purposes as well, such as to render content, or for security and anti-fraud purposes. Sometimes, cookie-based advertising employs data collected across websites and over time, or other information about your browser, browsing history or other activity. This “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising is usually more relevant to you, but it also generally involves the collection and use of more information about you and your browsing history. There are easy ways to opt out of most or all interest-based or personalized advertising: we describe how to do that in Section 4 titled
“Your Ad Choices and Interest Based Advertising.”
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We may also sometimes use mobile SDKs to collect or transmit information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), to third parties. A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon (see “Cookies, Pixels and Log Data” above). The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology to deliver certain content and advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device, or simply to analyze how people use our Service. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 titled
“Your Ad Choices and Interest-Based Advertising.”
We may deploy and permit other companies (such as ad networks and other third party platforms) to deploy SDKs in our app in order to customize content, deploy advertising and perform analytics about how users engage with our Service. We may use SDKs for other functional and operational purposes as well, such as to render content, or for security and anti-fraud purposes. Sometimes, SDK-based advertising employs data collected across multiple mobile apps over time, or other information about your browser, browsing history, location or other activity. This “cross-app” advertising is usually more relevant to you, but it also generally involves the collection and use of more information about you and your mobile app history. There are easy ways to opt out of most or all of cross-app advertising: we describe how to do that in Section 4 titled
“Your Ad Choices and Interest-Based Advertising.”
2. How We Use Information Collected
We may use the information we collect, alone or in combination, for various business and commercial purposes, including, but not limited to providing the Service as well as the following:
To fulfill the purposes for which you provided it (such as providing you with the podcast content you requested);
To provide you with content recommendations;
To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to retarget content, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using our Services;
For customer support and to respond to your inquiries;
For internal record-keeping purposes;
To tailor content or advertising to you, such as when we analyze your search and listening history to recommend content that may be of interest to you;
To communicate with you, including to send you updates, newsletters and other information that may be of interest to you;
To send push notifications to your wireless device or computer to provide updates and other relevant messages (you can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” function in your mobile app);
To improve the Service and to research and develop innovative features and new services;
To create or maintain aggregated, anonymized or de-identified information, which we may use and disclose without restriction;
To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding unlawful or harmful activities, including potential threats to physical safety, potential fraud, and violations of our Terms of Service;
To safeguard our and others’ rights or property;
To process any job applications you submit; and
To otherwise administer and troubleshoot the Service.
We may combine any of the information that we collect from you with other information, including information that we obtain from third parties, or with information derived from any other products or services we provide. For example, we may combine personal information you provide us, such as an email address, with information automatically collected about your device. We may use this combined information to, among other things, provide you with personalized recommendations.
Cross-Device Targeting.
Sometimes, we (or our service providers) may use the information we collect—for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers—to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings.
3. How We Share Your Information
We may share your information with various third parties, including service providers and business partners, in the following ways or for the following reasons:
With our affiliates for business purposes.
With service providers that help us operate our business by assisting us with content distribution, hosting, data analytics and enhancement, operations and tech support, customer support, marketing, security and other back-end support.
To deliver or customize content to you. For instance, when we deliver or retrieve content, a third party content platform may receive unique information such as your IP address or browser or device identifiers and related information;
To tailor advertising to you when you use the Service or interact with other services, apps or content, or to deliver information or offers to you that we believe may be of interest. This may involve sharing various identifiers and data about your activities on our Service with third party platforms (such as advertising or data platforms);
When we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Luminary, our affiliates, employees, agents, licensors or users, or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.
When we believe in good faith that doing so may prevent harm to any person.
To transfer the information we hold in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (such as in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation) or take steps (such as due diligence) in anticipation of such a transaction.
To create, maintain or share aggregated or de-identified data without restriction.
We may share your User Content or Profile with other users. We may provide you with the ability to control certain of this sharing through settings available in the Service. If we do so, we cannot control how others will use the information you make available to others.
In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.
In addition, to help us better understand your use of the Service, we may use third-party analytics on our Service. These third parties use the sorts of technologies described in the “Information We Collect Automatically” section above. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.
4. Your Ad Choices and Interest-Based Advertising
Interest-Based or “Personalized” Advertising.
We and our third-party vendors may use Device IDs and other automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on our website), along with other collected information, to deliver content or tailor ads when you are on our Service or on other devices, apps or websites. These ads may be based, for instance, on the types of websites that you visit over time, the types of apps you have on your device, or de-identified information about you and your likely interests, based on your activities off of our Service. We may also use the type of “cross-device targeting” we describe in
Section 2
to help identify our users and serve advertising. Others—such as content creators—may use similar technologies and methods to serve ads on our Service. This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.
Thus, for instance, if you frequently listen to sports podcasts, we might tailor ads to you about new sports podcasts either on our Service or on other services, websites and apps. We also might work with content creators to help them serve more relevant ads or offer more relevant content.
Partners that we or others work with to do the above may track your activities over time (including across different apps or websites) by collecting information through automated means, and they may use this information, and other information they receive from us or other sources, to deliver advertisements to you.
Opting Out of Interest-Based and Cross-App Advertising.
You can learn more about interest-based advertising on the web, or opt out of receiving those ads, by visiting (i) the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out
or (ii)
the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
. As to cross-app advertising, each operating system (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your Device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our Service, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
Do Not Track
We do not respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions.
Listening History and Advertising Opt-Out.
We may use your listening history to provide more tailored advertisements to you, for example, an advertisement recommending a new podcast that may interest you. If you want to opt out of such use of that information, please email with your request to
privacy@luminarypodcasts.com
with the subject line “Listening History and Advertising Opt Out”.
5. How Long We Keep Information
We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above and in compliance with applicable law. To dispose of any personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.
6. How We Protect Your Information
We take various technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or across devices, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
7. Your Choices
a. GDPR Information: For residents of the European Union and EEA Countries, and countries that grant similar privacy rights
Our Legal Bases for Use of Your Information
Under applicable law (for instance, the GDPR, and other laws that adhere to this distinction), Luminary is considered the “data controller” of the personal data we handle under this Privacy Policy. In other words, Luminary is responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this data, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Policy.
European privacy laws require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing of your information. To the extent those laws (or other similar laws) apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you.
With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.
Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Service, preventing fraud, for our billing and records purposes, and managing legal issues.
Legal Compliance: We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
Your Rights and Choices Under the GDPR and Similar National Privacy Laws
If you are a European resident, or a resident of a country that grants similar privacy rights, you may have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:
Profile, Notification Preferences & Settings: You may update or correct the information in your Profile and notification preferences at any time by logging in to your account and going to your settings page.
Marketing Communications: You can decline promotional communications at the point information is requested or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you. You can also contact us as described in the
“How to Contact Us”
section below.
Cookies & Analytics: You can opt out of certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in Section 4 titled
"Your Ad Choices and Interest-Based Advertising."
Additional Legal Rights Under European and Other National Privacy Laws

We may in our sole discretion reject requests if we are not required by law to respond, or if we deem such request to be unreasonable or impractical, such as if it would require disproportionate technological effort or expose us to operational risks. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the
“How to Contact Us”
section below. In addition to those rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.

It applies to personal information we collect on or through the Service and through other means (such as information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone). It does not apply to personal information we collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as employees and job applicants.

Rights
If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights.  California law may permit you to request that we:
Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at
privacy@luminarypodcasts.com
or visit
here
. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.  To do so, you will need to provide certain account information for verification. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf.  You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Luminary does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.
