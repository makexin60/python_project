Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Wildlife Studios at
privacy@wildlifestudios.com
.
THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.
Information Required to Play our Games
. We may collect personal information when you first play one of our games, such as the nickname you choose to display to other players. Some of our games may also ask you your age.
Content Creator program

To apply to be a partner, we collect your full name, channel name on YouTube and/or Twitch, primary and secondary channel links, email address, subscriber/follower count, player ID, age, and optional country/region information and Discord ID. Please review our
Content Partner Privacy Policy

For example, some games include voice chat features, while other games may allow you to upload photos from your device to modify and share through our games.

Although our apps are designed for a general audience, we take additional precautions in our games if we determine that they are targeted to children, such as including a neutral age-gate and disabling some features for kids.
Protecting children’s privacy online is very important to us. Although our Services are designed for a general audience, we take additional steps to limit access to Services that appeal to children based on the player’s age, such as by disabling social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts. We also limit personal information collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has uploaded personal information to our site without your consent, or wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “
Contact Us
” below. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, if applicable.
Third-Party Websites/Applications. The Services may contain links to other websites/applications and other websites/applications may reference or link to our Services. These third-party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our players to read the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact.

Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.

Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.

In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively, “personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can opt out of said sharing by using our

Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.
If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.

These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time.

Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Wildlife Studios at
privacy@wildlifestudios.com

THE BOTTOM LINE:
·       We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
·       Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy.
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.

Please review our
Content Partner Privacy Policy

Interactive Features
.

Some games may request access to your microphone and/or photo library to enable certain optional social features. For example, some games include voice chat features, while other games may allow you to upload photos from your device to modify and share through our games.
Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered “public,” unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other players.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Additionally, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which you can learn more about at
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as a Do Not Sell request where required under applicable law, and we will also interpret it as a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising for residents of the European Economic Area, the UK, China and Brazil.

EU Standard Contractual Clauses

Wildlife Studios does not “sell” personal information, nor do we have actual knowledge of any “sale” of personal information of minors under 16 years of age, as the term “sell” is commonly understood. That said, we may share information with third-party advertising partners for the purpose of promoting our Services as described above. You may limit such sharing by following the instructions found above in the section titled
Your Privacy Choices and Rights
> Your Privacy Choices > Cookies and Personalized Advertising, or by contacting us as set forth in “

” below.
Subject to applicable law, if you are a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, or Colorado, you may have the following rights:
To Know and Access
: to obtain a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to Personal Information relating to you, and not to any other player.)
Deletion
: to request that we delete your Personal Information. This right may be limited to the extent that we are permitted or required by applicable law to retain certain information. (Note that if you request deletion of your Personal Information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you decide to use or access the Services again, we may consider this a new account, and may collect Personal Information associated with that account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
Opt-Out of “Sale” and Certain Sharing Practices
: you have the right to opt-out of certain information sharing practices with third parties who do not act as our service providers. In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively, “personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can opt out of said sharing by using our
webform
, or by contacting us as
set forth in “Contact Us” below
.
Correction

We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you exercise any of the rights listed above.
Verification and Appeal Process
: We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.
If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.

: Depending on where you live, you may have the right to use an authorized agent on their behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a player to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the player, and have sufficient access to that player’s laptop, desktop, or mobile device to exercise that player’s right digitally. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of one of our players, then you can make a request on the player’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below in the “
Contact Us
” section: Such requests must include the following information: (1) a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s full name, address, telephone number and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us, that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority; and (2) a certificate of good standing with your state of organization.  Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us.  The email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority with the consumer.

We may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide Personal Information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your Personal Information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us as described in “

,
our
) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
The Company is a “data controller” within the meaning of the GDPR. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you. This Applicant Privacy and Data Protection Notice (the Notice) is intended to ensure that you are aware of what personal data we hold in relation to you and how we use that data, in accordance with the GDPR.
For the purposes of this Notice:
GDPR
means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) and any national implementing laws, as amended or updated from time to time;
Group Company
means a company which is a Subsidiary or Holding Company of the Company or any Subsidiary of such Holding Company from time to time (and for this purpose
Subsidiary
and
Holding Company
have the meanings given to them respectively in sections 7 and 8 of the Companies Act 2014).
Please read the following carefully to understand how and why we are using such information and what your rights are under the applicable data protection legislation.
This Notice applies to you because either (i) we have identified you as a potential candidate for future recruitment; and/or (ii) you have applied to work with us (whether as an employee, agency worker, consultant, individual contractor or director); and/or (iii) you have been referred to us for potential employment; and/or (iv) you have reached us or was reached by us through an event sponsored or organized by us. This Notice also applies to third parties whose information you provide to us in connection with our relationship with you (for example, in respect of references). Please ensure that you provide a copy of this Notice to any third parties whose personal data you provide to us.
This Notice does not form part of any offer of employment or contract of employment and does not confer any contractual right on you, or place any contractual obligation on us.
This Notice applies to all personal data collected, maintained, transmitted, stored, retained, or otherwise used (i.e. processed) by us regardless of the media on which that personal data is stored. We may update this Notice at any time and will notify you, where appropriate, in writing of any material changes.
The Company is committed to complying with the GDPR. Any personal information that we hold about you must be:
Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;
Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;
Relevant to the purposes that we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;
Accurate and kept up to date;
Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; and
Kept securely.
‘Personal Data’
is defined as any information relating to a living individual from whom that individual can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We will collect, hold and use the following categories of Personal Data about you as set out in Appendix 1 of this Notice.
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information for the following purposes:
In order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract;
To comply with a legal obligation;
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. In this instance a legitimate interest assessment (LIA) will have been conducted to (i) identify a legitimate interest; (ii) show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and (iii) balance it against your interests, rights and freedoms. You may request a copy of this LIA by contacting privacy@wildlifestudios.com.
In particular, we will hold, process and may disclose personal data provided by you for the following purposes:
Future recruitment to identify potential suitable candidates for particular roles:
i) Having conducted a LIA, the processing of your data is necessary for our legitimate business interest in identifying potential suitable candidates who may be interested in roles which may arise in the future.
ii) Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.
iii) Where we rely on our “legitimate interest” as a reason for processing personal data, we have considered whether those interests are overridden by employees’ rights and freedoms and have concluded that they are not. You have a right to request information on the balancing test we use.
Recruitment/appointment including assessing your job application:
i) This processing of your data is necessary to process job applications submitted by, or on your behalf, and to assist in our determination as to whether to enter into a contract of employment (or engagement) with you.
Collecting any demographic information you choose to provide when you apply for a position through our website.
i) This processing is necessary for our talent acquisition team to learn how best to communicate with you and understand the demographic share of the applicants to our roles.
ii)  We rely on your explicit consent to collect this information. You have the right to revoke this consent at any time – please refer to Your Data Rights below for more information.
iii) Providing this information is entirely voluntary and you can select “I don’t wish to answer” if you would prefer not to respond to each question. This will not affect your hiring process, and any such information provided will not be considered for hiring decision. This information is not shared beyond the talent acquisition team.
Managing health and safety at work and incident reporting, and for exercising our right to defend, respond or conduct legal proceedings:
i) This processing of your data is necessary in order for us to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations.
Sending email marketing to you where you have signed up to our newsletter.
i) This processing is necessary for our legitimate interests in marketing and promoting our business
[JN1]
, and the sending of such emails is based on your prior consent to receive such communications.
ii) Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Information about criminal convictions also warrants a higher level of protection. We will only process data relating to your criminal convictions or involvement in criminal proceedings when permitted by law, or where provided voluntarily by you.
In principle, we do not rely on your consent for data use.
We may, however, from time to time, (i) ask for your consent to use your personal data for a specific purpose; and/or (ii) process your personal data (including “special data”) in order to protect your vital interests or the interests of another. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the data that we would like and the reason we need it. We will also inform you about the fact that you can revoke your consent at any time and how you should do that. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal data and, subject to our data retention policy, we will dispose of your personal data securely.
If you do not provide us with your personal data we may not be able to process your job application or assess your suitability for a particular role, comply with our legal obligations or manage our business. We will tell you when we ask for information which is a statutory or contractual requirement or needed to comply with our legal obligations.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We securely store your personal data, with controlled access to it. Access to personal data (including special data) in both electronic and paper form is restricted to the Greenhouse three site administrators (two based in√ä Brazil and one in the United States), and the Recruiting Lead in Ireland, all of which have a legitimate and justifiable reason to view such data.
Third parties to whom we have provided your personal data will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
We may disclose your personal data to a Group Company including, without limitation, for the following reasons: in order to run global processes; carry out group wide reporting; or take decisions about hiring or promotion.
It may be necessary from time to time for us to disclose personal data to third parties or agents, including without limitation to the following:
Third parties to assist in the administration, processing and management of certain activities pertaining to prospective employees, for example Zoom (to set up online job interviews), Greenhouse (our recruitment platform), Tableau (our business intelligence platform), HackerRank (used for assessment tests of prospective candidates), and DocuSign (for electronic signatures of job offers);
Individuals or companies employed by the Company to carry out specific services, functions or consultancy work including external reference agencies and other financial institutions;
Relatives or legal representatives of prospective employees;
Regulatory bodies to whom we are obliged or required to disclose information including Workplace Relations Commission, Courts and Court-appointed persons;
Legal and medical practitioners;
Potential purchasers or bidders;
Relevant Government departments and agencies; and
Other support service providers necessary to assist the Company with the above.
We will inform you, where appropriate, in advance if we intend to further process or disclose your personal data for a purpose other than the purposes set out above. We take all reasonable steps, as required by law, to ensure the safety, privacy and integrity of such data and information and, where appropriate, enter into contracts with such third parties to protect the privacy and integrity of such data and any information supplied.
The personal data that we collect in relation to you may be transferred to, and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for the purposes described above. Due to the global nature of our business, your personal data may be disclosed to Group Companies outside the EEA, including, in particular, Brazil and United States of America. It may also be processed by personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers who act on our behalf. We will ensure suitable safeguards are in place to protect the privacy and integrity of your personal data in such circumstances including standard contractual clauses under Article 46.2 or adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR. You can obtain information and a copy of documentation pertaining to these safeguards from the Country Manager where applicable.
Data will be stored for as long as required to satisfy the purpose for which the data was collected and used, unless a longer period is necessary for our legal, accounting or reporting obligations or for the exercise or defence of legal claims. In circumstances where we have collected your personal data for future potential roles, we generally retain your data for a period of 1 year. After this period, the data is anonymized.
The Company may retain your name and email address on a cool off list after the initial retention period, for 1 more year, in situations where your recruiting process ended because either you have reached the interview or testing phase, but has not been hired, or the position you have applied to is not being offered anymore; in both cases the Company might find your profile of interest for future opportunities and may retain your data in a cool off list.
The Company may also retain your name and email address in a suppression list, after the 1 year period, in order not to contact you again for a period of 1 more year. The suppression list does not prevent you from applying again to the recruiting process, as it is just used to avoid further recruiting approach from the Company afterwards. Your data will be anonymized at the end of this period.
You have several rights in relation to your personal data under applicable privacy and data protection law, which may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions such as when the processing of your data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for the exercise or defence of legal claims.
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the following rights:
Right to Withdraw Consent
:
If we are processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent, you are entitled to withdraw your consent at any time (see Contact Us below). However, the withdrawal of your consent will not invalidate any processing we carried out prior to your withdrawal and based on your consent.
