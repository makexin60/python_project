Medical Disclaimer concerning the Apps
AppSurgeOn Apps, their contents, updates, add-ons and gadgets they may work with (the “Apps”) have been created, released and provided by a team of physicians, residents and medical students (the “UpSurgeOn Team” –
http://www.upsurgeon.com/about-us
).
User acknowledges that Apps are merely simulators intended only for informational and educational purposes and supplementary training for physicians and medical professionals in the neurosurgery field. UpSurgeOn and its affiliates do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of contents of the Apps as well as that they are up to date, and assume no legal liability in connection therewith.
The information and/or training methods made available or obtained through the Apps cannot replace the experience and skills provided by a conventional medical and neurosurgery training, nor to university and/or specialized education. User agrees to use the information and/or training methods contained in the Apps solely for his/her private educational purposes and further agrees not to rely on such information in any way. Reliance on such information is solely at User’s own risk.
The Apps shall never be used to give diagnosis, treatments, or to set up surgeries involving real human beings. UpSurgeon is not responsible for the consequences of any injury or death in case the Apps are used in the above-mentioned situations. Medical practitioners must make their own independent assessments before performing surgical procedures or suggesting a diagnosis or recommending or instituting a course of treatment.
UpSurgeon shall not be responsible for the competency of any physician or person who gets information or trains by means of the Apps, nor for the performances of such person based on the information made available by the Apps.
The Apps are merely simulative and they must not be intended as a real medical training; training by means of the Apps will not suffice to get the necessary proficiency to operate as a neurosurgeon. The assessment of a physician readiness to undertake neurosurgeries is the solely responsibility of the hospital or medical facility where the surgery takes place, in relation to which UpSurgeon or it affiliates do not have any role.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that the rules set out under this Medical Disclaimer shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of Italy.
