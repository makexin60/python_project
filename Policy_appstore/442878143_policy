).‎
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY
CAREFULLY.
By using our Service or otherwise by
choosing to ‎provide us with your Personal Information, you acknowledge and
consent to the processing of your ‎Personal Information in Canada in accordance
with this Policy and as may be further identified when ‎the Personal
Information is collected.  If you are located or residing outside of Canada,
please be ‎aware that our Service is intended for and directed to users in
Canada, and the privacy laws and ‎principles in Canada may differ and not offer
the same level of protection as those in your location or ‎residing
country/region.  Through your continued use of our Service you are transferring
your personal ‎information to Canada and you expressly consent to that
transfer. We will use this consent as the legal ‎basis for such data transfer,
unless otherwise stated in this Policy.   ‎
a)
“
Personal Information
” means information that determines the identity
of an individual. ‎Most of the information we collect is considered Personal
Information, and is also private and sensitive, such as ‎the financial
information you give us. Some information is not Personal Information. We take
the collection and ‎storage of all information, especially Personal Information
very ‎seriously.‎
b)
Legal Basis:
We will process your
Personal Information only with your knowledge and consent, except where
‎exempted, required or permitted by applicable laws. The form of consent may
vary depending on the ‎circumstances and the type of information being
requested.  Your consent may be express with clear ‎options to say “yes” or
“no”, such as by being asked to check a box to indicate your consent, or
‎implied, such as when you provide us with your address through a form or email
seeking information ‎and we use those means to respond to your request.  Your
consent can also be provided by your ‎authorized representative.  Taking into
account the sensitivity of your Personal Information, purposes ‎of collection,
and your reasonable expectations, we will obtain the form of consent that is
appropriate ‎to the Personal Information being processed.  By using our Service
or otherwise by choosing to provide ‎us with your Personal Information, you
acknowledge and consent to the processing of your personal ‎information in
accordance with this Policy and as may be further identified when the personal
‎information is collected.  When we process your Personal Information for a new
purpose, we will ‎document that new purpose and ask for your consent again.‎
If you do not
consent to the processing of your Personal Information in accordance with this
Policy, ‎please do not access or continue to use any aspect of the Service or
otherwise provide any personal ‎information to us.  ‎
You may refuse to
provide consent or may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or

penalty, subject to legal or ‎contractual restrictions and reasonable notice by
