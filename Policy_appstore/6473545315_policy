3. Marketing and Advertising Practices
a) Marketing Activities:
We may engage in marketing activities to provide you with information about our apps, such as tips, offers, and newsletters, which may be sent through emails and push notifications. For these activities, we use data including user identifiers (like Apple ID), mobile identifiers (such as IP addresses and device identifiers), information about your interaction with the app, and inferences about your use of the app. The legal basis for these activities is your explicit consent (Article 6.1.a GDPR) and, for emails related to our products and services, our legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f GDPR) under the soft opt-in rule. You can manage your preferences and consent through the app's privacy settings. Personal data used for marketing is retained for up to ten years from your last interaction with the app or after your subscription expires, after which it is either deleted or anonymized, unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.
b) Targeted Advertising:
For targeted advertising, we use third-party tracking technologies. This includes data such as user identifiers (including Apple ID, IP address, IDFA, AAID), interaction details with the app, advertising data (like ad conversion information and viewed advertisements), and your preferences for ad tracking and receiving personalized ads. The collection of this data is based on your consent. You can control ad tracking in your device settings (for iOS: Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking). The retention period for this data aligns with the policies of the third-party service providers, which are detailed in the "In-app tracking technologies" section.
4. Compliance with Legal Requirements
Legal Compliance:
We may need to process your personal data to comply with legal obligations, like responding to requests from public authorities or proving our compliance with legal requirements. This can involve any kind of information required by law. The legal basis for this processing is either specific legal obligations (Article 6.1.c GDPR) or our legitimate interest in proving compliance (Article 6.1.f GDPR).
Defense:
In situations like corporate transactions (bankruptcy, mergers, acquisitions), or to establish, exercise, or defend our rights and those of our employees, we may process any necessary personal data. This processing is based on our legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f GDPR). The retention period for such data is a maximum of ten years from your last app interaction or post-subscription expiration. Specific legal obligations might require different retention periods, and in such cases, those periods will apply. After the retention period, the data is either deleted or anonymized.
5.  Who We Share Your Data With
At Hancy AI, we take your privacy seriously and only share your personal data with third parties when necessary and under lawful grounds.
