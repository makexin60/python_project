Depending on your use of the Services and how we otherwise interact with you, we may collect or obtain information from and about you in several ways, including (A) directly from you; (B) automatically when you interact with the Digital Services (as defined below); and (C) from third parties.
Personal Information You Provide
Outside collects personal information from you when you choose to share it with us. This may include when you use the Services; register or create an online account with or through the Services; purchase products or services; request information from us; sign up for subscriptions, newsletters, or our email list; use the Sites or Apps; enter into sweepstakes or other promotions administered by us (or on our behalf); fill out a survey administered by us (or on our behalf); request customer support; sync your contacts or otherwise communicate with or contact us.
The personal information we collect may include your biographical information (i.e., name, physical address, email address, telephone or mobile number, date of birth, and gender), registration information (i.e., username), activity and fitness preferences, photo, household size and other economic information, sizing information for apparel-related services, education level, preferences related to particular product lines, and additional information collected in connection with event participation (i.e., emergency contact information, team information, financial information if needed for disbursements, etc.).
You can choose to transfer information about your contacts to Outside by syncing such contact information from certain specified third-party accounts. If you choose to share your contacts, we will access and store your contacts' information as directed by you to identify potential connections also using our Services and help you connect with them.
Personal Information You Share Publicly or With Others When You Use the Services
You may choose to upload or add photos, videos, comments, reviews, or other content when you use our interactive Sites and Apps. You may also participate in online communities, including on our Sites and Apps and on social media. Any information you may disclose in a public manner on our Sites or Apps or in blogs, on message boards, activity feeds, in chat rooms, or other public forums (including third-party websites, applications, or services) is publicly available. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas.
Certain Services may also offer you the ability to message one-on-one or as a small group. Outside may store this information to continue to make it available to communications participants or as reasonably necessary to achieve a legitimate business or commercial purpose, such as providing you with or billing you for the Services, maintaining and operating the Services, and as necessary to protect Outside’s legal interests.
Personal Information You Provide When You Make a Purchase
If you purchase a paid subscription or other product or service from us, we or our third-party payment processors may collect a payment card number and related financial information (such as CVV, expiration date, and billing address) or information about other payment methods. Outside does not collect or retain your full payment card information. Outside may, however, process your billing address, the expiration date on your card, and the last several digits of your card number.
Information from Linked Accounts
You may choose to provide us access to information directly from your device (which may be a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device you use to access our Sites and/or Apps). This may include your location information, your fitness data, and/or your physical movements. It can also include user-generated content you may provide us with, such as videos and photos, or other data you provide us such as physiological data and/or data related to your lifestyle (including activity logged, distance covered, hardware used and/or other similar data related to your activity).

Photographs You Provide
As noted above, you may provide us with photos of yourself. Additionally, if Outside participates as a service provider for an event organizer, we (and our partners) may capture your likeness in photographs or other recordings. We and/or the applicable race organizer will seek your consent if Outside intends to derive your biometric information from photos or other images solely in association with the categorization of such photos in association with our race photography platform, FinisherPix.
Personal Information Automatically Collected
Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites and Apps and electronic or digital communications (the “Digital Services”), we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or other technologies to automatically or passively collect information about your online activity, your location, and your use of the Digital Services.

Role and Data Controller Contact Details
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other related laws distinguish between organizations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).
We act as a controller with respect to personal information collected from you as you engage with our Services. If you have questions with respect to our processing of your information as a controller, you can contact us by email at the email address set forth in the section entitled “How To Contact Us” below.
Lawful Basis for Processing
The GDPR and related laws require a “lawful basis” for processing personal information. Our lawful bases include the following:
Consent: We may collect, use, and disclose your personal information on the basis of the consent that you provide us at the point of information collection or disclosure.
Contractual necessity: We may collect and use certain personal information where it is either necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. This may include personal information used to provide you with the Services and related transaction information.
Compliance with a legal obligation: We are subject to various legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may use, disclose, and retain your personal information if necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation arising under an applicable law to which we are subject.
Legitimate interests: We may collect and use your personal information to the extent necessary to carry out our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that such interests do not outweigh your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on a legitimate interest in managing our relationship with you; conducting and managing our business; providing you with customer support; developing and enhancing the Services; detecting and preventing fraud and other harmful activities; and monitoring and maintaining the security of our information, systems, and networks.
Onward Transfer
Outside is a global business and it, or its service providers, may process, transfer, and store personal information on servers located in a number of countries inside of the EEA (e.g., Germany) and UK or outside of the EEA and UK, including in the United States and Canada. Since we are committed to protecting your personal information, we take steps to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in place when we transfer personal information across international borders. If the GDPR applies and your data is transferred outside the UK or the EEA to the United States or any other country, we will transfer your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards, such as an adequacy decision by the European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Standard Contractual Clauses, as provided from time to time by the European Commission. You can receive additional information about where your personal information is transferred and the appropriate safeguards by contacting us.
Your Data Subject Rights
Your Rights. If you are a data subject under the GDPR or similar jurisdictions, subject to certain conditions, you have the right to:
Access, rectify, or erase any personal information we process about you;
Data portability – that is, asking us to transfer your personal information to any third party of your choice;
Restrict or object to our processing of your personal information; and
Where applicable, withdraw your consent at any time for any processing of your personal information.
Please see
“
Your Legal Rights
”
above for more information on how to exercise these rights.
Complaints
If you have a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response to your request(s) regarding your personal information, you may submit a complaint to the Data Protection Supervisory Authority in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator and welcome you to first direct an inquiry to us. In addition to our contact details set out above, you can also contact our Designated Individual Overseeing Compliance of this Privacy Policy by following the “How To Contact Us” section below.
5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
The Digital Services may include links to or integrations with third-party websites and/or offer you the ability to interact with social plug-ins from social media platforms. We have no control over the personal information that is collected, stored, or used by third-party websites or social media platforms, and we are not responsible for their information handling or privacy practices. Your use of these third-party services is subject to each provider’s privacy policy, so we encourage you to read these policies carefully.
6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information online from children under the age of 16. Please contact us if you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16 and you believe that we may have collected personal information online from your child. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information online through the Services, we will use reasonable efforts to delete such information.
8. INFORMATION RETENTION
We will retain your personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to satisfy our legal or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed under law.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information; the purpose for which we use the personal information; whether we can achieve the purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.
If we de-identify information, we will maintain and use the information in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information except as required or permitted by law.
7. INFORMATION SECURITY
We take reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the personal information we collect from and about our customers and users of the Services. However, no security system is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
9. REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, remove, or otherwise revise portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. The “Effective Date” at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. When we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of this page to reflect the date such changes occurred. If we change the Privacy Policy in a material way, we will provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect. Unless otherwise stated, your continued use of the Services following the posting of a revised version of this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
