(b) How you can share your User Content
(i) Public Posts
Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as public User Content, becomes available to be read, collected and used by the public. When you set your profile to public, or make User Content public, your information becomes publicly available globally, searchable by other users and can be indexed by search engines. If you or Canva remove information that you posted to the Service, copies remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.
You may share your Canva designs to your social media accounts, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr. You should ensure that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of each of these services and any privacy settings that may apply to the designs you choose to share on those accounts.
(ii) Teams
If you are part of a Team, then any information or content that you create in that Team or activity you take within the Team may be shared with other Team members and the Team Owner. If requested by the Team Owner, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the Team to the Team Owner or to another Team member. The Team Owner or any Team Administrator in your Team may also move, delete or edit any folders or items you share with them, or the Team.
You should ensure that any personal information, confidential information, or User Content that you‚Äôd like to keep private is retained in a separate personal account.
(iii) Design Collaboration
If you accept an invite to view, edit, collaborate on or interact with a Canva design then, subject to your
privacy settings
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
, we may share certain information about your interaction with that design with the design owner and other users who have access to that design, including the following:
your name and avatar will be visible to anyone else in the design at the same time as you, whether or not they are logged in to Canva or anonymous and your email will also be visible to anyone logged in to Canva who is part of your Team;
your name, avatar and interactions (e.g. comments, reactions, responses or answers to interactive functionality) will be visible to any other person that also has edit access to that design, and (depending on the settings chosen by the design owner) may also be visible to anyone else viewing the design; and
your name, avatar, email and usage metrics, including time of access and related insights about how you interact with the design, will become available to any other person that has edit access to that design, including the designer owner, whether or not they are within your Team.
While your name and avatar will remain visible to anyone that has access to a design, you can make your email and usage metrics anonymous by turning the 'Share my design usage with collaborators' toggle off in your
privacy settings
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
.
As the owner or editor of an individual design, you can choose to give other people access to your designs using the following link sharing settings:
1. ‚Äú
Only people added can access
‚Äù: Only people who have been added to those designs via their email or Canva account will have access to your design. Anyone who hasn‚Äôt been added to a design will need to request access from you. This is the most private sharing option, and Canva uses this as the default setting for all designs .
2. ‚Äú
Anyone with the link
‚Äù: Anyone on the internet who has the link can access your design (and view or edit if you select this). We do not recommend this option for information you wish to keep confidential. Please note that this setting will, by default (except for Canva for Education subscriptions) also allow non-Canva users to anonymously access your design (and view the full names, avatars, cursors and comments of logged in users).
3. ‚ÄúOnly your team*‚Äù:
Only people on your team that have the link can access, view or edit (as you select) your design. This means if you share the link on an email or Slack communication with numerous people in your Team, any of them can access the design without further permission. *Subject to being made available for your team.
Canva collects your links and they may be shared with service providers where required to provide the Services. Once you share a link, it may be on-shared by your recipients.
Summary: Our designs are private by default. When sharing and interacting with designs, make sure the privacy settings are appropriate. For designs with personal or confidential information, we don‚Äôt recommend "anyone with the link" setting.
(c) Sharing in connection with a merger, acquisition or reorganization
Canva may also share, sell or transfer your information to third parties in connection with or contemplation of (including as part of the due diligence process) any merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, bankruptcy or insolvency event involving Canva or any portion of our assets, services or businesses.

make changes to the Administered Account and billing settings and privacy preferences;
make changes to the folder permissions; and

If your Admin Entity has requested control of your Administered Account, Canva will provide you with notice and the opportunity to transfer your content and designs to a personal Canva account (subject to you providing us with a valid email address) before the Administered Account is transferred to your Admin Entity.
Summary: Where you use a work or managed email to set up an account, we might share information about the account with your employer or organization associated with the email address they manage and we might transfer control of the account to them.
(e) Sharing with other third parties

Request that their information be deleted or that we restrict access to it;

For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes on the rights of another user. In some cases, you may have shared your information with third parties, such as by publishing a design on a third party‚Äôs website. In that case Canva will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that third party directly.
If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you also have the option to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction. Where you have provided your consent to certain processing and no longer want us to use your information for that purpose, you may withdraw your consent to this use, although this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Please see paragraph

In this policy, a child is considered a person under the age of 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in the child‚Äôs country to be able to provide lawful consent to the processing of their personal data where the age is higher than 13 years old).
The Service and our content are not directed at children. Children are not permitted to sign up by themselves for the Service.
Other than as part of Canva for Education (set out below), Canva does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent where this is required, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

privacy@canva.com
‚Å†

Canva for Education:
Children who are students may use our
Canva for Education
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
service under the supervision of their teacher.
For the purposes of the Canva for Education product, a ‚ÄúStudent‚Äù means an individual enrolled in a K-12 school (or primary or secondary school for countries who do not use the K-12 designation) invited to use Canva for Education by a Teacher or administrator.
Canva's collection of student data is authorized by participating teachers and/or educational institutions obtaining parental consent or providing consent on behalf of the parent, if applicable, or as a proxy for the parent in certain circumstances. We will share student data with our third party service providers who have security, privacy, and data retention policies consistent with our policies and solely to the extent necessary for them to perform a business or technology support function for us. This may include data processing, account management or providing us with usage analytics. Canva does not sell student data.
The following third party service providers will process student data for the sole purpose of delivering the Canva for Education service. If a school deletes their Canva for Education account, or requests the deletion of personally identifiable information associated with a student‚Äôs account, Canva will direct these services to delete any such information they hold:
Provider (Purpose)
Amazon Web Services (data storage, service emails)
Amplitude (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Atlassian (user support)
Ada (chatbot for user support)
Appbot (user support)
Braze (email communications)
Canva Solutions, Inc. (user support)
Concentrix (user support)
Elastic (data logging)
Jira (user support)
Loggly (logging)
Looker (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Mode (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)

Sentry (error monitoring)
Serif (Europe) Limited (Affinity Software (as defined in the Affinity Additional Terms) and user support)
SheerID (teacher verification)
Slack (platform support)
Snowflake (data storage)
Zendesk (user support)
OpenAI (Canva AI products, only when enabled by the authorized school)
Annually, at or around the end of the school year, if a student account has not been logged into by a student for more than 12 months, we will send an email to the email address associated with that account to notify the student that their account will be deleted unless they log into such account. If the student does not log in to their account within 3 months following the receipt of that email, we will delete that account.
Upon termination of a school‚Äôs Canva for Education account, we will delete all student accounts associated with that school.
Educational institutions will have direct control of student data at all times. If a school wishes to inspect, review, amend or delete data we have collected from a student, they may submit an authorised request to
privacy@canva.com
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
or to any of the contact details provided in section 14 below. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the Canva for Education account. To protect children‚Äôs privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the school‚Äôs identity before granting access to any personal information.
If you are part of a Canva for Education Team, whether this is at a classroom or school level (‚Äú
School Team
‚Äù), the educational institution your Team is employed by or part of (‚Äú
District Team
‚Äù), may request to add your School Team to its District Team. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the District. To protect children‚Äôs privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the district's identity and relationship to the School Team before granting access to any personal information. If your Team is added to a District Team, then any information or content that you created in the School Team or activity you have taken within the School may be shared with the Team Owner of the District. If requested by the Team Owner of the District, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the School Team to District Team. You should ensure that any personal information, intellectual property or confidential information that you‚Äôd like to maintain ownership over is retained or moved to a separate personal account with an email address not issued by your employer.
Canva and its service providers may communicate directly with students for technical support purposes where requested by the student or their teacher. Canva may also send emails in relation to product changes, privacy changes and other service-related emails to students and teachers.
Students may use Canva Sites (as defined in our
Terms of Use
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
) if the functionality is enabled by their teacher, school or school district. These will not be indexed by search engines by default, meaning that they cannot be found by Google or another browser search and could only be accessed by people with the specific link. However, this default can be switched off by teachers so that the sites are indexed by search engines.
All designs in a Canva for Education account are private by default so that only people specifically added to the design can access it. A student may make their design public so that anyone with the link can access, view or edit it. But it will only be accessible to anonymous, non-logged in users if a teacher turns on anonymous collaboration (which is switched off by default). This might occur to facilitate collaboration with students that are not registered with Canva or have forgotten their password. This will allow them to view or edit a design.
(U.S. only): Canva for Education has been certified compliant with the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by
iKeepSafe
‚Å†
(opens in a new tab or window)
. Teachers and parents may contact us on +1 855 228 9195 (toll free) with inquiries concerning our Privacy Policy and use of children‚Äôs information.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you‚Äôre signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we‚Äôve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users ‚Äî from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you‚Äôll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you‚Äôre not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you‚Äôre using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you‚Äôre signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren‚Äôt signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information ‚Äî like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers ‚Äî for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you‚Äôre using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you‚Äôre using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you‚Äôve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that‚Äôs saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you‚Äôre using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device‚Äôs location on or off
using the device‚Äôs settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google‚Äôs Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google‚Äôs services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services ‚Äî for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google‚Äôs first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you‚Äôve already installed and videos you‚Äôve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for ‚Äúmountain bikes,‚Äù you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don‚Äôt show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don‚Äôt share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the ‚Äútap to call‚Äù button, we‚Äôll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we‚Äôll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google‚Äôs services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We‚Äôll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn‚Äôt covered in this Privacy Policy.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These ‚Äúserver logs‚Äù typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for ‚Äúcars‚Äù looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user‚Äôs ISP. Depending on the user‚Äôs service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they‚Äôve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device‚Äôs settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device‚Äôs unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you‚Äôre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account‚Äôs Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at

For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like ‚ÄúHey Google,‚Äù Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
