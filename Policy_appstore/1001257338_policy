Like most businesses, we use third-party service providers to deliver some of the services mentioned in this Privacy Policy. In doing so, we provide some of your data (including your personal information) to those third-party service providers, on a need-to-know basis.

Empower does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16 without seeking prior parental consent (if required by applicable law). We only use or disclose personal information about a child to the extent permitted by law, to seek parental consent pursuant to local law and regulations or to protect a child. The definitions of "child" or "children" may be slightly different as set forth in various applicable laws.
Security
We use physical administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal information. Any third-party service providers with whom we share your personal information agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal information and use it solely to provide their services to us.

Website and mobile application use
When you access our websites or mobile applications, we or our third-party suppliers use a variety of technologies, such as tags and web beacons, that automatically collect data (such as: without limitation, your device type, browser type, internet protocol address, operating system used, number of visits, average time spent on the site and pages viewed). This data is used to operate the websites more efficiently, maintain the security of your online session, improve our websites’ design and navigation, and perform online advertising (where permitted by law). If you have created an account with us, we may combine the data collected through the tracking systems described herein with other information we know about you, as permitted by law. We use this information internally to provide you with a better user experience and to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.
Some of our websites include links or navigation to third-party sites. These third-party sites may include informational sites, sites providing financial wellness tools and services, or services offered to you solely by a third party, as further described in the disclosures provided on such sites.
Cookies and web beacons
A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer, tablet, phone or other device by your web browser. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, web bugs or pixels) are small graphics with a unique identifier and are embedded invisibly on web pages. Empower and third- party service providers we hire may use such cookies and web beacons (collectively referred to below as “cookies”) to track the online movements of users of our websites and mobile applications, and to collect other data such as IP address, type of device used, and browser information. Empower and its third-party service providers use such data to customize your experience on our website and personalize our communications with you. With respect to emails that are sent to you, we or our service providers also use cookies and web beacons to determine when you receive and open our emails, whether you click any links in the email, and other information about the device from which you access the email, as permitted by law.
If you do not want to have cookies on your computer or device, you can use the link at the bottom of the webpage that is titled “Do not sell or share my personal information” to access a cookie manager in which you may refuse or deny certain types of cookies. Additionally, you can use the settings or tools offered on your browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. If you refuse or delete cookies, you may notice an impact on your use of Empower’s (and its affiliates’) websites; for example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account without additional authentication, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences.
Do not track and global privacy control
Some web browsers have the ability to activate a “do not track” signal. At this time, Empower does not respond to “do not track” signals; however, you may exercise your right to opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information through the use of the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal which allows you to communicate your privacy preference without having to make individualized opt out requests. To learn more about the GPC and how you can use it to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, you can visit their website
here
. If you've enabled the GPC signal in your browser, we will honor your opt out request as communicated via the GPC signal. Please note that these opt outs are specific to the device or browser you're using so you'll need to opt out again when you use a different device or browser, change your browser settings, or clear your cookies.
Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to help us understand how you interact with our website and mobile applications, to market our products and services to you, and to improve the user experience, , or regarding your receipt and access to information in emails we send to you.  Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used to navigate to this site. For more information about how Google uses data, see the site “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services,” here.
Interest-based advertising and communications
Empower advertises its products and services on its websites and mobile applications and on websites not affiliated with Empower, and we contract with third-party advertisers to place those advertisements. Empower and its suppliers may also send you advertising and communications that are tailored to you or that provide you with products or services that may be of interest to you, based on information that we or that such third-party service providers have collected about you. Such advertising may include advertising on websites not affiliated with Empower, such as social media. Our third-party advertising providers might use information collected from cookies or beacons about your use of our websites to provide interest-based advertisements based on your online activity as permitted by applicable law. If you would like information about how to opt-out of such interest- based advertising, you may find more information through the Network Advertising Initiative here.
Additional privacy rights under applicable state laws
Under state data privacy laws, you may have additional privacy rights as described below. As of the date of this privacy notice, this includes residents of California, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia (“you” or “your”).
Right to access: Subject to exemptions under applicable law, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data.
Specifically, you have the right to request the following:
The categories of personal information we collected about you;
The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
The business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information;
The categories of personal information that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we sold the particular category of personal information;
The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that particular category of personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Right to correct:
You have the right to request correction of your personal data that is inaccurate. Once we receive your verifiable request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate personal data as described in your request. You may be required to provide additional documentation if necessary to determine the accuracy of your personal data.
Right to delete:
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal data that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

Right to opt out:

If you reside in a state that requires an opt out for targeted advertising (as such term may be defined under applicable law), we will not engage in such activities, and will  not engage in “profiling” in any way that would require an opt out.
If you wish to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data pertaining to Empower’s use of third-party cookies as described
here
, you may do so by clicking on the “do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of this webpage, or if you are using a mobile app, by opting out in the Privacy Preference Center under the “Settings” section of your Profile.  In the future if you change browsers, devices, or clear your cookies, you will need to opt out again as described above. You may also opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information through the Global Privacy Control as described
here.
Please note that Empower will continue to share your data with service providers as permitted by law and described in this Privacy Policy.

When you access our websites or mobile applications, we or our third-party suppliers use a variety of technologies, such as tags and web beacons, that automatically collect data (such as: without limitation, your device type, browser type, internet protocol address, operating system used, number of visits, average time spent on the site and pages viewed). This data is used to operate the websites more efficiently, maintain the security of your online session, improve our websites’ design and navigation, and perform online advertising (where permitted by law). If you have created an account with us, we may combine the data collected through the tracking systems described herein with other information we know about you, as permitted by law. We use this information internally to provide you with a better user experience and to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.
Some of our websites include links or navigation to third-party sites. These third-party sites may include informational sites, sites providing financial wellness tools and services, or services offered to you solely by a third party, as further described in the disclosures provided on such sites.
Cookies and web beacons
A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer, tablet, phone or other device by your web browser. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, web bugs or pixels) are small graphics with a unique identifier and are embedded invisibly on web pages. Empower and third- party service providers we hire may use such cookies and web beacons (collectively referred to below as “cookies”) to track the online movements of users of our websites and mobile applications, and to collect other data such as IP address, type of device used, and browser information. Empower and its third-party service providers use such data to customize your experience on our website and personalize our communications with you. With respect to emails that are sent to you, we or our service providers also use cookies and web beacons to determine when you receive and open our emails, whether you click any links in the email, and other information about the device from which you access the email, as permitted by law.
If you do not want to have cookies on your computer or device, you can use the link at the bottom of the webpage that is titled “Do not sell or share my personal information” to access a cookie manager in which you may refuse or deny certain types of cookies. Additionally, you can use the settings or tools offered on your browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. If you refuse or delete cookies, you may notice an impact on your use of Empower’s (and its affiliates’) websites; for example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account without additional authentication, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences.
Do not track and global privacy control
Some web browsers have the ability to activate a “do not track” signal. At this time, Empower does not respond to “do not track” signals; however, you may exercise your right to opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information through the use of the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal which allows you to communicate your privacy preference without having to make individualized opt out requests. To learn more about the GPC and how you can use it to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, you can visit their website
here
. If you've enabled the GPC signal in your browser, we will honor your opt out request as communicated via the GPC signal. Please note that these opt outs are specific to the device or browser you're using so you'll need to opt out again when you use a different device or browser, change your browser settings, or clear your cookies.
Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to help us understand how you interact with our website and mobile applications, to market our products and services to you, and to improve the user experience, , or regarding your receipt and access to information in emails we send to you.  Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used to navigate to this site. For more information about how Google uses data, see the site “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services,” here.
Interest-based advertising and communications
Empower advertises its products and services on its websites and mobile applications and on websites not affiliated with Empower, and we contract with third-party advertisers to place those advertisements. Empower and its suppliers may also send you advertising and communications that are tailored to you or that provide you with products or services that may be of interest to you, based on information that we or that such third-party service providers have collected about you. Such advertising may include advertising on websites not affiliated with Empower, such as social media. Our third-party advertising providers might use information collected from cookies or beacons about your use of our websites to provide interest-based advertisements based on your online activity as permitted by applicable law. If you would like information about how to opt-out of such interest- based advertising, you may find more information through the Network Advertising Initiative here.

Specifically, you have the right to request the following:
The categories of personal information we collected about you;
The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
The business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information;
The categories of personal information that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we sold the particular category of personal information;
The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that particular category of personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Right to correct:
You have the right to request correction of your personal data that is inaccurate.

If you reside in a state that requires an opt out for targeted advertising (as such term may be defined under applicable law), we will not engage in such activities, and will  not engage in “profiling” in any way that would require an opt out.

Like most employers, we use third-party service providers for the business purposes described above. In doing so, we provide some of your data (including your personal information) to those third-party service providers, on a need-to-know basis. Our contracts with those service providers require them to safeguard your information and prohibit them from using your data for any purpose other than to provide services to us or to improve their services.
Identity verification and fraud analysis providers
We will share some of your personal information and detailed account information with third-party identity verification providers and fraud-analysis providers for the sole purpose of verifying your identity and preventing fraudulent transactions. These providers are required under contract with us to safeguard your information and not provide it to any third parties except as required to provide the services or as otherwise required by law, regulation, or court order.
Affiliate sharing
Certain personal information may be shared among our affiliates as permitted by law to provide our services to you, to make it easier to do business with us, and for their everyday business purposes.  We do not share your personal information with affiliates for their marketing purposes. Our affiliates are listed below in this policy and include, but are not limited to, our broker-dealer, our advisory service provider, and our trust company.
Nonaffiliated third parties
Your personal information may be shared with nonaffiliated third parties to provide services on our behalf. These third parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information and use it solely to provide their services to us.
Security, legal, and regulatory sharing
We also reserve the right to disclose information about you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of the services we provide and any facilities or equipment used to make those services available; (v) comply with any law or regulatory requirement, including pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process; or (vi) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements) or the rights, property, or safety of others.
Deidentified or pseudonymous data
We maintain and use deidentified data in such a way that any information can no longer be linked to you or any device associated with you. After data has been deidentified, i) we maintain and use such deidentified data without attempting to reidentify the data or re-associate it with specific individuals; ii) we take reasonable measures to ensure that the information cannot be reassociated with you or your household; and iii) we have implemented technical and organizational safeguards as well as business processes designed to prohibit the reidentification of your information. Such data is used for research and benchmarking purposes. We contractually obligate all recipients of the deidentified data to comply with applicable laws pertaining to deidentification and we monitor compliance with any contractual commitments.
Your rights and choices
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Right to know what personal information is being collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose
Subject to applicable exemptions in the CCPA, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.

The business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information;
The categories of personal information that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we sold the particular category of personal information;
The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that particular category of personal information; and
