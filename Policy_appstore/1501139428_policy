Legal
Privacy Policy
We work hard to keep all our legal mumbo jumbo as simple as possible, but we still have to have it.
This policy should be read in conjunction with SimplePay’s
Terms of
                    Service
,
Security Statement
and
POPI
page.
SimplePay is committed to protecting the privacy of your business and employees, whilst also developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. Our privacy policy has been created by combining the most stringent rules from the regions in which we operate. Therefore, all data handling and storage is done in full compliance with, and often in excess of the requirements laid out in POPI.
We are committed to helping you uphold your own and your employees’ rights over their personal information, whilst also making your obligations in meeting the requirements under data protection legislation as simple as possible.
Guiding Principles
Our commitment to protecting privacy is guided by our information security principles. These are as follows:
Processing Limitation
– We will only process the data you have provided to us, for the purpose which it was shared.
Accuracy
– We will endeavour to make it as easy as possible for you to keep your information up to date.
Data Minimisation
– If information you shared with us is no longer necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations, we shall ensure that any data which isn’t erased is in a non-identifiable form.
Openness
– We pride ourselves in exceptional customer service, helping make your life easier, whilst also guarding your interests. Therefore, should you require further explanation on a subject, we will happily clarify our role and involvement with you.
Consent
– If for any reason we should need to undertake further processing of information provided by you, we shall not do so without your consent, unless legally obliged.
Confidentiality
– Fundamentally, we want to give you peace of mind, so that you can share information with SimplePay with confidence! This will mean you can focus on the excellent service we provide.
Collection of Personal Information
You, the employer, collect personal information from your employees and provide this information to SimplePay, so that we can assist you with your payroll obligations. It is therefore presumed that in providing this information to SimplePay, you are authorised to do so.
Some of the personal information required is personally identifiable, such as an email address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Other non-identifiable information is also provided, such as anonymous demographic information, which is not unique, such as a person’s ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites.
Information about your computer hardware and software is automatically collected by SimplePay; this information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. SimplePay uses this information for the operation of the System, to maintain quality of the System, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the System.
Use of Personal Information
SimplePay collects and uses personal information to execute payroll services. SimplePay may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
SimplePay does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race or religion, without your explicit consent.
Save for circumstances where we have your express consent, the information that SimplePay collects is not shared with or sold to other organisations for commercial purposes. SimplePay will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SimplePay;
protect and defend the rights or property of SimplePay by taking action in situations including, but not limited to, suspected illegal activities, fraud or violations of Terms of Service; and
act under exigent circumstances, including but not limited to situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, whether employees or users of SimplePay or members of the public.
Should SimplePay or the System merge with or be acquired by another entity, your information will be transferred subject to the provision of reasonable notice by SimplePay.
Security and Storage of Personal Information
Each region in which SimplePay operates is assigned a data protection officer (DPO), whose role is to ensure that the company remains compliant with data protection legislation and honours this policy. Our continued commitment to protect our clients’ personal information is exemplified by SimplePay’s current pursuit of the ISO 27001 accreditation for our information security management system.
SimplePay stores the information provided by you, however you retain all rights to such information.
SimplePay secures your personal information against any unauthorised access, use or disclosure. The personally identifiable information you provide is held on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment. The transfer of data is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Please see our Security Statement for further details on the above.
Use of Cookies
One of the primary purposes of cookies is convenience; cookies save you time by telling the server that you have returned to a specific page. This allows you to store certain information such as username and password, simplifying the process of accessing the System.
SimplePay also uses Google Analytics which makes use of cookies to store anonymous data. This data is not shared with any third parties. No personal information is collected or stored unless you explicitly capture it through one of the forms on the System.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
Changes to This Policy
SimplePay may, from time to time, update its policy and so encourages you to periodically visit this page in order to review any changes made. SimplePay will also notify you by e-mail of any significant changes.
SimplePay welcomes any feedback that you may have regarding this Policy. Furthermore, if you believe that SimplePay has not adhered to this Policy, please contact SimplePay at legal@simplepay.co.za and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
