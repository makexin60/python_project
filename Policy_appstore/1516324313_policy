11. Your Data Protection Rights
You have various rights under Data Protection Laws, subject to certain exemptions, in connection with our processing of your personal data, including those set out in the table below.
Data Protection Right
Explanation
Access and Information
You are entitled to receive, on request and free of charge, a copy of all your personal data that we hold together with other information about the processing of that personal data. There are some limitations to this right. For example, if the personal data also relates to another person and we do not have that person’s consent, or if the personal data is subject to legal privilege. Where there is data that we cannot disclose, we will explain this to you.
Rectification of your personal data
You may request to have inaccurate or incomplete information corrected and updated by us.
Erasure of your personal data
This right enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing. However, where we hold and process your personal data in order to comply with legal obligations, such as compliance with tax, or for the establishment exercise or defence of legal claims, your right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data is limited.
Object to processing
You may object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) in order to justify the basis for our processing your personal data and there is something about your particular situation which makes you wish to object to processing on this ground.
Request restriction of  processing of your personal data
This right enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data (e.g. if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it).
Data Portability
Where we process your personal data by automated means (i.e. not on paper) and this processing is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract between us, you are entitled, where technically feasible to request that we transmit your personal data in this format to another controller.
Not be subject to a solely automated decision.
You have the right to be informed if your personal data will be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling, where that decision impacts on your legal rights. Profiling is an automated form of processing of personal data often used to analyse or predict personal aspects about an individual person. We do not engage in profiling.
The right to complain to the Data Protection Commission
You have the right to make a complaint in respect of our compliance with Data Protection Laws to the Data Protection Commission, the supervisory authority in Ireland.
