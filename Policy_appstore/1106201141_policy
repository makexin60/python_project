We‚Äôve used Plann for yeeeears and we absolutely love the platform & brand itself. It‚Äôs a social media content planning tool that is always ahead of the game, like an AI Instagram caption generator, helping us adapt quickly as social features are launched. We‚Äôre customers for life!

The Clique Social
Social Media Manager
I‚Äôve tried sooo social many schedulers but none of them provided me with the EXACT tools I was looking for - until now! I have a secret weapon, and it‚Äôs called Plann.
Arden Interiors
Interior Designer
It's absolutely my favorite content planning app. I love the way it has a visual feature to see what your posts will actually look like on the grid once published (with an option to move around). Plus, all you need to prepare content in advance.
Heaps Good Marketing

I love @plannthat for all of my social scheduling needs and the upgrades that keep coming on desktop and mobile ü•∞. Plan ahead once a week or month, set aside time to work your butt off, and you will nail it! üíÖ
