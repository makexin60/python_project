Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City Privacy Policy
At Snowman your privacy is very important to us and we respect the privacy rights of every customer that interacts with our studio or with our game, Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City on Apple Arcade. To show how seriously we take this responsibility, we have created the Privacy Policy below to help guide you on how we collect, store, and use any information you may provide us with. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and feel free to let us know if you have any questions..
1. Application
This Privacy Policy describes how ‘Built by Snowman’ collects, uses and discloses information along with what choices you have with respect to that information. This Privacy Policy applies whenever you access Snowman’s game Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City on Apple Arcade, or interact with our studio or customer support team via email or our website – http://builtbysnowman.com/ – henceforth collectively referred to as our Services. By using any of our Services, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access or use our Services.
2. What information do we collect and how/why do we use it?
Personally-identifiable information is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you online or offline. Where possible we minimize any personal information collected when you use our Services and do not collect any through or about the usage of our game, Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City on Apple Arcade.
The information we do collect is used for the below purposes:
To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services;
To improve the play experience of our games;
to respond to your comments and questions and communicate with you;
for account management and other administrative matters;
to prevent and investigate fraud and other misuses;
and to protect our rights or our property.
While we do not collect personal information through our game Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City, here is a description of how non-identifiable information is collected:
In Game on Apple Arcade: When you play Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City, gameplay data such as preferences and progress/unlock save files are stored in your iCloud account storage to sync your game progress across devices. If you are signed in to Game Center on your Apple device, Apple will receive your gameplay activity, including scores and achievements. We do not receive or store this data on our servers.
To further protect this information, we use a one-way hash of your device name to uniquely associate save data with your device and, if you are logged in to identify you as a player, a unique ID from Game Center. These are both stored within the filenames of your save data on your local device and, if you have iCloud syncing enabled, the filenames are also used to identify your save data within iCloud. It is important to note that we do not send this information to any external servers outside of Apple or keep a record of it anywhere outside of your local device and iCloud (if you have syncing enabled). Deleting the game from your device will remove the local copies of the save data unless you instruct the device to retain this information manually.
This information is only stored on your local device, and in your iCloud account if you have iCloud enabled. By encoding this information with a one-way hash, someone cannot extract this information unless they already have it.
When contacting us directly for support, here are the ways in which we collect personal information:

Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

Remote storage of any data can be prevented by removing a child account’s access to iCloud through Apple’s Parental Controls.
If a child under the age of 13 contacts us directly for customer support, we take additional steps to protect their privacy, including:
Requesting their legal guardians consent for the collection of personal information from the child for the purposes of the customer support request.
