Any questions?
Which Famileo subscription should you choose?
You have the choice of 4 subscription plans. They are all non-binding and automatically renewed each month unless the managing member cancels the subscription:
- The
Monthly
plan (£5.99 or €5.99/month and
Monthly+
plan (£6.99 or €6.99/month) allow you to send a gazette every 4 weeks. This is a great option for families with fewer than 10 members.
- If you have a large family and would like to regularly share photos, the
Bi-monthly
plan (£9.99 or €9.99/month for a gazette every two weeks) or the
Weekly
plan (£17.99 or €17.99/month – for a gazette every week) will be the best options.
You can change your subscription plan at any time.

to subscribe your family.
Does your loved one live in one of our partnered care homes?
If so, your loved one’s care home will offer you a subscription for free! Click on "Sign up" via the Famileo home page, then "Enter my family code" to enter the code provided by the care home.
How long will it take for the Famileo gazette to arrive?
The gazettes are automatically generated on Mondays so you can take advantage of the weekend to post your final messages.
They are then printed and dispatched within 3 days. After that, the postal delivery time is typically 4 to 6 working days. Most gazettes therefore arrive between Monday and Friday the following week. Delivery times may be longer for addresses outside of the UK and Ireland.
To which countries can I send the Famileo gazette?
You can send the gazette anywhere in the world, at no extra cost.
How can I share the cost of the Famileo subscription between family members?
Does your loved one(s) live at home?
When you subscribe, the person who starts the subscription will be asked to enter a bank card, which will be considered the default payment method.
After that, you can choose:
Either the subscription cost is debited from the default bank card,
Or you wish to share the cost by using the family kitty function, which is available to all family members from the menu. Everyone can contribute by adding the amount they want.
Does your loved one live in a partner care home?
If so, your loved one's care home will offer you a subscription for free!
How can I give Famileo as a last-minute gift to my grandparents?
Is the big day just a few weeks away?
You can start your Famileo journey right now and choose the date of your first gazette. When making your choice, please consider the delivery times.
