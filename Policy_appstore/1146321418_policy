User Consent to FashionTIY’s Privacy Policy
By accessing or otherwise using FashionTIY, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.

Collection of Information
Personal Information that You Provide: In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through FashionTIY. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on FashionTIY. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of FashionTIY, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of FashionTIY, such as your year of birth, gender, and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of FashionTIY, such as photos, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends who use FashionTIY, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. When you purchase items, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information, which we may collect and store, so that we can process your payment for the items. When you sign up for FashionTIY or engage in other activities that we make available on FashionTIY, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number. We will also collect transactional information based on your activity on FashionTIY, such as buying, billing, and any other information you provide to purchase or ship items. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related information.
FashionTIY may require you to submit additional personal information to authenticate yourself if we believe you are violating FashionTIY policies, such as identification or a utility bill to verify your address. If you do not wish to share such information with us, you will be unable to complete any further transactions on FashionTIY.
Personal Information from Other Sources: We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.

We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through FashionTIY or the social network from which you have connected to FashionTIY (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other websites with whom you have registered to receive such notifications.

Information Collected Via Technology: As you use FashionTIY, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, type of device, operating system, and the address of the referring website. We may also place small data files on your computer or other devices. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, Flash Cookies, Silverlight Cookies, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications ("Cookies"). We use these technologies to recognize you as a customer; customize FashionTIY Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud, and to promote trust and safety across our site. We use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. In order to use our Services offered through FashionTIY, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of FashionTIY may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our Services. This type of information is collected to make FashionTIY and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with FashionTIY to meet your special interests and needs.
We engage in remarketing to market our sites across the web. When a user visits our site, a cookie is placed on the user’s computer. Users with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive relevant advertisements. You may opt-out of this ad serving using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page.
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

As discussed throughout this Privacy Policy, FashionTIY makes it easy for you to access, correct, delete, or demand deletion of your Personal Data. You may object to our processing of your Personal data by emailing us, although if you prohibit our processing, it may make some of our Services either impossible to offer or less useful.

Privacy Shield Frameworks
FashionTIY complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
Your right to access your Personal Information may be restricted in exceptional circumstances, including, but not limited to, when the burden or expense of providing this access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or when the rights of persons other than you would be violated by the provision of such access. If we determine that your access should be restricted in a particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of our determination and respond to any inquiries you may have.
We will also provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their Personal Information with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to tiy@fashiontiy.com.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, FashionTIY commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.
