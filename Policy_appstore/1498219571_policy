​
Goss respects your privacy, and is committed to making our practices regarding your data more transparent and fair. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and share your personal data, and it applies whenever you visit our Site, install our App and play our Games, interact with us or otherwise access or use any of our Services.
Specifically, it describes our policy regarding the following below.
​

You are not legally required to provide us with any Personal Data, but without it we will not be able to provide you with the full range or with the best experience of using our Services.
IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS GOVERNED BY AND INTEGRATED EXPRESSLY INTO OUR TERMS OF USE. THE TERMS OF USE EXPRESSLY APPLY TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERS.
​
1. Data Collection
​
We collect four main categories of data (and to the extent it may enable the identification of a specific person, or is linked to such potentially identifying data, we will deem it as "Personal Data"):
​
Data automatically collected or generated: when someone visits, interacts with or uses our Services, including any e-mail or text messages sent to them by us or via our Services, we may collect or generate technical data about them. We collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third party services (as detailed in Sections 4 and 6 below), including through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in Section 7 below). Such data consists of connectivity, technical or aggregated usage data, such as IP address, unique advertising ID, non-identifying data regarding a device, operating system, browser or App version, mobile carrier, locale and language settings, user activity on our Services, and in-App or Game events.We do not use such data to learn a person's true identity or contact details, but mostly to have a better understanding on how our users typically use and engage with our Services. The use of such technical and device data also helps us and our partners to deliver interest-based or otherwise more effective advertisements and content, to optimize our ad management and our users' viewing experience), and to improve the overall performance and your user experience of our Services. For more information about our advertising uses, please see Section 4 below.
Data received from you: you may provide us Personal Data voluntarily, such as when you contact us (through Facebook, Messenger, e-mail or any other channel, including any support services), when you post on our public forums or groups, when you provide us your e-mail address (such as when you sign-up to receive e-mail updates or gifts), when you place any purchases in any of our Games, when you upload a profile image from your device gallery or directly using its camera, when you interact with other users or when you choose to connect your Facebook account to any of our Games.
Data received from Facebook and other channels: Once you connect the Game to your Facebook account, we will receive access to your Facebook public profile, including (to the extent you defined it as "public") your full name, (e-mail address provided to Facebook), gender, locale, time zone, and a list of your friends playing the Game. This will also allow us to present your and your friends' public profile pictures inside the Game, however we will not retain them on our servers longer than the time needed to pass them from Facebook to the App. In addition, we or our advertising partners may receive from Facebook and our other marketing channels general information concerning the performance of our advertising campaigns, such as the targeted age group or interests, and we or our partners may be able to link such general data to any other data in our possession (to learn more about our advertising practices, please read Section 4 below). If you access our Services through a third party such as Facebook ( or Snapchat) or connect our Services to any third-party account, you should also read their terms and conditions and privacy policy. If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please visit that third-party's application's website in order to learn more about their privacy practices.
Transaction Data: In-Game purchases will typically be processed by the relevant platform provider (e.g. Apple, Google or Facebook), and we will not collect or store your financial data, e.g. your credit card numbers or bank account. We may still however receive your non-financial Personal Data related to the purchase, such as your name, billing address, e-mail address and the items purchased, in order to fulfil your purchase and for our accounting purposes.
​

​
3. Advertising Uses
​
Our Games may include advertising for third party services and products. We and our advertising partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying interest-based advertising, as well as targeting and ad measurement and attribution systems.
​
Such data includes your device advertising identifiers (e.g. IDFA, to the extent available), data related to your connected Facebook profile (if any, such as your gender, region or country), and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 3 above). Please note that we do not share the data you provide us through your connected Facebook account with our advertising partners.
​
The ads we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Games, our Services, or through other channels, such as third party websites and applications.
​
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or employees or service providers that we do not manage. Any information you provide to sites, applications or services advertised through our Services will be covered by their applicable privacy policies specified therein. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of any third-party applications, services and sites that you visit or provide permission to access your information. It is those third parties' responsibility to protect any information you give them, so we will not be held liable for their use of your personally identifying information.
​
How to adjust your preferences regarding interest-based advertising
If you wish to prevent the use of your device's advertising ID or other identifiers for interest-based advertising, you may change your device settings to reset such advertising ID or opt-out of such advertising (typically, this is available under the "Privacy" or "Ads" section in your device settings).
​
If you live in the USA, Canada or Europe, you can also opt-out from the collection of your data by our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, by visiting
www.aboutads.info/choices
(for US users),
www.youradchoices.ca/choices
(for Canadian users) or
www.yourchoicesonline.com
(for European users).
​
Please note that if you reset your advertising ID or opt-out of interest based advertising, you may still see advertisements in our Games, or on any other channels, but those ads will not be targeted based on the above mentioned identifiers. For example, such ads may be instead based on context, such as your progress and actions in the Game, or your language preferences. Please note that such actions may result in a less enjoyable user experience.
​

​
A "cookie" is a small text file that is used, for example, to collect data about activity on our Site. Some cookies and other technologies serve to recall Personal Data, such as an IP address, previously indicated by the user.

Some of the cookies we use are associated with your account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.
While we do not change our practices in response to a "Do Not Track" signal in the HTTP header from a browser or mobile application, most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, we cannot guarantee that our Services will fully operate should you choose to block cookies. For example, any preferences you may have defined on our Site or App will not be saved.
