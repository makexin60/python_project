In principle, any collection, use and transmission of information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information") through our products is subject to your prior, express consent.
Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 a) GDPR serves our company as the legal basis for processing transactions in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 b) GDPR. The same applies to such processing processes that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of enquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, for example to fulfil tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 c) GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 f) GDPR. Processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail.
b. Necessity of recording:
Typically, this information is required when you use our services, make a purchase, register your product online or provide us with your personal information so that we can contact you.
To this end, we may ask you to provide information, including your name, e-mail address, country, language and payment information, during registration or registration of your software.

Certain services require the transfer of information about already installed Nero products to recommend suitable upgrades or program modules, for example. This data is processed anonymously.
c. Anonymous usage:
Even if you do not wish to register or transfer personal data, you can still use most of the features of our software. 
However, the use of certain services or functions may require registration and/or transmission of information such as your personal serial number.
d. Disclosure by user:
With some Nero products, including NeroKwik online services and applications, users can share and share their content with others. By using these options, we may receive information from these users that is necessary to provide these features, such as your email address.
e. Your content:
With some Nero products, including NeroKwik online services and applications, users can store, access, manage, edit, share, and synchronize (e.g., image, video, and audio data) files ("content") stored on their PCs and mobile devices or made available through third-party services on and through Nero Servers. To use these products and features, Nero must collect and store the content, including associated metadata such as file name, bit rate, geoinformation, change dates, descriptions, tags, and any other information contained in the files, in order to provide the services.
f. Device and log file data:
Some Nero products, including the NeroKwik online services and applications, are made available to users on various devices. Depending on the device used, the following information may be collected solely for the purpose of enabling Nero to provide the services: Device ID, device name, and partition information of the device.
g. Product improvement program:
Certain Nero products allow users to participate in a product improvement program. By participating in these programs, you agree that Nero may collect and transfer information from your system about your use of Nero software. Some applications use Google Analytics, an analysis service of Google Inc. "("Google") to enable the analysis of the use of the application. The information generated by Google Analytics about your use is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if third parties process the information on Google's behalf. 
This information is not personal in nature and is anonymously sent to a security server where it is analyzed and used to improve Nero software products. No data about the contents of the user is collected.
Google has signed and certified itself under the Privacy Shield Agreement between the European Union and the USA. By doing so, Google undertakes to comply with the standards and regulations of European data protection law. Further information can be found in the following linked entry:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active
. 
The following information is collected: Product name, installed applications, version, time and date of installation, country (according to the operating system settings), version of the operating system and number of program and function calls, device properties, user's region information and language. 
The user may opt out of the product improvement program at any time by deactivating the service in the software settings.
h. Patent activation:
Some Nero products and applications only work with third-party technology. Some of these technologies are integrated into this version as versions with limited functionality (demo versions) or without functionality. Online activations give users unrestricted access to these technologies so that they can take full advantage of the software's functionality and prevent misuse. An Internet connection or a fax machine is required for activation. Nero only transfers and processes data needed to activate these third-party technologies.
The software only transfers this data if you have given your consent.
Apart from your IP address, no personal information is transmitted to Nero. You do not need to provide your name or other personal information during activation.
i. Accuracy of the data:

3. Integration of third-party services
Some Nero products give users access to features and information from third parties, including without limitation Facebook, Dropbox, Myspace, and Youtube ("Third Party Services"). Please note that Nero is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such services or the way they collect information.
Access to third-party services and features requires an account and verification. Access to third-party services is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.
a. Facebook:
Our products include features of the social network Facebook.com.
A social network is an Internet-based social meeting place, an online community that usually enables users to communicate with each other and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enables the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Facebook enables social network users to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friendship requests, among other things.
Facebook is operated by Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The entity responsible for the processing of personal data if a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Each time a function on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) is integrated, the Internet browser on the person's information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. An overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_DE.
As part of this technical process, Facebook is informed about which function is used by the person concerned.
This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned by Facebook to the respective Facebook account of the person concerned. If the person concerned clicks one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the person concerned and stores this personal data.
If the person concerned does not want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent it from being transmitted by logging out of their Facebook account before calling up our website.
The data policy published by Facebook, which is available at
https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/
, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the person concerned. In addition, various applications are available that make it possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the person concerned to suppress data transmission to Facebook.

.
c. Youtube:
Nero has integrated YouTube components into its products. YouTube is an Internet video portal that allows video publishers to post video clips and other users to view, rate and comment on them free of charge. YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, which is why complete film and television programmes, music videos, trailers or videos produced by users themselves can be called up via the Internet portal.
YouTube is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
Each time a YouTube component (YouTube video) is integrated into a function, the YouTube component causes the product to download a representation of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube. More information about YouTube can be found at
https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/
.
If the person concerned is logged on to YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which specific function of our product the person concerned is visiting with the call. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the person concerned.
If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desired by the person concerned, this can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before calling up our website.
The data protection regulations published by YouTube, which can be accessed at
https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy
, provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.
d. Myspace:
Nero has integrated Myspace LLC components into its products. Myspace is a so-called social network. A social network is an Internet-based social meeting place, an online community that usually enables users to communicate with each other and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enables the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Myspace allows social network users to set up free user profiles containing photos and videos, blogs or groups, among other things.
Myspace is operated by Myspace LLC, 8391 Beverly Blvd. #349, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.
Each time a function is called in which a myspace component (myspace plug-in) is integrated, the product is automatically prompted by the respective myspace component to download a representation of the corresponding myspace component from myspace. More information about Myspace can be found at
https://myspace.com
. In the context of this technical procedure, Myspace is informed about which specific function is used by the person concerned.
If the affected person is logged on to Myspace at the same time, Myspace recognizes which concrete function of our products the affected person uses with each call of the function by the affected person. This information is collected by the Myspace component and assigned by Myspace to the respective Myspace account of the person concerned.
If such a transmission of this information to Myspace is not wanted by the person concerned, he can prevent the transmission by logging out of his Myspace account before calling our website.
The privacy policy published by Myspace, which can be accessed at
https://myspace.com/pages/privacy
, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Myspace.

a. Facebook:
Our websites include plug-ins from the social network Facebook.com.
A social network is an Internet-based social meeting place, an online community that usually enables users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enable the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Facebook enables social network users to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend requests, among other things.

Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the controller and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the person's information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. An overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_DE
. 
As part of this technical process, Facebook is informed about which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person concerned.
If the person concerned is logged on to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific subpage of our website the person concerned visits with every visit to our website and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective Facebook account of the person concerned. If the person concerned clicks one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the person concerned and stores this personal data.

c. Tracking pixels:
Our website uses so-called tracking pixels to track commercial data. These are used to understand the effectiveness of advertising-related communication.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
d. Google Analytics:
We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google has signed and certified itself under the Privacy Shield Agreement between the European Union and the USA. By doing so, Google undertakes to comply with the standards and regulations of European data protection law. Further information can be found in the following linked entry:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000000001L5AAI&status=Active
. 

Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website by page visitors is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address from within Member States of the European Union or from within other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server located in the USA and shortened there. IP anonymization is active on this website. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services relating to website and Internet use.
The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
You can also prevent the transmission to Google of data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link:

e. Adobe Analytics / Omniture
Nero AG has integrated Adobe components on this website. Adobe Analytics (Omniture) or the Adobe Marketing Cloud (hereinafter referred to as "Omniture") is a tool that enables more efficient online marketing and web analysis. Omniture is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. The Adobe Marketing Cloud enables real-time analysis of visitor flows on websites. The real-time analyses include project reports and allow an ad-hoc analysis of website visitors. Customer interactions are presented in a way that provides the controller with a better overview of the online activities of the users of this website by displaying the data in simple and interactive dashboards and converting them into reports. This enables the processor to receive information in real time and identify problems more quickly.
The operator of these services is Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland.
Omniture places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned (cookies have already been explained in advance; this can be read above). Server settings ensure that tracking records sent to Adobe's data center are anonymized prior to geolocalization. Anonymization is implemented by replacing the last part of the IP address. Nero AG has made server-side settings on the basis of which the IP address of the person concerned is anonymized independently of one another for geolocalization and range measurement prior to processing. Adobe will use the data and information collected via our website to evaluate the user behaviour of the data subject on behalf of the data controller. Adobe will also use the information to generate reports on user activity on our behalf and to provide other services to our company in connection with the use of our website. Adobe does not combine the IP address of the person concerned with other personal data.
The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Omniture from placing a cookie on the person's information technology system. In addition, the cookies already set by Omniture can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, the data subject has the possibility to object to and prevent the collection of data generated by the Adobe cookie and related to the use of this website as well as the processing of this data by Adobe. To do this, the person concerned must press the unsubscribe button under the link http://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/opt-out.html, which sets an opt-out cookie. The opt-out cookie set with the objection is stored on the information technology system used by the person concerned. If the cookies are deleted on the system of the person concerned after an objection, the person concerned must call up the link again and set a new opt-out cookie.
By enabling the opt-out cookie, however, it is possible that the Internet pages of the data controller may no longer be fully usable by the data subject.

7. The usage of „cookies“
a. Use of cookies:
We use so-called session cookies to optimize our online offer. A session cookie is a small text file that is sent by the respective servers when you visit a website and stored temporarily on your hard drive. This file as such contains a so-called session ID, with which you can assign various requests of your browser to the common session. This will allow your computer to be recognized when you return to our website. These cookies are deleted after you close your browser. They are used, for example, to enable you to use the shopping basket function across several pages.
We also use persistent cookies (also small text files that are stored on your terminal device) to a small extent, which remain on your device and enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit. These cookies are stored on your hard drive and are deleted automatically after a specified time. Their life span is 1 month to 10 years. This enables us to present our services to you in a more user-friendly, effective and secure manner and, for example, to display information on the website that is specifically tailored to your interests.
Our legitimate interest in the use of cookies pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR is to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure.
The following data and information are stored in the cookies:
-	login information
-	language settings
-	entered search terms
-	information on the number of visits to our website and use of individual functions of our website.
When the cookie is activated, it is assigned an identification number and your personal data is not assigned to this identification number. Your name, IP address or similar data that would enable the cookie to be assigned to you will not be inserted in the cookie. Based on the cookie technology, we only receive pseudonymous information, for example about which pages of our shop have been visited, which products have been viewed, etc. We do not collect any personal data from you.
In addition, we use this information to automatically enter your data in forms so that you do not have to re-enter it yourself. The use of cookies is widespread and offers many advantages. Cookies are used on most large websites. The information contained in cookies about how and when visitors use a website helps us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Numerous improvements and updates are based on information collected with cookies. In addition, cookies help us to offer customized web content and to satisfy the needs of our visitors. So-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted after closing the browser, are required, among other things, to carry out online purchasing processes.
b. Sensitive data:
Our websites do not use cookies to collect personal information on your computer that was not sent as a cookie the first time you visited the website.
c. Blocking cookies:
You can manage the use of cookies yourself or block them completely by configuring your browser accordingly. For example, you can set your browser so that you are informed in advance about the setting of cookies and can decide in individual cases whether you want to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, or whether cookies are completely prevented. The steps for changing these settings may vary depending on your operating system and browser. If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps: Under "Tools", select "Internet Options", click on the "Privacy" tab and click on "Advanced". Here you can completely block the use of cookies, which can however limit the functions of the website or web-based programs.
8. Applications and application process
We collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of handling the application procedure. Processing may also be carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant sends corresponding application documents to the controller by electronic means, for example by e-mail or via a web form on the website. If Nero concludes an employment contract with an applicant based on the application, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If Nero does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted after notification of the rejection decision, provided that there are no other legitimate interests of the data controller preventing such deletion. Other legitimate interest in this sense is, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).
III. Data security, storage time
1. Data Security
We make every effort to ensure the security of your data in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and our technical possibilities.
Your personal data will be transmitted encrypted. This applies to your orders and also to the customer login.

A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
To secure your data, we maintain technical and organisational security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, which we constantly improve to the state of the art.
Furthermore, we do not guarantee that our offer will be available at certain times; disruptions, interruptions or failures cannot be ruled out. The servers we use are regularly and carefully secured.
2. Storage time
We process and store personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the storage purpose or insofar as this has been provided for by the European Directive and Ordinance Giver or another legislator in laws or regulations to which we are subject.

Nero reserves the right to change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice by posting such changes, updates, or modifications on the website.

Any such change, update or modification shall be effective immediately upon posting it on the website.
Nero recommends that you read this Statement periodically to keep up to date with the measures taken to protect your personal information.
4. Newsletter
a. Registration:
By registering on our websites or otherwise using our services, customers can choose whether to receive the Nero newsletter in the future. In this newsletter customers receive information about special offers, updates, programs, new products and/or services.
In order to be able to send you our newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure. Only if you have expressly confirmed to us beforehand that you wish to receive the newsletter we will send you an activation e-mail and ask you to confirm that you wish to receive our newsletter by clicking on a link contained in this e-mail.
If you register for our newsletter (e.g. via contact form or e-mail), we store your e-mail address and the data provided for sending future newsletters.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
b. Product recommendation:
We will regularly send you product recommendations via e-mail as part of our newsletters. In this way, we can provide you with information about products from our product range that you may be interested in based on your recent purchases from us. In doing so, we strictly comply with legal requirements. You can object to this at any time.
c. Tracking pixels:
Our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in e-mails sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows for statistical evaluations of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns to be carried out. On the basis of the embedded pixel-code we can recognize whether and when an e-mail was opened by an affected person and which links in the e-mail were called by the affected person.

5. Links to other Websites
This website contains links to other websites. Please note that Nero is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites or for the possible collection of any information therein.
Please read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully, as it may differ from our privacy policy. In this respect, our data protection declaration applies exclusively to the websites listed above.
6. Integration of functions of third party providers
a. Facebook:
Our websites include plug-ins from the social network Facebook.com.
A social network is an Internet-based social meeting place, an online community that usually enables users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences or enable the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Facebook enables social network users to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend requests, among other things.
Facebook is operated by Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The legal entity responsible for the processing of personal data if a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the controller and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the person's information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. An overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_DE
. 
As part of this technical process, Facebook is informed about which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person concerned.
If the person concerned is logged on to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific subpage of our website the person concerned visits with every visit to our website and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective Facebook account of the person concerned. If the person concerned clicks one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the person concerned and stores this personal data.
Facebook receives information via the Facebook component that the person concerned has visited our website whenever the person concerned is logged on to Facebook at the same time as accessing our website; this happens regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the person concerned does not want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent it from being transmitted by logging out of their Facebook account before calling up our website.
The data policy published by Facebook, which is available at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the person concerned. In addition, various applications are available that make it possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the person concerned to suppress data transmission to Facebook.
b. SocialTwist:
We offer functions of various social media platforms on our websites. This is made possible through the use of SocialTwist.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
For more information about SocialTwist's collection and use of information, your rights in this regard and other ways to protect your privacy in connection with the services of SocialTwist, please see the privacy policy at
http://tellafriend.socialtwist.com/privacy-policy
.
c. Tracking pixels:
Our website uses so-called tracking pixels to track commercial data. These are used to understand the effectiveness of advertising-related communication.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
d. Google Analytics:
We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google has signed and certified itself under the Privacy Shield Agreement between the European Union and the USA. By doing so, Google undertakes to comply with the standards and regulations of European data protection law. Further information can be found in the following linked entry:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000000001L5AAI&status=Active.
.
Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website by page visitors is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 f) GDPR.
However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address from within Member States of the European Union or from within other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server located in the USA and shortened there. IP anonymization is active on this website. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services relating to website and Internet use.
The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
You can also prevent the transmission to Google of data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link:
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
.
As an alternative to the browser plug-in or within browsers on mobile devices, you can click the following link to set an opt-out cookie to prevent future collection by Google Analytics within this website (this opt-out cookie only works in this browser and only for this domain. If you delete the cookies in your browser, you must click this link again): Disable Google Analytics
e. Adobe Analytics / Omniture
Nero AG has integrated Adobe components on this website. Adobe Analytics (Omniture) or the Adobe Marketing Cloud (hereinafter referred to as "Omniture") is a tool that enables more efficient online marketing and web analysis. Omniture is part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. The Adobe Marketing Cloud enables real-time analysis of visitor flows on websites. The real-time analyses include project reports and allow an ad-hoc analysis of website visitors. Customer interactions are presented in a way that provides the controller with a better overview of the online activities of the users of this website by displaying the data in simple and interactive dashboards and converting them into reports. This enables the processor to receive information in real time and identify problems more quickly.
The operator of these services is Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland.
Omniture places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned (cookies have already been explained in advance; this can be read above). Server settings ensure that tracking records sent to Adobe's data center are anonymized prior to geolocalization. Anonymization is implemented by replacing the last part of the IP address. Nero AG has made server-side settings on the basis of which the IP address of the person concerned is anonymized independently of one another for geolocalization and range measurement prior to processing. Adobe will use the data and information collected via our website to evaluate the user behaviour of the data subject on behalf of the data controller. Adobe will also use the information to generate reports on user activity on our behalf and to provide other services to our company in connection with the use of our website. Adobe does not combine the IP address of the person concerned with other personal data.
The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Omniture from placing a cookie on the person's information technology system. In addition, the cookies already set by Omniture can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, the data subject has the possibility to object to and prevent the collection of data generated by the Adobe cookie and related to the use of this website as well as the processing of this data by Adobe. To do this, the person concerned must press the unsubscribe button under the link http://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/opt-out.html, which sets an opt-out cookie. The opt-out cookie set with the objection is stored on the information technology system used by the person concerned. If the cookies are deleted on the system of the person concerned after an objection, the person concerned must call up the link again and set a new opt-out cookie.
By enabling the opt-out cookie, however, it is possible that the Internet pages of the data controller may no longer be fully usable by the data subject.

Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung
Welche Informationskategorien wir verwenden, warum wir deine Informationen Daten aufgrund der Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung verarbeiten und wie die Verarbeitung erfolgt, ist nachstehend dargelegt:
Warum und wie wir deine Informationen verarbeiten
Informationskategorien, die wir verwenden (mehr über die einzelnen Informationskategorien erfährst du unter „
Welche Informationen erheben wir?
“). Welche Informationen wir tatsächlich verwenden, hängt von deinen tatsächlichen Umständen ab, könnte aber Folgendes umfassen:
Für die Verarbeitung von Informationen, wenn dies nach dem Gesetz erforderlich ist: Wenn wir zur Offenlegung von Informationen verpflichtet sind, beispielsweise wenn wir eine gültige rechtliche Anfrage für bestimmte Informationen erhalten (etwa einen irischen Durchsuchungsbeschluss) werden wir auf deine Informationen zugreifen, sie aufbewahren und/oder sie an Aufsichtsbehörden, Strafverfolgungsbehörden oder andere weitergeben.
Die Art und Weise, wie die Informationen verarbeitet werden, hängt von den jeweiligen Umständen hab. Mehr dazu erfährst du unter
Wie antworten wir auf rechtliche Anfragen, verhindern Schäden und fördern die Sicherheit und Integrität?
. Unter
Informationen für Strafverfolgungsbehörden
geben wir Informationen zu den operativen Richtlinien, die die Strafverfolgungsbehörden befolgen müssen.
Beispiele für irische Gesetze und in Irland durchsetzbare EU-Gesetze, durch die eine Verpflichtung entstehen könnte, sodass wir zur Verarbeitung der Informationen, die wir über dich gespeichert haben, verpflichtet sind:
Zivil- und Handelssachen: wenn wir eine gerichtliche Entscheidung erhalten oder anderweitig verpflichtet sind, Informationen für die Zwecke von Gerichtsverfahren offenzulegen, z. B. im Rahmen der Verordnung (EU) Nr. 1215/2012 über die gerichtliche Zuständigkeit und die Anerkennung und Vollstreckung von Entscheidungen in Zivil- und Handelssachen.
Strafsachen: zur Erfüllung von Anfragen von irischen Strafverfolgungsbehörden zur Bereitstellung von Informationen im Zusammenhang mit einer Ermittlung, z. B. im Rahmen von Section 10 des Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 wie durch 6(1)(a) des Criminal Justice Act 2006 geändert, oder zur Ergreifung von Maßnahmen, um Strafverfolgungsbehörden Informationen zu melden, sofern erforderlich.
Verbraucherangelegenheiten: zur Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen im Rahmen von Verbrauchergesetzen wie dem Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.
Unternehmens- und Steuerangelegenheiten: zur Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen wie dem Companies Act 2014.
Aufsichtsrechtliche Angelegenheiten: zur Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen zur Interaktion mit Aufsichtsbehörden, z. B. dem Data Protection Commission, im Rahmen der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung und des Data Protection Act 2018.
Finanzangelegenheiten: zur Erfüllung unserer Verpflichtungen im Rahmen geltender Gesetze für Finanzdienstleistungen wie der European Union (Payment Services) Regulations 2018
Sieh die
aktuelle Liste der Gesetze
an, die in Irland durchsetzbar sind und durch die eine rechtliche Verpflichtung für Meta entsteht, welche zur Verarbeitung von Informationen führt. Durch neue Gesetze, die erlassen werden, oder andere Verpflichtungen, die für unsere Verarbeitung deiner Informationen verbindlich werden, sind wir unter Umständen zur Verarbeitung deiner Informationen verpflichtet, und wir werden diese Liste von Zeit zu Zeit aktualisieren.
Die Informationskategorien hängen von den jeweiligen Umständen jeder verpflichtenden Anfrage oder Verpflichtung ab. Es werden nur die Informationen verarbeitet, die zur Erfüllung der entsprechenden rechtlichen Verpflichtungen erforderlich sind. Zum Beispiel: Bei Zivilsachen sind dies in der Regel eingeschränkte Informationen (wie Kontaktdaten und Login-Informationen). Je nach den Umständen können jedoch auch folgende Kategorien dazugehören:

Dropbox Terms of Service
Posted: January 7, 2025
Effective: January 7, 2025
You can see your previous Terms
here
.
Thanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working, and help you and those you work with stay coordinated. We do so by providing an intuitive, unified platform and suite of apps and services that keep your content safe, accessible and in sync. These terms of service (“
Terms
”) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites ("
Services
"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (“
North America
”) your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company. If you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc. Our
Privacy Policy
explains how we collect and use your information while our
Acceptable Use Policy
outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. If you are a member of a paid multi-user team (or a trial of a paid multi-user team) where an admin has control of your account ("Dropbox Team"), your team will also be bound to the
Dropbox Services Agreement
or another agreement between Dropbox and your team, and you will continue to remain subject to these Terms. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our
Privacy Policy
, and
Acceptable Use Policy
.
Your Stuff & Your Permissions
When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, connected services, and so on (“
Your Stuff
”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
You may need to register for an account to access the Services, and we may create an account for you so that you can interact with the Services.
Our Services include a suite of apps and websites. To help you stay productive, when you use the same account to access different parts of the suite, Your Stuff may come with you.
We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, Dropbox accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
Your Responsibilities
Your use of our Services must comply with our
Acceptable Use Policy
. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.
Dropbox may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our
Acceptable Use Policy
. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.
You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 if you reside in the United States, and 16 if you reside anywhere else. If the law where you reside requires that you must be older in order for Dropbox to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including use of your personal data), then you must be that older age.
Software
Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“
Software
”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.
Beta Services
We sometimes release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating (“
Beta Services
”). Beta Services are labeled “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox’s other services. Beta Services are made available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.
Beta Services are confidential until official launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.
Electronic Signatures
By using a part of the Services that facilitates electronic signatures, you agree to do business electronically and to use electronic records and signatures. There may be laws where you reside governing what types of documents and transactions are appropriate for such signatures. It’s your responsibility to ensure that the electronic signature functionality provided by the Services is appropriate for your scenario.
Templates and Forms
The Services may include sample templates and forms (“Templates”). Templates are for informational purposes only. We are not attorneys or a law firm, and our Templates are not a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney. You acknowledge that Dropbox is not providing you with legal advice or acting as your attorney or agent, and you assume full responsibility for any outcomes or costs associated with your use of our Templates.
Dropbox does not claim that documents based on the Templates are complete and suitable for use in all situations and jurisdictions. You should consult with an attorney about your specific situation before relying on the Templates for any contract, agreement or transaction. You hereby acknowledge that Dropbox is not a party to any agreement that you enter into as a result of the use of any document that you create or use through the Services. Use of the Services and any document (including any document based on the Templates) does not constitute an attorney-client relationship, joint venture or partnership between Dropbox and any user or third party. Communications between you and Dropbox are governed by these Terms and our
Privacy Policy
but are not protected by the attorney-client privilege or as work product.
We hope you’re satisfied with the Templates. If you have any concerns, please click
here
for more information and instructions on how to contact us.
The disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability below do not apply to consumers in North Carolina when using the Templates.
Fax Services
If you use a part of the Services that facilitates faxing, you may be required to provide information such as your name, billing address, physical address, payment information (including credit card number), and national ID number (where applicable). Failure to provide this information could result in suspension of your access.
You may not use our Services to send unsolicited fax advertisements or spam, and we may decide to not deliver any messages we consider unsolicited fax advertisements or spam.
We cannot guarantee that any particular fax number will be available for you to use. If you stop using our fax services, your number may be released or reassigned to another customer. In the US, UK, and Canada, we may support porting a fax number (both in and out) for an additional fee.
Additional Features
From time to time, Dropbox will add additional features to enhance the user experience of our storage service at no additional charge. However, these free features may be withdrawn without further notice.
Third-Party Features
The Services may give you the option to link to third-party features and integrations. Dropbox does not own or operate any such features or integrations. If you access or use any third-party features or integrations, you are responsible for this access and use, and Dropbox is not responsible for any act or omission of the third party or the availability, accuracy, the related content, products or services of third parties.
Our Stuff
The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
Copyright
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our
Copyright Policy
. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Copyright infringement claims should be submitted using our
Copyright Complaint Form
or submitted to our designated agent for our Services at:
Copyright Agent
Dropbox, Inc.
1800 Owens St
San Francisco, CA 94158
copyright@dropbox.com
Paid Accounts
Billing.
You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a “Paid Account”). We’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.
Cancellation.
You may cancel your
Paid Account
at any time. Refunds are only issued if
required by law
. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions and obtain a refund within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account by clicking
here
.
Downgrades.
Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you’re on a Dropbox Family plan, the Family manager may be able to downgrade your account at any time. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.
Changes.
We may change the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our product offerings, changes to our business, or changes in economic conditions. We’ll give you no less than 30 days’ advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect.
Dropbox Teams
Email address.
If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Team or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.
Using Dropbox Teams.
If you join a Dropbox Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox Team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox Team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Team.
Termination
You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if Dropbox reasonably believes:
you’re in breach of these Terms,
your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or
you don’t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.
We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
We won’t provide notice or an opportunity to export Your Stuff before termination or suspension of access to the Services where Dropbox reasonably believes:
you’re in material breach of these Terms, which includes, but is not limited to, violating our
Acceptable Use Policy
,
doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or
we're prohibited from doing so by law.
Once we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, you will not be able to access or export Your Stuff. Dropbox does not provide refunds if we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, unless required by law.
Discontinuation of Services
We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to exceptional unforeseen circumstances, events beyond Dropbox’s control (for example a natural disaster, fire, or explosion), or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems (we will give you no less than 30 days’ notice where possible under the circumstances). If we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.
Services “AS IS”
We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. For example, these disclaimers do not override the legal protections, including statutory warranties, granted to consumers by EU law.
Limitation of Liability
WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE AN EU OR UK CONSUMER, THESE TERMS DO NOT EXCLUDE DROPBOX’S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES OR OF OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU, AS LONG AS THOSE LOSSES AND DAMAGES ARE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR:
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.
OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW
.
Resolving Disputes
Let’s Try to Sort Things Out First.
We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written Notice of Dispute at dispute-notice@dropbox.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days after submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here:
https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr
.
Judicial Forum for Disputes.
You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements. The venue and exclusive jurisdiction provision above does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates.
IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
We Both Agree to Arbitrate.
You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the Services through final and binding individual arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under the “Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its scope, enforceability, revocability, or validity. The arbitrator may award relief only individually and only to the extent necessary to redress your individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the general public.
Opt out of Agreement to Arbitrate.
You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by
clicking here
and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account or agreeing to these Terms. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
Arbitration Procedures.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA’s rules and filing instructions are available at
www.adr.org
or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. For North Carolina consumers, for claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates, the arbitration will be held in North Carolina or any other location we agree to.
Arbitration Fees and Incentives.
The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. For individual arbitration of non-frivolous claims less than $75,000 for which you timely provided Dropbox with a Notice of Dispute, Dropbox will reimburse arbitration filing fees at the conclusion of the arbitration and will pay other arbitration fees. For all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim. This exclusive jurisdiction provision does not apply to North Carolina consumers with respect to claims relating to or arising out of use of the Templates.
NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS
. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.
Severability
. If any part of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public injunctive relief, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.
Controlling Law
These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.
Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a dispute with you. Otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties.
Waiver, Severability & Assignment
Dropbox’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
Modifications
We may revise these Terms to better reflect:
changes to the law,
new regulatory requirements, or
improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account and stop using the Services before the updated Terms become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
