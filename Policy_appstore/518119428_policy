REALNETWORKS LLC AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES
Last modified:  November 29, 2024
RealNetworks is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how RealNetworks collects and uses personal information when you use RealNetworks products, services and websites.
This Privacy Policy covers RealNetworks LLC, its majority-owned affiliates and worldwide subsidiaries, and RealNetworks divisions operating under different trade names (collectively "RealNetworks").   It applies to our products, services, and websites that display or reference this Policy, but it does not apply to any products that display or reference a different privacy policy. For example, to view the SAFR® Privacy Policy, please click

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
RealNetworks collects information as necessary to operate effectively, provide and improve the products and services we offer, communicate with you, and provide effective customer support.  Such information can include:
Your name and contact details such as email address, mailing address, and phone number;
Billing information, such as credit card number, when you make a purchase;
Demographic information such as your gender or language preference;
Information about your interaction with our websites such as pages visited, time and date, and subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits;
Information relating to your use of our products and services, for example geolocation information and the content you download using RealPlayer® (including domains associated with such content) or the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use including hashtags; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities for statistical purposes and improving the products and services;
Information relating to photographs or videos you upload through your device’s camera, or add to RealPlayer, MixMe™, or RealTimes®, which may include facial or object recognition information or patterns associated with photographs or videos to enable and improve image and facial recognition features and also to generate the outputs based on the analysis of those photos and videos;
information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created;
Information about your computer or mobile device such as your unique device ID (persistent/ non-persistent, MAC or IMEI), hardware, software, platform, browser type, and Internet Protocol (IP) address.
While most of this data come directly from you or your device, such as information you provide when you sign up for the service or information we gather when you use our products and services, we sometimes receive information from third parties such as partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities:
Advertisers that share information about your experiences or interactions with their offerings;
Service providers that help us determine your device’s location based on its IP address to customize certain products to your location;
Social networks (like Facebook and X) and similar third-party services, that make users’ information available to others;
Third-party account sign-in services like Google Account, and;
Publicly available sources.
For example, when you use a RealNetworks product or game through a Social Networking Site (“SNS”) such as Facebook, you allow RealNetworks to access certain information you provided to such SNS such as your user ID, first and last name, profile picture, and usage data for that product or service. By accessing a RealNetworks’ product or service through an SNS, you are authorizing RealNetworks to collect, store and use information that you agreed the SNS could provide to RealNetworks through the SNS. RealNetworks' collection, storage and use of your information are governed by this Privacy Policy. RealNetworks may access videos, photographs, and other media you share on an SNS with the public and use such material in accordance with the terms and policies of that SNS.  If you do not want RealNetworks to have such access, adjust your SNS privacy settings so that the media is not shared with the public.
As an example of publicly available sources, RealNetworks collects publicly available images of known celebrities and public figures. RealNetworks uses these images to develop associated facial recognition data for its celebrity database, which supports the celebrity recognition feature in RealPlayer and StarSearch® by Real Chrome Extension.
We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide a service, you may not be able to use that service. We do not use personal information received from third-party account sign-in services for any reason other than providing or improving the application’s or website’s functionality, and RealNetworks does not sell data obtained from third-party account sign-in services.
Our services are not targeted to children and RealNetworks does not intentionally or knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
RealNetworks uses the personal information we collect to enable our operations and to provide our products and services, including:
Deliver to you and bill you for RealNetworks products and services;
Verify access rights to premium content or other access-restricted services and software;
Determine if your device meets minimum system requirements to use our products, and provide information concerning compatibility and interoperability;

Track content use for the purpose of paying royalties and license fees to third-party providers or statistical purposes; and

Additionally, when you comment on someone else’s post or react to their content, your interaction becomes visible to anyone who can see that content, and the owner of the post has the ability to alter the audience at any time. Others can also use our products to create and share content about you with their chosen audience.

If you are concerned about how you are represented in any content shared on our products, you can contact us with a consumer request for deletion using any of the means listed at the end of this policy.

TRANSFER OF DATA TO OTHER COUNTRIES
RealNetworks processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. We may also subcontract processing or share your information to third parties located in countries other than your home country. Information collected by RealNetworks in the United States may, for example, be transferred to and processed in a country outside of the United States. Information collected within the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed in a country outside of the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. RealNetworks generally transfers such data under the standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission.  Wherever we process personal information, we do so according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the requirements of the applicable law.
EU-U.S., UK EXTENSION, AND SWISS-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK PROGRAM
RealNetworks also participates in the EU-U.S., UK Extension and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Program (collectively “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. RealNetworks certifies it adheres to the DPF Principles.  If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF shall govern.
In absence of an adequacy decision, RealNetworks provides appropriate safeguards for the transfers personal data to a third country or an international organization such as, but not limited to, standard contractual clause, and binding corporate rules. In absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards, RealNetworks will only make an international transfer of personal data if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between you, as the data subject, and the controller, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request.
In some cases, RealNetworks may remain liable if a third party processes personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles. To learn more about the DPF, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list
.
If you have a question or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, we encourage you to contact us via our
web form
. For any complaints related to the DPF that cannot be resolved with RealNetworks directly, you may seek resolution of your complaint by contacting the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution
, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (ICDR-AAA). As further explained in the DPF Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. RealNetworks is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have certain rights with respect to that information.
Right to know
Those rights include a “right to know” which allows you to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect and details about how we collect, use, and disclose that information. Note that much of that information is provided in this Privacy Policy, including in the below table which provides you a summary of our data collection, use and sharing practices by data category for the preceding 12 months.  Please note that this information supplements the information provided in the sections above.
Right to delete
California residents also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to several exceptions.
Right to opt-out from sale
California residents have the right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” and “personal information” very broadly such that making personal information available to third-party advertising companies can be considered a “sale” in some circumstances. While we made such information regarding California residents available to advertising companies in the preceding 12 months, as described in the “when and how do we share personal information with third parties?” section of this Policy, we do not currently do so and thus do not currently “sell” information related to California residents.
To exercise the right to know or the right to request deletion, please refer to the “how to access, update and delete your personal information” section.  California residents also have the right to not be discriminated against if they choose to exercise any of the above rights.

RealNetworks use third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics to help us compile aggregated statistics about the operation and effectiveness of our websites. Analytics providers set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your use of our websites and those of other companies.  You can learn more about Google Analytics, including how to opt-out, by visiting Google’s Privacy & Terms for Partners.
Advertising Companies:
We work with third-party advertising companies to help ensure the advertisements about goods and services you see are likely to be of greater interest to you. These third-party partners currently include Google’s DoubleClick. The advertising companies we work with typically use third-party cookies and/or web beacons to collect a unique ID number in combination with information such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to this and other websites. In order to enable a consistent browsing experience, the RealPlayer PC application may copy the DoubleClick cookie from your web browser to the app’s embedded browser. Please review our use of Cookies section to understand how we Use cookies and how you can change cookie settings. Learn more about Google DoubleClick here:

These advertising IDs can be controlled or reset through your mobile operating system settings. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.
When you search for specific content on RealNetworks websites, the search terms may be embedded in the "search string" that appears in the URL display window of your web browser. Certain advertising services or third-party content providers may associate these search strings with cookies they set or retrieve from our pages.

The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the third party to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. Additionally, RealNetworks may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties.

TRANSFER OF DATA TO OTHER COUNTRIES
RealNetworks processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. We may also subcontract processing or share your information to third parties located in countries other than your home country. Information collected by RealNetworks in the United States may, for example, be transferred to and processed in a country outside of the United States. Information collected within the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to, and processed in a country outside of the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. RealNetworks generally transfers such data under the standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission.  Wherever we process personal information, we do so according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the requirements of the applicable law.
EU-U.S., UK EXTENSION, AND SWISS-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK PROGRAM
RealNetworks also participates in the EU-U.S., UK Extension and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Program (collectively “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. RealNetworks certifies it adheres to the DPF Principles.  If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF shall govern.
In absence of an adequacy decision, RealNetworks provides appropriate safeguards for the transfers personal data to a third country or an international organization such as, but not limited to, standard contractual clause, and binding corporate rules. In absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards, RealNetworks will only make an international transfer of personal data if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between you, as the data subject, and the controller, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request.
In some cases, RealNetworks may remain liable if a third party processes personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles. To learn more about the DPF, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list
.
If you have a question or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, we encourage you to contact us via our
web form
. For any complaints related to the DPF that cannot be resolved with RealNetworks directly, you may seek resolution of your complaint by contacting the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution
, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (ICDR-AAA). As further explained in the DPF Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. RealNetworks is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have certain rights with respect to that information.
Right to know
Those rights include a “right to know” which allows you to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect and details about how we collect, use, and disclose that information. Note that much of that information is provided in this Privacy Policy, including in the below table which provides you a summary of our data collection, use and sharing practices by data category for the preceding 12 months.  Please note that this information supplements the information provided in the sections above.
Right to delete
California residents also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to several exceptions.
Right to opt-out from sale
California residents have the right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” and “personal information” very broadly such that making personal information available to third-party advertising companies can be considered a “sale” in some circumstances. While we made such information regarding California residents available to advertising companies in the preceding 12 months, as described in the “when and how do we share personal information with third parties?” section of this Policy, we do not currently do so and thus do not currently “sell” information related to California residents.
To exercise the right to know or the right to request deletion, please refer to the “how to access, update and delete your personal information” section.  California residents also have the right to not be discriminated against if they choose to exercise any of the above rights.
