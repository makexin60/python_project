Type Loop 1.1 is at the doorstep
Dear Type Loop community,
we are happy to announce that the development of our new app version is almost complete! The upcoming version 1.1 of Type Loop will not only maintain the features you already appreciate, but will also introduce a number of exciting new features. So far, Type Loop has helped you enhance your social media content by adding animated text to photos and videos. With version 1.1, we're taking it a step further.
The new version will streamline the user experience with an improved user interface that makes it easier to choose the animations you want. We've taken your feedback seriously and are working on making the naming of the different animations more intuitive, replacing the previous labels. In addition, Type Loop 1.1 will feature a whole new selection of animations to expand your creative options.
We're excited about the upcoming improvements and can't wait to bring you more details. In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more information about the new version and the exciting new features.
