                       Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer,

                        and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
Performance/Analytical Cookies.
Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand 
                        how visitors use our Services. They do this by collecting information about the number of

                        of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content 
                        for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google Inc. (“Google”) uses cookies in 
                        connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information 
                        collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics

                        Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.
Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your 
                        online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is 
                        relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information 
                        about Interest-Based Advertisements.”
You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through your internet browser’s settings. Most 
                          browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from 
                          accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow 
                          you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies 
                          that are already on your device. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some 
                          preferences every time you visit our website and some of the Services and functionalities may not work.

                          your browser’s menu. To find out more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage

Data Security and Retention
We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, 
                      organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. 
                      You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; 
                      limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 
                      Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that 
                      no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

                      retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not retain any End User Data for more than twenty-four months, unless otherwise directed 
                      by the Developer to whom the End User Data relates.  We may retain End User Data longer than twenty-four months if required by law, 
                      regulatory authority, tax purposes or allowed by law or if End User Data is relevant to serving legitimate business services.

                      learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 
                      If you believe that your child under 16 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at privacy@bytebrew.io.

                      contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that 
                      is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the 
                      following rights apply to you, please contact us at privacy@bytebrew.io.
Access
You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will 
                      provide you with the following information:
The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal 
                      Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of 
                      Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.
Deletion
You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: 
                      for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your 
                      deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow 
                      us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, 
                      evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet 
                      these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit 
                      a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is 
                      excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision 
                      before completing your request.
Contact CCPA Methods:
You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
Email us at:
privacy@bytebrew.io
You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written 
                      permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on 
                      your behalf.
Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In
We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide 
                      you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data 
                      privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.
