personalize the Apps and our communications, including remembering the devices from which you have previously logged in and remembering your selections and preferences as you navigate the Apps as well as understand your needs and interests;
establish and maintain your user profile on the Apps such as by conducting eligibility checks;
facilitate your invitations to contacts who you want to invite to join the Apps;
enable security features of the Apps, such as by sending you security codes via email or SMS, and remembering devices from which you have previously logged in;

provide support for the Apps, and respond to your requests, questions, and feedback.
Apps improvement, analytics and development.
We may use your personal information for Apps improvement, analytics and development purposes, including to analyze and improve the Apps and our business and to develop new products and services. As part of these activities, we use aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data derived from your personal information.
Data aggregation, de-identification and/or anonymization.
As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data from personal information we collect. We make personal information into de-identified or anonymized data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Apps and promote our business and will not attempt to reidentify any such data.
Research.
As a science-based company, we may use aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data derived from your personal information to conduct scientific research and analysis on our own or with other relevant parties. We may publish research-related findings.
Marketing and advertising.
We, our service providers and our third-party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:
Direct marketing.
We may send you direct marketing communications (including educational materials) and may personalize these messages based on your needs and interests. You may opt-out of our marketing communications as described in the
Opt-out of marketing
section below.
Interest-based advertising.
Our third-party advertising partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction (including the data described in the automatic data collection section above) with the Apps, our communications and other online services over time, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. This is called interest-based advertising. We may also share information about our users with these companies to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the Manage Cookie Preferences section of our
Cookie Policy.
Compliance and protection.
We may use your personal information to:
comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas, investigations or requests from government authorities;
protect our, your or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims);
audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements or our internal policies;
enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Apps; and
prevent, identify, investigate and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft.
With your consent.
In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to collect, use or share your personal information, such as when required by law.
How we share your personal information
We may share your personal information with the following parties and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, in other applicable notices, or at the time of collection.
Affiliates.
Our corporate parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates.
Service providers.
Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Apps or our business (such as hosting, information technology, customer support, language translators, email/text/push notification delivery, marketing, consumer research, and website analytics).
Payment processors.
Any payment card information you use to make a purchase on the Apps is collected and processed directly by our payment processors, such as Braintree through PayPal. PayPal (and its corporate affiliates) may use your payment data in accordance with their respective privacy policies such as those available at
Braintree Payments
and
PayPal.
Advertising partners.
Third-party advertising companies for the interest-based advertising purposes described above.
Third parties designated by you.
We may share your personal information with third parties where you have instructed us or provided your consent to do so.
Eligibility Checks.
If you ask us to check if you are eligible for no-cost access to our Apps from organizations that provide such access, we will disclose your personal information to those organizations in an effort to determine your eligibility for such services.
Organizations that provide you with our Apps.
If an organization provides you with access to our Apps, we may share your personal information with that organization. The manner in which and the nature of which we share your personal information depends upon the type of organization that has provided you with our Apps and the relevant agreement that we may have with that organization. At a high level, we explain here how and in what manner we may share your personal information with these organizations.
Supervising Groups.
We work with certain organizations that provide you with access to our Apps and also directly supervise your use of our Apps (for purposes of this Policy, we refer to them as “Supervising Groups”), such as hospitals, sports teams, retirement communities, and scientific organizations. If your access to our Apps is provided by a Supervising Group, then we may share all of your personal information with that Supervising Group so that they can offer their services to you.
Non-supervising Groups.
We work with certain organizations that provide you with access to our Apps but do not directly supervise your use of our Apps (for purposes of this Policy, we refer to them as “Non-supervising Groups”), such as insurance companies and libraries and cell phone providers. If your access to our Apps is provided by a Non-supervising Group, then we may share specific personal information (depending on our agreement with the Non-supervising Group) about you with that Non-supervising Group. For example, we may provide information about the frequency with which you use our Apps (for example, the number of times you used our Apps in a month, or that you did not use our Apps in that month) to a Non-supervising Group organization, so that the relevant organization can, for example, evaluate the usage of our Apps by its constituents and conduct analyses that relate the usage of our Apps for their own records (for example, to determine if people who frequently use our Apps also incur fewer insurance claims). As another example, if your Non-supervising Group organization provides you with an incentive (such as an insurance discount) for completing specific goals within our Apps, for example completing a specific number of exercises or assessments, then we will share with that Non-supervising Group organization the specific information required for them to offer the incentive to you (such as the date on which you completed the goal).
When we disclose personal information about you to an organization that provides you with access to our Apps, the relevant privacy policy of that organization may apply to that organization’s use, disclosure and other processing of that personal information. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these organizations, you should read and understand the applicable privacy policy. You can contact us at support@brainhq.com and ask us if your access to our Apps is being provided by an organization, and if so, how to contact that organization. If you do not want your personal information to be shared with an organization that provides you with access to our Apps, you can contact us and ask us to remove you from that organization. We will do so, which will prevent the sharing of your personal information with that organization after the date you are removed from the organization, and will remove the access you have to our Apps provided by the organization.
Business partners.
Our business partners and collaborators (including any third-party collaborators working with us on our scientific research).
Log-in third-party services.
If you log into the Apps with, or otherwise link your Apps account to, a social media or other third-party service, we may share your personal information with that third-party service. The third party’s use of the shared information will be governed by its privacy policy and the settings associated with your account with the third-party service.
Professional advisors.
Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
Authorities and others.
Law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate for the Compliance and protection purposes described above.
Business transferees.
We may disclose personal information in the context of actual or prospective business transactions (e.g., investments in or financing of Posit Science, or the sale, transfer or merger of all or part of our business, assets or shares). We will take commercially reasonably measures in an effort to protect your personal information in connection with the purposes of the actual or prospective business transaction with Posit Science. In the event of a merger or acquisition transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, or divestiture of all or a portion of our business or assets, we may share your personal information for the purpose of allowing your continued use of the Apps as managed by the merged or acquiring company. We may also disclose your personal information to an acquirer, successor, or assignee of Posit Science as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, and/or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.
Other users and the public.
If you choose to use certain social features of our Apps, certain personal data will be shared with other users. When you choose to use a social feature, the App will show you data that will be shared with other users (for example, your profile picture or your use of a specific exercise), and who those users are (for example, a single person of your choice, or a group of people). This information can be seen, collected and used by others, including being cached, copied, screen captured or stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines), and we are not responsible for any such use of this information.

We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity, and confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

Does this Privacy Policy apply to my use of the Apps?
Depending on whether Posit Science or another entity provisions your access to the Apps, this Privacy Policy may or may not apply to you.
We work with certain health care providers where, by contractual agreement with Posit Science, that organization owns and manages the data of its constituents in BrainHQ (a “Controlling Group”). If your access to our Apps is provided by such a Controlling Group, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information that we process on behalf of the Controlling Group that provides you with such access. Instead, our use of such personal information is governed by the relevant agreement between that Controlling Group and Posit Science. You can contact us at support@brainhq.com and ask us if your access to our Apps is being provided by a Controlling Group, and if so, how to contact that Controlling Group. If you have questions regarding your personal information that we process on behalf of such a Controlling Group, please direct your questions to that Controlling Group. The respective Controlling Group is responsible for providing you with an appropriate privacy notice that describes how we may use your personal information in connection with your use of our Apps.
If you use Posit Science Apps directly from us or through any other organization (in other words, a Non-supervising Group that does not own the data of its constituents in relation to use of our Apps), this Privacy Policy applies to your personal information.
