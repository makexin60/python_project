It is important to point out that we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please just visit this page if you want to stay up to date, as we will post any changes here.
If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of our Privacy Policy, you may have legal rights and, where relevant, we have described these in this document.
How to Use This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy tells you a few things about how we use your personal data, and perhaps more importantly, what your rights are in relation to this (you have, for example, the right to ask us to delete or confirm the nature of information that we hold about you at any time, withdraw any consents that you may previously have given and/or lodge a complaint with our Data Protection Officer or a supervisory authority if you are not happy about something we have done).
The Privacy Policy is broadly divided into two sections:
Context-specific privacy information that applies to the different categories of person covered by this Privacy Policy, as follows:
Candidates
Temporary Workers
Clients
Suppliers and Third Parties
People Whose Data We Receive

General privacy information that applies to all of the different categories of people covered by this Privacy Policy, including:
Who do we share your personal data with?
How do we safeguard your personal data?
How long do we keep your personal data for?
How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us?

Cookies Policy
Use of third party services
This Privacy Policy applies in relevant countries throughout our international network. Different countries may approach data privacy in slightly different ways and so we also have country-specific parts to this Privacy Policy. You can
find
country-specific provisions for your jurisdiction
here
. This allows us to ensure that we're
complying with all applicable data privacy protections, no matter where you are.
This Privacy Policy also contains a number of defined terms (which we distinguish by starting them with a capital letter), so we have included a
Glossary
at the end of this document.
Context-Specific Privacy Information
Candidates
This section of the Privacy Policy applies to Candidates.
Candidates include individuals with whom Hays has not had prior contact, but whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in, or might benefit from, Hays’ services and being considered for any roles advertised or promoted by Hays including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' Clients (including those individuals who want to become Temporary Workers). Candidates also include applicants for such roles as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job and/or who have engaged with Hays about Hays’ services and/or any roles advertised or promoted by Hays. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays' Clients as part of an MSP offering or otherwise will be treated as Candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

.
Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where we have obtained your contact details from an occasion when you previously engaged with us (for example by informing one of our consultants that you are interested in our services, submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are e-marketing or sending by text message other recruitment-related services of our own. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you object or opt out (and we will remind you of your right to do this and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out, in each e-marketing message that we send to you). For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to provide you with information that we think will be of interest to you and suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. We will use your personal data to send you e-marketing materials with your ‘soft opt-in’ consent if we deem that it is in our legitimate interests to do so.
For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.

We want to let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing communications through our preference centre, it is possible that your details may be recaptured through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try to make sure this doesn't happen, but if it does, we're sorry. We'd just ask that in those circumstances you opt out again.

Why and how we process your information
Types of personal data used
Legal basis relied upon
Preserving, sharing and otherwise processing Candidate data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
The actual information used depends on the factual circumstances, but could include any of the following:
Key identification and contact information
Education and employment information
Special category information
Criminal conviction data
Financial information
Automatically collected information
Information that others provide about you
Additional information that you choose to tell us
Legitimate interests, namely it is in our interests to seek and receive legal advice should we need it and to protect ourselves in the context of litigation and other disputes
In the unlikely event that we need to process any special category information or criminal conviction data for this purpose, we will only do so where local law allows us to process such data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making
Profiling is a type of processing activity which enables us better to understand the information that we collect about you, to help us to develop a personalised “profile” for you. This helps us to gain a better idea of how you like to interact with us and our services, the sorts of requests you like to make of us and, of course, the sorts of things you don’t like.  The purpose of our building this personalised profile is to enable us to provide the best possible service to you and maximise the chances that we will be able quickly and efficiently to provide you with access to content that is most likely to be relevant and helpful to you.
We will use profiling methods in relation to your personal data if we consider this is necessary for our legitimate interests as detailed in the table below. If you are not happy about this, in certain circumstances you have the right to object and can find out more about how and when to do this by referring to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy.
We also sometimes use automated systems such as filtering tools, or occasionally more complex tools which use an element of artificial intelligence, such as algorithms or machine learning (including those provided by third parties), to help us quickly, efficiently and more accurately to analyse data we have about you and other Candidates, as well as data we hold on our Clients' needs, and this ultimately helps us to make decisions based on this data. This can include applying tools which use algorithms (such as filtering tools or machine learning) to Candidate personal data in order to help us come up with the best possible shortlist for a particular role. Such technology should reduce significantly the amount of time needed to consider when Candidates might be the best fit for relevant jobs. This should in turn make the recruitment process much more efficient and effective, which, we hope, will improve your overall experience with us.
As new and better technology becomes more prevalent, some of our profiling activities and our processing activities which use automated systems such as those described above, may amount to Automated Decision Making within the meaning of Article 22 of the GDPR. This means a process of making a decision by automated means with limited, or even no, human intervention in reaching the decision. We will only use automated decision making in relation to your personal data where we consider this is necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.

help us to optimise the matching of Candidate profiles to roles and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the recruitment cycle
allow us to keep track of whether we have enough suitable Candidates to fulfil our business needs and those of our Clients at all times
help our consultants to make decisions in relation to suggesting relevant roles and sending relevant communications to you
We may use profiling methods in relation to Candidates' data so that we can:
place them and other suitable
Candidates
on shortlists for particular roles based on prescribed criteria, which will allow our consultants to identify the most appropriate Candidates for roles in the most efficient manner efficiently; and
recommend roles based on how a Candidate's interests, habits, attributes and/or preferences, rank in comparison to other Candidates
Our intention is for any such activities (which might involve using automated processes to profile, select, screen, rank, grade, shortlist and/or put forward Candidates for roles) to complement rather than completely replace the activity of our consultants

help our consultants to make decisions in relation to suggesting relevant roles to you
If these shortlisting and ranking activities amount to Automated Decision Making for the purposes of Article 22 of the GDPR, we will only conduct these activities where we deem this to be necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.  We think it is reasonable to assume that, as a Candidate, you are hoping to enter into an employment contract, and that by using our services you are asking us to take the necessary steps for this purpose. Such steps might include, for example, checking you meet certain requirements for a particular role. If the role is very popular, we may have to check the eligibility of a large number of potential Candidates – we may therefore use automated decision making to filter this pool of Candidates down to a more manageable number.
Compliance with a legal obligation
In some circumstances, we will use your personal data to comply with our legal obligations. Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which (we) are subject”.

If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we will, depending on the relevant circumstances and applicable local laws and requirements, collect some or all of the information listed below (in addition to the data collected about Candidates) in order to ensure that our Temp Relationship runs smoothly and that we are able to comply with our contractual and other duties to each other, and to our Clients, as part of our Temp Relationship and our duties to third parties such as tax authorities and government agencies. In some jurisdictions, we are restricted from processing some of the data outlined below. In such cases, we will only process the data in those jurisdictions to the extent and under the circumstances permitted by law:
Temporary worker information

A number of elements of the items listed above are required to enable us to fulfil our contractual duties to you or to others. Some, for example your social security number (or equivalent) are required by statute or other laws. Other items may simply be needed to ensure that our Temp Relationship can run smoothly, or to run our business.
Depending on the type of personal data in question and the grounds on which we may be processing it, should you decline to provide us with such data, we may not be able to fulfil our contractual requirements or, in extreme cases, may not be able to continue with our Temp Relationship.
How do we collect your personal data?
If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we collect your data (in addition to the data already collected about Candidates) in the following ways:
Personal data that you give to us; and
Personal data that we receive from other sources.
Below are some more details about each of these methods.
Personal data you give to us
Hays needs to know certain information about you in order to fulfil our obligations to you, to ensure that you are properly fulfilling your obligations to us, and to ensure that we are both fulfilling our obligations to others. This information will enable us to operate a usual Temp Relationship, along with all that entails.
There are numerous ways that you can share your information with us in addition to the information you share as a Candidate. Where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements, these may include:
when you complete registration forms at the beginning of our Temp Relationship; or
in meetings or communications with your consultant, our HR team or other colleagues.
The types of information that we receive from you in this way include:
Temporary worker information; and
Special category information,
as described in the section entitled “What Kind of Personal Information Do We Collect?” above.
Personal data we receive from other sources
We also receive personal data about you from other sources. Depending on the relevant circumstances and applicable local laws and requirements, these may include personal data received in the following situations:
if you were referred to us through a recruitment agency or other work agencies, they may have shared personal information about you with us;
information obtained about you from third party service providers who undertook background checks about you on our behalf at the start of our Temp Relationship;
your colleagues may share personal information about you with us;
medical professionals may (in appropriate and limited circumstances) share personal information about you with us;
your pension and benefits providers may share relevant personal information about you with us; and

as described in the section entitled “What Kind of Personal Information Do We Collect?” above.
HOw do we use your personal data?
If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we use your data for the following purposes:
To ensure the smooth running of our Temp Relationship, including all of the activities that need to be undertaken in a usual relationship of that type, such as:
facilitating payroll and invoicing processes, if relevant to your jurisdiction;
determining the terms on which you work during your Temp Relationship;
keeping a record of any promotions, salary rises or bonuses you are awarded; and
Assessing your performance.
Some more detailed information about the way in which your data is processed can be found in the
Recruits Privacy Policy
. For example, during the on-boarding process with Hays, Temporary Workers will be treated in a similar way as recruits for Hays roles and their personal data during the recruitment process for such roles will be processed in the ways described in the
Recruits Privacy Policy
. Depending on the applicable local laws, we appreciate that you are not a 'Recruit' in the sense of that Policy but given that we use the data in a similar way, for the same purposes, we thought you wouldn’t mind having a quick look at that policy if you were interested in a greater level of detail.

Temp Relationship Activities
We've listed below various ways in which we will use and process your personal data in connection with our Temp Relationship, where appropriate and in accordance with any local laws and requirements. Please note that this list is not exhaustive.
In most cases, we will use your personal data for the purposes below if it is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under a contract that we have entered into with you or if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests.
Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.”
Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it “is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of you which require protection of personal data.”
We don't think that any of the activities in relation to which we rely on the legitimate interests condition prejudice Temporary Workers in any way – in fact, they help us to offer you a more tailored, efficient service. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please refer to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy.
When we process your information for recruitment activities based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before the consent is withdrawn. You can find out more about how to do so by referring to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the
General Privacy Information
section of this Privacy Policy.

Temporary worker information
Special category information
If you have entered into a Temp Relationship with us, we will rely on the performance of a contract legal basis to the extent that the processing activity that we are seeking to conduct is necessary for the purposes of the contract that we have entered into with you
We will otherwise rely on legitimate interests, namely it is in our interests and your interests for us to facilitate the Temp Relationship
If we need to process your special category data (e.g. details of any sickness absence including health-related information), we will process your personal data in this way if we have a legitimate interest in and it is necessary for us to process your data for health and social care purposes and local laws allow us to process your data in this way without obtaining your consent. If local law requires us to obtain your consent, we will do so.
Sharing of data
If we employ or engage you directly as a Temporary Worker, we may share your personal data with a number of additional parties in order to ensure the smooth running of our Temp Relationship. For example, we may share your personal data with appropriate colleagues within Hays (this may include colleagues in overseas offices), with a Client and, if appropriate, medical professionals such as your GP or an occupational health specialist (for instance, for the purpose of any work adjustment assessments if applicable).
We will generally rely on the same legal bases referred to in the section addressing Temp Relationship Activities above depending on the context.

This helps us to gain a better idea of how you like to interact with us and our services, the sorts of requests you like to make of us and, of course, the sorts of things you don’t like.  The purpose of our building this personalised profile is to enable us to provide the best possible service to you and maximise the chances that we will be able quickly and efficiently to provide you with access to content that is most likely to be relevant and helpful to you.
We will use profiling methods in relation to your personal data if we consider this is necessary for our legitimate interests as detailed in the table below. If you are not happy about this, in certain circumstances you have the right to object and can find out more about how and when to do this by referring to the section entitled “How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us” in the

This means a process of making a decision by automated means with limited, or even no, human intervention in reaching the decision. We will only use automated decision making in relation to your personal data where we consider this is necessary for the completion of pre-contractual steps taken at your request.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information please let us know immediately. Details of how to contact us can be found
here
.
How long do we keep your personal data for?
In determining the appropriate retention period for different types of personal data, we always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data in question, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of that personal data, the purposes for which we need to process it and whether we can achieve those purposes by other means (in addition of course to ensuring that we comply with our legal, regulatory and risk-management obligations).
We set out below the retention practices that we apply to certain categories of people.
Candidates:
If you are a Candidate, we will keep your personal data on our Systems for a period of up to two years from the point that we collect such personal data or subsequently have meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with).After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.  We may keep your personal data on our Systems for a longer period than this if we believe in good faith that we need to do so, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
We will consider there to be meaningful contact with you in this context if you, for example, submit a CV to us via our website, take part in any of our online training, communicate with us about potential roles (either by verbal or written communication) or click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact for these purposes, only where you click-through or reply directly – we will only deem that we have had meaningful contact with you if there is positive action on your part.
For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, meaningful contact with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.
If you have expressly indicated as a Candidate that you would rather we didn't retain your personal data, then we will Delete it from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
Temporary Workers:
If we employ or engage you as a Temporary Worker directly, we will ordinarily process your data throughout the course of your Temp Relationship and will then retain it for a period after we have parted ways. The precise length of time will depend on the type of data, our legitimate business needs and other legal or regulatory rules that may require us to retain it for certain minimum periods. For example, we may be required to retain certain data for the purposes of tax reporting or responding to tax queries. We may also retain it if it might be relevant to any potential litigation. In jurisdictions that allow it, we will generally retain personal data relating to you where necessary to enable us to provide you or a future employer with a reference.
If you are a Temporary Worker, we will also continue to process your personal data as a Candidate through the duration of your Temp Relationship and thereafter. The question of whether and the extent to which we will continue to process your personal data as Staff data through the duration of your Temp Relationship and thereafter depends on local law requirements. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
Clients and Suppliers:
If you are a Client or a Supplier we will retain your personal data in order to provide you with services or to receive services from you, or to provide you with information about our services that we believe you may be interested in.
If you have expressly indicated that you're not interested in our services, then we will Delete your personal data from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
Website Users:
If you are a Website User we will retain your IP address and any other information that is required to operate the website or our mobile apps for 365 days.
Other Categories of people:
We will otherwise retain your data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purpose it was collected or processed for. If this time has come or you have expressly indicated that you’re not interested in one of our website or mobile app services anymore, we will Delete it from our Systems unless we believe in good faith that we need to preserve it, for example, because of our obligations to tax authorities or in connection with any anticipated litigation.
How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you HAVE given to us?
One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.
To get in touch about these rights, please
contact us
. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
Right to object:
this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our legitimate interests; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.
The “legitimate interests” and “direct marketing” categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates, Temporary Workers, Clients and Suppliers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:
we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or
we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.
If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.
Right to withdraw consent:
Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, in order to use cookies or pixels in certain jurisdictions), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.
Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):
You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or Delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is “manifestly unfounded or excessive”. If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.
Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
Right to erasure:
You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:
the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;
where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;
the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);
it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or
if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.
Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject right to erasure and may refuse your request in accordance with local laws.
For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click
here
.
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:
to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
for public health reasons in the public interest;
for archival, research or statistical purposes; or
to exercise or defend a legal claim.
When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will Delete the relevant data.
Right to restrict processing:
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either: (i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved; (ii) you consent; or (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest.
The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:
where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;
where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;
where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and
where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.
Right to rectification:
You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.
Right of data portability:
If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Hays account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we will directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Details of how to contact them can be found
here
.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), details of how to contact us can be found
here
. Please note that we will, where necessary, keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
You may ask to unsubscribe from job alerts and other marketing communications from us at any time. Details of how to do so can be found
here
.
It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.

How do we store and transfer data internationally?
So you want to know more about how we store and transfer your data internationally? In order to provide you with the best service and to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your data will be transferred:
between and within Hays entities;
to third parties (such as advisers or other Suppliers to the Hays business);
to overseas Clients where applicable;
to Clients within your country, where applicable, who may, in turn, transfer your data internationally;
to a cloud-based storage provider; and
to other third parties as set out in the section entitled “Who do we share your personal data with” above.
We want to make sure that your data are stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the European Economic Area or EEA (i.e. the Member States of the European Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, for example:
by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by data controllers in the EEA to data controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or
transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation; or
by way of scheme approved by the European Commission (whether as a successor to the Privacy Shield or otherwise) which regulates exchanges of person data between jurisdictions; or
where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract (for example, if we need to transfer data outside the EEA in order to meet our obligations under that contract if you are a Client of ours); or
where you have consented to the data transfer.
To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the third parties we share your personal data with to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the law on data protection.
Cookies Policy
What's a cookie?
A “cookie“ (or similar technology such as a tracking pixel) (“Cookie”) is a very small text file or graphic that is placed on your device when you visit a webpage or open an email and which records your behaviour (such as navigation of a website). Cookies are used to enhance your use of the various Hays digital channels, for example by enabling us to present tailored content and options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.
Cookies are used by nearly all digital channels and do not harm your system. We use them irrespective of whether you interact with Hays via our website, an app or other digital channel, and regardless of whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else.
If you want to check or change what types of Cookies you accept, this can usually be altered using the privacy settings within your browser, or you can do so very easily using the “Cookie Preferences” link at either the top or bottom of the website. Please note that if you access Hays' services across multiple devices, you may need to adjust your settings via the Cookie Preferences link on each of your devices.
How do we use Cookies?
We use Cookies to do the following:
to personalise your experience of our digital channels and to enhance their functionality, for example:
to keep you signed in to your account throughout your visit;
to tailor and increase the relevance of the content that you see (which may vary depending on whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else, and also according to your preferences) which we hope will in turn increase engagement with and improve the experience of using our services (and encourage you to return);
if you are a Candidate, to personalise marketing content that we make available to you via our digital channels (where you have consented to that marketing) which we hope will increase application numbers, conversion rates and application usefulness;
to understand how you engage with our website and other digital channels, for example by tracking the pages you have visited, the interactions you have made, the links you have followed, and the number of job ads and articles read. This enables us to understand how you use our digital channels, tailor what we show and send to you, and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve our digital channels and services in response to what our visitors want and need (and we understand that those wants and needs vary depending on whether you are a Candidate, Temporary Worker, Client, Supplier, Website User or someone else) which in turn helps us increase engagement with and improve the experience of using our services by increasing the relevance of the content that we serve. Also, as described above in the sections on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”, the process of analysing web-based behaviours enables us to award Candidates a weighted “approachability score” with a view to providing insights into Candidates' needs and allow Hays to follow up where needed, and Consultants use these scores as part of shortlisting and ranking Candidates and as a factor in determining whether to approach/show roles to a Candidate, which will serve to supplement other data that Hays holds about the Candidate; and
if you are a Candidate:
to help us advertise jobs to you that we think you'll be interested in, by personalising the roles that are brought to your attention;
to personalise our recommendations for editorial content (such as reports about developments in your industry) that we think may be of interest;
to enrich Candidate data and existing profiles about Candidates that we already hold on our Systems;
analysing data obtained by tracking and monitoring Candidates’ experience and account activity in order to profile Candidates and allocate them to “talent pools” based on their attributes and behaviours (e.g. previous roles, skills, industry experience, location, or when a Candidate is willing to work) – as described above in the sections on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”, the assignment of Candidates to talent pools is a fully automated process and can involve the use of bots.
Hopefully this means less time for you trawling through endless pages and will get you into the employment you want more quickly.
Cookies are either:
Session cookies: these are only stored on your device during your browser session and automatically expire when you close your browser – they allow the website to recognise and link your actions during a browsing session and usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page, but they do not collect any information from your device; or
Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored on your device in between browsing sessions and so it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see above for more information about what personalisation may involve and also the sections above on “Profiling, Algorithms and Automated Decision Making”).
Cookies can also be categorised as follows:
Strictly required cookies:
These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.
Functionality cookies:
These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular. Furthermore these cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.
Advertisement cookies:
These cookies help us to advertise details of potential job opportunities that we think may be of interest. These cookies are persistent (for as long as you are registered with us) and mean that when you log in or return to the website, you may see advertising for jobs that are similar to jobs that you have previously browsed.
The Cookie Preferences link on our website provides a list of the Cookies we use in your jurisdiction, why we use them and what types of Cookies they are.
How to manage or reject Cookies
When you first visit our website(s) you will be asked to choose what kind of Cookies you want to receive. We ask for your prior consent for some Cookies via the Cookie Preferences link, while we may set strictly necessary Cookies without your consent. You may also use the privacy settings within your browser to do this. Please be aware that rejecting all Cookies through your browser’s privacy settings will mean that you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website's features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences.
You can update your given consent at any time via the Cookie Preferences link. You may also choose to opt-out of Cookies which are not strictly necessary to perform basic features of our website by changing your browser settings. If you use the Cookie Preferences link to update your choice of Cookies, please note that this does not result in deletion of already placed Cookies on your device. If you want to delete these Cookies you should do so using your browser’s privacy settings.
If you choose to delete all Cookies through your browser’s privacy settings, this will also delete any record of having opted-out that may be stored by a Cookie on your device (so that the opt-out can continue to be actioned) and you may need to actively opt-out again.
third party services
In the course of using our services, Candidates, Temporary Workers and Staff Alumni may wish to access independent websites and third party services (e.g. job platforms) which are not operated by us. Such independent sites and third parties are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent sites, including whether to use any services offered by the third party.
Occasionally, third party service providers that we have engaged will process personal data that we given to them as a data controller in their own right, for example, for the purposes of: (i) conducting their own internal reporting, (ii) preventing or responding to threats to the security or integrity of their systems; (iii) establishing, exercising or defending their own legal claims; (iv) complying with legal obligations that apply to them; and (v) using personal data in anonymised or aggregated form to improve their own products and services. They will usually have their own privacy policies which set out more detail in relation to these processing activities.

Annex 3
Country-Specific Variations to our Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY TOPIC
JURISDICTION
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC LEGAL REQUIREMENT
HAYS' PROCESSING OF YOUR SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA
Ireland
Criminal Convictions
We only carry out criminal records checks where permitted by law.
DATA SUBJECT ACCESS REQUESTS (DSAR)
Ireland
We can restrict your access to personal data within the scope of a DSAR in certain circumstances where we establish and document that it is necessary and proportionate in accordance with local law
OTHER RIGHTS
Ireland
We have the right to refuse to respond to a request from you under the GDPR if one of the exemptions set out in local law applies e.g. in relation to the prevention and detection of criminal offences, establishing, exercising or defending of a legal claim or establishing legal rights and/or where material is legally privileged.
USE OF CANDIDATE, CLIENT, OR SUPPLIER DATA FOR MARKETING PURPOSES
Ireland
As described in the main body of our Privacy Policy, we are entitled to rely on "soft opt-in" consent in respect of certain marketing messages that we wish to send to you. This applies in relation to direct marketing by electronic means to both private persons and businesses.
COOKIES
Ireland
We will ensure that the minimum requirements under local law are met in respect of placing cookies: (i) that clear information is provided to a website user as to the cookies to which he/she is being asked to consent to when using a website; and (ii) that website users have a means of refusing or giving consent to cookies which are not strictly necessary. Where consent is provided, it must be captured either explicitly or by implication.
HAYS' PROCESSING OF VIDEO RECORDINGS
Ireland
We may from time to time record your question and answer sessions and/or video interviews to support our recruitment services for you and our work in finding opportunities for Clients. The video recordings shall be shared with Clients and viewed via a secure third party platform. Video recordings will be removed from the third party platform once they are no longer needed or if a Candidate requests deletion. Video recordings will be retained by Hays in line with normal Hays’ retention policy.
HAYS' PROCESSING AND SHARING OF REFERENCES
Ireland
We adopt a policy of openness, where possible, in relation to references that referees provide about Candidates.
This means that if a Candidate wishes to see a reference that a referee has provided about them, we will endeavour to comply with the Candidate's request unless the referee objects to us doing so (and we will give the referee the opportunity to object).
As well as sharing references provided by a referee with the Candidate, we will also share references with third parties, such as Clients (e.g. those seeking to employ the Candidate) and MSP providers (e.g. if they request references while conducting an audit of the participants in an MSP programme) unless the referee objects to us doing so (and we will give the referee the opportunity to object).
Glossary
Candidates
- include individuals with whom Hays has not had prior contact, but whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in, or might benefit from, Hays’ services and being considered for any roles advertised or promoted by Hays including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' Clients (including those individuals who want to become Temporary Workers). Candidates also include applicants for such roles, as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job, and/or who have engaged with Hays about Hays’ services and/or any roles advertised or promoted by Hays. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays' Clients as part of an MSP offering or otherwise will be treated as Candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Clients
- while it speaks for itself, this category covers our customers, clients, and others to whom Hays provides services in the course of its business or whom Hays reasonably considers would be interested in our services. In certain circumstances, Hays provides services to individual employees who work for Client organisations, such as training courses to teaching staff who work for Clients in the education sector. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Clients to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Clients) to their employees.
Delete
– In this day and age it is virtually impossible to guarantee the permanent and irretrievable deletion of electronic data. In addition, as we have explained to you in this Privacy Policy, sometimes we will be obliged by law or regulation, or need for risk-management reasons, to retain the ability to access certain elements of personal data.  However, our commitment to you is that once your personal data reaches the end of its nominal retention period, or where we receive a valid request from you to erase it, we will put in place specific operational and Systems measures to ensure that your data is “put beyond use”. By this we mean that while the data will still technically exist on an archive system, we will ensure that it cannot be readily accessed by any of our operational Systems, processes or Staff. Only a very (and we mean exceptionally) small number of senior Staff, in very (and, again, we mean exceptionally) limited and carefully prescribed situations, will be able to restore your personal data so that it can be viewed for those legitimate purposes. Once we are clear that all relevant legally mandated retention periods have expired (which, for present purposes, we expect to be the period of ten years), we will go the additional final step of undertaking a “hard delete”, whereby not even that very limited number of senior Staff would be able to restore your personal data.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
– a European Union statutory instrument which aims to harmonise European data protection laws. It has an effective date of 25 May 2018, and any references to it should be construed accordingly to include any related national data protection legislation.
Managed Service Provider (MSP) programmes
– Clients' outsourcing of the management of external staff (including freelance workers, independent contractors and temporary employees) to an external recruitment provider.
Other people whom Hays may contact
– these may include Candidates' and Hays' Staff emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.
Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services
– full or partial outsourcing of the recruitment process for permanent employees to a recruitment provider.
Staff
– includes current and former employees and interns engaged directly in the business of Hays (or who have accepted an offer to be engaged) as well as certain other workers who are or were engaged in the business of providing services to Hays (even though they are not classed as employees). For these purposes we also include employees of Hays who are engaged to work on Clients' premises under the terms of RPO or MSP agreements. To be clear, 'Staff' does not include individuals hired by Hays for the purpose of being placed with Clients outside of an RPO/MSP arrangement. These individuals are treated in the same way as Hays' Candidates and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Likewise, independent contractors and consultants performing services for Hays fall within the definition of a 'Supplier' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Suppliers
– refers to partnerships and companies (including sole traders), and atypical workers such as independent contractors and freelance workers, who provide services to Hays. In certain circumstances Hays will sub-contract the services it provides to Clients to third party suppliers who perform services on Hays' behalf. In this context, suppliers that are individual contractors, freelance workers, or employees of suppliers will be treated as Candidates for data protection purposes. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Suppliers to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Candidates) to their employees.
Staff Alumni
– refers to former members of Staff who have expressed their wish to remain part of Hays' alumni network and to use Hays' alumni portal.
Systems
– telephone, computer, internet and Wi-Fi systems, software and portals, accounts and/or networks belonging, controlled or used by Hays that are used to transmit, undertake and/or receive communications or are otherwise used in the course of Hays' business, including candidate portal software and CRM systems.
Temp Relationship
– means our contractual relationship with Temporary Workers while they are employed or engaged directly by us.
Temporary Workers
– includes someone who becomes employed or engaged by Hays for the purposes of undertaking temporary work for a Client or other Hays group company. If you are a Temporary Worker, we will also continue to process your personal data as a Candidate throughout the duration of your temporary work assignment and thereafter, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. The question of whether and the extent to which the Recruits Privacy Policy and the Staff Privacy Policy apply to you as a Temporary Worker depends on local law requirements.

.
UK GDPR
– the GDPR as it forms part of the Laws of the UK by virtue of Section 3 of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
Visitors
– means individuals who visit Hays premises but who are not members of Hays' Staff.
Website Users
– any individual who accesses any of the Hays websites or any of the Hays mobile applications (apps).
