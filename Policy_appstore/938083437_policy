Our application is free for you, but it contains advertising. On devices with Android, we use the standard Android advertising identifier solely for advertising and analyzing its performance. An advertising identifier can be associated with data that allows you to establish the identity of the user, or permanent device identifiers, such as SSAID, MAC address or IMEI, only with your explicit consent.
Our application does not contain any tools other than the Android advertising identifier, and therefore for its own purposes:
Does not collect any personal information.
Does not track the location of users.
Not connected with any social networks.
We just do not need to know anything about you.

We assure you that you should not worry about the security of your sensitive data when using our application.
