TRANSFERS OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland (collectively "Europe") to other countries that may not have the same level of data protection that applies in your jurisdiction.

STORAGE AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information based on the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal information will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of that data.
For further information on applicable data retention periods, please contact us (see "

TRANSFERS OF YOUR INFORMATION
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and Japan. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law wherever the data is located.
We may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), UK, and Switzerland (collectively "Europe") to other countries that may not have the same level of data protection that applies in your jurisdiction. For the data transfers from Europe to the U.S., WatchGuard relies on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Program (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) to the extent the regulations giving effect to these programs have come into force and as long as each of these programs remains a lawful mechanism to transfer your personal data. Where we cannot rely on EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as lawful mechanisms to transfer your personal information (including where we transfer data to countries other than the U.S.) we use a variety of legal mechanisms to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of European data approved by the European Commission, or where required, we will ask you for your prior consent.
Data Privacy Framework (for WatchGuard Technologies, Inc. only)
WatchGuard complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  WatchGuard has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  WatchGuard has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
WatchGuard's participation in the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF applies to all personal information that is subject to this Policy and that is received from the EEA, the UK and Switzerland and processed by WatchGuard. We will comply with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles (“DPF Principles”) in respect of such personal information. To learn what types of personal data we collect and process and the purposes of such processing, please refer to “
Information Collected
” and “
Why We Collect and How We Use Your Information
” sections of this Policy. Information about the types of third parties to which we disclose your personal information and the purposes for which we do so are described in the section called “
Sharing of Personal Information
” above.
In accordance with the DPF Principles, EEA, UK and Swiss individuals have a right of access to personal information we process about them and are able to submit a request to correct, amend, or delete such information. If you reside in EEA, the UK or Switzerland you also have the right to opt out and prevent us from (1) disclosing your personal information to third parties (other than those acting as our agents to perform tasks on our behalf or per our instructions), and (2) using your personal information for the purposes that are materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected. Other privacy rights described in “
Your Privacy Rights
” section may also be available to you. Please submit a request to
privacy@watchguard.com
to exercise any of these rights.
If we have received your personal information in the United States and subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting as an agent, and such third-party agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
WatchGuard is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
In certain situations, WatchGuard may be required to disclose personal information that we process under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or to enforce contractual obligations.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, WatchGuard commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the U.S. pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. EEA, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact WatchGuard at:
privacy@watchguard.com
.
WatchGuard has further committed to refer unresolved DPF Principles-related complaints to an independent U.S. based dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers
for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2
.
We reserve the right to amend this section from time to time consistent with the Data Privacy Framework requirements.
STORAGE AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information based on the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal information will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of that data.
For further information on applicable data retention periods, please contact us (see "
How to Contact Us
" below).
