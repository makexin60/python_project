CALIFORNIA NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE / COLORADO BONA FIDE LOYALTY PROGRAM
CCPA’s implementing regulations define a “financial incentive” as a program, benefit, or other offering “related to the collection, deletion, or sale of personal information.” Likewise, the CPA’s implementing rules define a “Bona Fide Loyalty Program” as a program “established for the genuine purpose of providing discounts, rewards, or other actual value” to members that voluntarily participate in the program. Marriott International offers guests the opportunity to participate in the Marriott Bonvoy Loyalty Program (the “
Program
”), which may provide benefits, including discounted rates on stays, as well as the opportunity to earn points that can be redeemed for discounted or free stays or other items, to those who choose to join. Those benefits are described along with other material terms and conditions
here
. Our collection of members’ Personal Data (including name, zip code, email address, and other Personal Data as described above under “Personal Data We Collect, Disclose, Share, and Sell”) allows Marriott to operate the Program and provide membership benefits. Marriott uses the Personal Data of Program members, including their stay details, to both award and redeem points. Otherwise, the types of Personal Data that we collect from Program members are generally similar to the types of Personal Data that we collect from individuals who are not Program members. The amount of Personal Data that we collect from a member or non-member may vary and is dependent on the level of interactions and engagement that the member or non-member has with Marriott.
Marriott seeks to ensure that both members and non-members have a memorable and enjoyable experience when staying at a Marriott hotel. For this reason, in connection with a hotel stay, Marriott may collect information from both members and non-members related to their personal preferences, as described in the section titled “The Data We Collect” in the
Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement
. Program members can organize their Personal Data and preferences as part of their Program profile. For example, a Program profile may include address, phone, month and day of birth, and gender, as well as room options, stay preferences, and communication preferences.
Marriott may also collect Personal Data about Program members through its Partner Programs, as defined in Marriott’s
Loyalty Program Terms & Conditions
, as well as through Linked Accounts, such as with airline frequent flyer programs or retail or cruise partners, as explained in the
Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement
. When a Program member engages with a Partner Program or has a Linked Account, Marriott receives information necessary to facilitate point redemptions or earnings. The partner benefits available to a member depends on the level and interactions from that member.
Marriott "sells," as the term is defined under the CCPA, Personal Data of both Program members and non-members to Advertising Partners and Authorized Licensees for the purposes of marketing and online advertising, as disclosed above in this Privacy Statement. The following details are disclosed in this Privacy Statement, above, under the section titled “Personal Data We Collect, Disclose, Share, and Sell”:
Categories of Personal Data sold to third parties;
Categories of Personal Data, including Sensitive Data, processed for purposes of targeted advertising; and
Categories of third parties that will receive members’ Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Data.
For example, when a Program member purchases a timeshare property from Marriott Vacations Worldwide (“MVW”), Marriott receives information from MVW so that the MVW Owners can receive various program benefits, including Elite Status Upgrades, Elite Night Credits for their timeshare stays, and the ability to convert their timeshare interest into Program points. In addition, Personal Data received from Marriott’s credit card partners may include information for servicing and facilitating the Program member’s point earnings through use of the credit card. Marriott may also receive the member’s category level spend (e.g., how much the member spent on groceries) and information that may assist in presenting relevant ads to our members and non-members.
If you are a California or Colorado resident and opted out of our “sale” of your Personal Data before you joined the Program, you will need to opt out again once you are a member, if you do not wish for Marriott to “sell” your Personal Data. To do so, click on “
Your Privacy Choices
” or call 1-800-218-9316.
We estimate the value of a member’s Personal Data to Marriott International, solely for purposes of the CCPA and pursuant to the valuation options mandated by the CCPA regulations, to be on average approximately $0.54 per Consumer in 2023. This estimate is not specific to any individual Consumer and varies per Consumer. We have based this good faith estimate on the value that arises from our commercial relationships and the collection and retention of the Personal Data of Consumers who have voluntarily signed up and chosen to remain in the Program. The value of Program benefits to members varies significantly as individual members take advantage of Program benefits to varying degrees.
You may join the Program on our
website
, at a participating property, or through another enrollment channel in line with the
Bonvoy Program Terms & Conditions
.
Members who are California or Colorado residents may exercise their privacy rights (i.e., the rights to know, to request deletion, and to opt out of the sale of Personal Data) without any effect on their membership status or eligibility to receive rewards, and Program members who exercise their privacy rights under U.S. State laws receive the same benefits as members who do not. A member may also choose not to receive marketing updates or offers at any time without any effect on their membership status or eligibility to receive Program benefits.
You may cancel your membership at any time by notifying Member Support at:
Marriott Guest Services
910 West Legacy Center Way, Suite 100
Midvale, UT 84047
Or by fax: 1-801-468-4033.

Washington and Nevada Consumer Health Data Privacy Statement
Print Page
Last Updated: March 19, 2024
Pursuant to the Washington My Health My Data Act and the Nevada Consumer Health Privacy Law (together the “Health Privacy Laws”), the Marriott Group (“Marriott” or “We”) is providing the following details regarding the categories of Consumer Health Data that we collect, use, and share about Washington and Nevada residents. This Washington and Nevada Consumer Health Data Privacy Statement (the “Health Data Privacy Statement”) supplements the
Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement
(“Global Privacy Statement”).
CONSUMER HEALTH DATA
For purposes of this Health Data Privacy Statement, “Consumer Health Data” is a subset of Personal Data (as defined in the
Global Privacy Statement
) and extends further to mean Personal Data that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies the consumer's past, present, or future physical or mental health status.
CONSUMER HEALTH DATA WE COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE
The Consumer Health Data we may collect from you will depend on the context of your interactions with Marriott.
Examples of Consumer Health Data include:
In connection with providing our spa services, we may request information from you regarding various health conditions, or indication of pregnancy, as needed to safely provide spa services.
In connection with responding to or submitting a personal injury claim, we may collect information regarding your health conditions, surgeries, procedures, medications, or other interventions.
As described above and further in ‘The Data We Collect’ section of the
Global Privacy Statement
, we collect Consumer Health Data directly from you. We may also receive Consumer Health Data about you from third parties with your authorization.
USE OF CONSUMER HEALTH DATA
Marriott collects, uses, and shares the Consumer Health Data listed above with your consent, or as reasonably necessary to provide you with services you have requested or authorized.  We may use and share Consumer Health Data to operate, manage, and maintain our business, to provide our services, and to accomplish our business purposes and objectives, including, for example, to undertake quality and safety assurance measures; conduct internal investigations; comply with law, legal process, and internal policies; maintain records; and exercise and defend legal claims.
We may also use and share Consumer Health Data with a third party in the context of any reorganization, financing transaction, merger, sale, joint venture, partnership, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
We may share Consumer Health Data with the following categories of third parties:
Our Affiliates.
We may enable access to Consumer Health Data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems or where access helps us to provide our services and operate our business. A full list of our affiliates can be found
here

Service Providers.
We may share Consumer Health Data with vendors or processors working on our behalf for the purposes described above; for example, with providers that host our spa scheduling software and our claims database.
Governmental Agencies.
We may disclose Consumer Health Data to law enforcement or other government agencies when we believe doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process.
Other Third Parties.
In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to provide Consumer Health Data to other third parties, for example, to comply with the law or to protect our rights or those of our customers, or in connection with a corporate transaction.
We do not “sell” Consumer Health Data, as defined in the Health Privacy Laws. We do not permit third parties to collect Consumer Health Data over time and across different internet websites or online services on our Online Services. For more information about our Online Services, please see the Global Privacy Statement.

Marriott Group Privacy Statement for the Collection of Non-Employee and Non-Guest Personal Data
1. Introduction
The Marriott Group, which includes Marriott International, Inc. and its affiliates (“Marriott,” “we,” “our”), is committed to protecting the Personal Data it collects, stores and uses. This Privacy Statement covers Personal Data of individuals other than Marriott Associates, such as contractors, consultants, Franchise Hotel employees, business partners, and non-guests (“you,” “your”). For avoidance of doubt the Personal Data of Marriott Associates is covered by the
Associate Personal Data Privacy Statement
↗, and the Personal Data of guests is covered by the
Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement
, and not this Statement.
2. Purpose
The collection and use of your Personal Data enables Marriott to engage in business planning and operational processes, such as project implementation, providing training, and administering discount programs to others besides Marriott Associates and guests.
3. What Data Marriott Collects, Uses, Transfers and Shares, and Why
