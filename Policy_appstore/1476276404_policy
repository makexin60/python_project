WHO DO YOU SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH?
To provide the Website and our services, we work with a number of carefully selected third parties. To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:
Group companies for business purposes:
Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Browns (South Molton Street) Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co. Ltd (the “Farfetch Group”). We may share your personal information in order to operate our business and provide the Website and services. Rest assured, their use of information is consistent with this Privacy Policy;
Third party service providers for business purposes:
We have subcontracted the operation of certain aspects of the Site to Black & White, a trading division of Farfetch UK Limited (company number 06400760, VAT number GB 204 0769 35). Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics
advertisers for marketing purposes:
we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;
third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:
the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;
to comply with legal requests:
on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries/regions, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and
aggregated information with third parties:
we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.
