Privacy Notices
At CCEA, we’re committed to respecting and protecting your personal information. Our Privacy Notices explain how and why we collect personal information, how we use it, what personal information is involved, the legal basis for collecting personal information and how we keep it secure. Any personal information collected will be held securely and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation.
When we talk about CCEA, this includes information held by both the CCEA Awarding Organisation and CCEA Regulation.
CCEA interacts with many people on a daily basis, each differing in experience and user need. We have identified 4 categories of users about whom we collect, process and hold personal information – Learners, CCEA Staff, CCEA Contracted for Services personnel and Job Applicants. As the requirements and processing of these 4 groups differ slightly, we have developed 4 separate Privacy Notices in order to provide clarity and transparency. The 4 Privacy Notices can be found below.
Data Protection Act and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Any information you provide will be held securely and in accordance with the
Data Protection Act 2018
and the
UK General Data Protection Regulation
. CCEA has a legal duty to protect any information collected from you.
CCEA interact with many people on a daily basis, each differing in experience and user need. To help you identify the information we collect, CCEA has produced the following Privacy Notices:

Changes to the Privacy Notices
From time to time, our Privacy Notices may change. This will not reduce your rights without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Notice changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Notice changes). We will also keep prior versions of our Privacy Notices in an archive.

Privacy Notices
At CCEA, we’re committed to respecting and protecting your personal information. Our Privacy Notices explain how and why we collect personal information, how we use it, what personal information is involved, the legal basis for collecting personal information and how we keep it secure. Any personal information collected will be held securely and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation.
When we talk about CCEA, this includes information held by both the CCEA Awarding Organisation and CCEA Regulation.
CCEA interacts with many people on a daily basis, each differing in experience and user need. We have identified 4 categories of users about whom we collect, process and hold personal information – Learners, CCEA Staff, CCEA Contracted for Services personnel and Job Applicants. As the requirements and processing of these 4 groups differ slightly, we have developed 4 separate Privacy Notices in order to provide clarity and transparency. The 4 Privacy Notices can be found below.
Data Protection Act and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Any information you provide will be held securely and in accordance with the
Data Protection Act 2018
and the
UK General Data Protection Regulation
. CCEA has a legal duty to protect any information collected from you.
CCEA interact with many people on a daily basis, each differing in experience and user need. To help you identify the information we collect, CCEA has produced the following Privacy Notices:

Changes to the Privacy Notices
From time to time, our Privacy Notices may change. This will not reduce your rights without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Notice changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Notice changes). We will also keep prior versions of our Privacy Notices in an archive.
