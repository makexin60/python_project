Darts Score Board Lite Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Darts Score Board Lite
("the App") is developed to provide an easy way to keep track of darts game scores and statistics. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your data.
1. Information We Collect
The App does
not
collect any personal or sensitive information. However, users may enter their
names
to display on the darts scoreboard and in the game statistics. This data is stored
locally on your device
and is not shared with any third parties.
2. Device Permissions
The App does
not
request access to any device permissions (e.g., camera, location, contacts, or microphone).
3. Data Storage and Usage
All game data, including scores, statistics, and entered player names, are stored
locally
on your device. The App does not upload or transfer any data to external servers.
4. In-App Purchases
The App includes
in-app purchases
that allow you to unlock advanced functionality. All purchases are processed through
Apple’s App Store
and governed by Apple’s payment policies. The App does not store any payment information.
5. Third-Party Services
The App does
not
integrate with any third-party services, including advertising networks, analytics tools, or tracking services.
6. Children’s Privacy
The App is
not designed for children
under the age of 13 (or under 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
The App does not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies.
8. Your Privacy Rights
Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. To remove game data or player names, you can uninstall the App.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated policy will take effect immediately upon posting.
