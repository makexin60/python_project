TG4 Privacy Statement
TG4 respects the privacy of all viewers who access TG4 programming through   our players,  through  our social media sites which are hosted by third party platforms  and the privacy of  all  members of the public who engage with TG4 by phone, text, post, email, social media or audience participation. The term players include tg4.ie, tg4.com, tg4.tv, cúla4.com, ponc.com, cine4.ie, gradam.ie, molscéal.ie and any other players which TG4 creates from time to time. Our players can be accessed through the TG4 website or through TG4 applications (“TG4 App”).
This Privacy Statement outlines our policy concerning the collection and use of personal data which is gathered by TG4 from viewers and members of the public who engage with TG4 as described above. Personal data is any information relating to a living individual that enables the identification of that individual.
Any processing of personal information gathered by TG4 as described above is governed by the provisions of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (as amended) the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulations 2018 (“GDPR”). TG4 is the data controller under GDPR rules. Any third-party processing personal data on TG4’s behalf is called a data processor and TG4 will ensure that contractual protections are in place with that data processor to protect your personal data.
TG4 is not responsible for the privacy practices of any external websites, device manufacturers or platforms which you use to access TG4 services. These third parties have their own privacy statements which will be different to TG4’s Privacy Statement and you should read their privacy and cookies policy.
The aim of this privacy policy is to explain how TG4 collects and uses the personal information it gathers about you. TG4 will ensure that it keeps all personal information supplied by you in accordance with its obligations under current Data Protection legislation and GDPR.
In general, any information you provide to TG4 will only be used within TG4 and by its agents and service providers. However, your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to our online services or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on our online services TG4 can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
A separate short privacy policy will be in place for individual programmes which may differ slightly from this Privacy Statement and the programme specific privacy policy should be read in addition to this Privacy Statement.
What personal information does TG4 collect when you access the players?
We collect registration information when you register to use our online services including the TG4 player.  This data includes your name, email address, the password you enter to set up and to access your account, age, gender, county of residence, country of residence, your marketing choices, and your year of birth.   If you register through Facebook, Google or through your email login details your personal data will be available to those third-party companies and it can be used by them in accordance with their privacy policies.
We will verify the location of your device while using the players and the TG4 social media sites to control access to certain TG4 programming which is not available outside of the island of Ireland.
When you enter a competition TG4 may collect information such as your name, postal address, email address or mobile phone number. This information is not disclosed to any third party unless we receive your consent.
You may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, email address and mobile phone number if you sign up to TG4 email alert services which TG4 may from time to time provide. This information is not disclosed to any third party unless we receive your consent.
If you apply to participate or actually participate in a programme as an audience member or contributor TG4 may collect your name, postal address, email address and contact number.
If you have registered for a TG4 account and you consent to receive communications from our commercial partners, we may then use your personal data to help us to select advertising for you based on your preferences and viewing patterns and may also analyse your engagement with the advertisements which have been selected for you. If you are under 18 years of age, please ask your parent or guardian for their permission to provide us with your contact information.
If you do not have an account with TG4 and you access the TG4 online services, we may collect certain personal data as outlined in our cookies policy.
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested and remove it when the purpose has been met.  Therefore, when personal data is provided by users who set up an account it will be kept by TG4 for as long as the account remains opened.
Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered  for TG4 online services but have taken part in TG4 online services (e.g. competitions), that information will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We may hold a list of winners for archival purposes and may broadcast these for 1 year after the competition is over and after this the competition entry list will be deleted.
If you are notified on TG4.ie that your information may be used to allow TG4 to contact you for “service administration purposes”, this means that TG4 may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended for maintenance.
We may collect service data, which is information about any service errors or interruptions that you have encountered in order to help us to make technical improvements to our services.
We will not contact you for promotional purposes, such as notifying you of improvements to the service or new online services unless you specifically agree to be contacted for such purposes at the time you submit your information on the online services, or at a later time if you sign up specifically to receive such promotional information.
Cookies Policy – Information TG4 collects from you when you visit the players on the TG4 website
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
On TG4’s website, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the players to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website’s features.
During the course of any visit to the TG4 website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Information on how long you have spent on these pages is also supplied by the cookies.  Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors (including international visitors) and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to a certain genre of programme, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight this type of programme on your second and subsequent visits.
