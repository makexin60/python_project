Privacy Notice
The purpose of this notice is to inform you of the data relating to you that we collect and use in connection with this website and the uses (including disclosures to third parties) we make of such data.
General statement
We are the Law Society of Ireland of Blackhall Place, Dublin 7, Ireland (the “
Law Society of Ireland
”, “
we
”, “
us
”, “
our
”) - the educational, representative and regulatory body of the solicitors' profession in Ireland.
We take our responsibilities under applicable data protection law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation and implementing legislation such as the Data Protection Act 2018, very seriously. The purpose of this notice is to inform you of the data relating to you that we collect and use in connection with this website and the uses (including disclosures to third parties) we make of such data.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any linked sites. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such. Some technical terms used in this statement are explained at the end of this page.
If you have any questions about our use of your personal data, please contact
dataprivacy@lawsociety.ie
.
Collection and use of personal information
The Law Society of Ireland does not collect any personal data about you on this website, apart from information which you volunteer (for example by emailing us, using our online feedback form or by making a purchase or event booking). This personal data may include:
your name and contact details, including your address, phone number and email address;
your credit/debit card or bank account details;
any other personal data relating to you that you provide to us or that we generate about you in connection with your use of this website.
Collection and use of technical information
When you visit our website, the following information is retained about that visit:
the IP address of the visitor’s web server;
the top-level domain name used (for example .ie, .com, .org, .net);
the previous website address from which the visitor reached us, including any search terms used;
Google analytics which shows the traffic of visitors around this web site (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded);
the type of web browser and operating system used by the website visitor.
The Law Society of Ireland will make no attempt to identify individual visitors, or to associate the technical details listed above with any individual. It is the policy of the Law Society never to disclose such technical information in respect of individual website visitors to any third party (apart from our internet service provider, which records such data on our behalf and which is bound by confidentiality provisions in this regard), unless obliged to disclose such information by law. The technical information will be used only by the Law Society of Ireland, and only for statistical and other administrative purposes.
Purposes of processing and legal basis
We will use personal data relating to you for the purposes of:
dealing with any queries that you have submitted to us via the website;
processing applications and transactions submitted through the website;
improving and developing this website;
carrying out research and user surveys;
sending you promotional and marketing materials, subject to any preferences that you express when we collect your contact details or subsequently. You can opt out of receiving promotional and marketing materials from us at any time by contacting
dataprivacy@lawsociety.ie
;
generating and analysing statistics regarding usage of this website, including the frequency of use of individual pages (where possible, personal data will be anonymised before being used for this purpose);
fraud prevention, investigation and detection;
establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.
The legal bases on which we process your personal data are that this is necessary for:
our legitimate interests in conducting our business in ensuring the proper management and functioning of the Law Society. We will not process your personal data for these purposes if to do so would constitute an unwarranted interference with your own interests, rights and freedoms
compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that applies to us; and
the performance of a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel
We may from time to time use Facebook Advertising, Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing, and communications. This tool allows us to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous and we cannot see the personal data of any individual user.
However, the collected data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook may be able to connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own advertising purposes (in accordance with
Facebook’s Data Use Policy
). Facebook has ultimate control of the information gathered through Facebook Advertising, Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing, and communications. You can opt out of Facebook’s use of cookies and Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing through settings on your Facebook Account.
Recipients of Personal Data
We may disclose your personal data to other organisations in connection with the above purposes, including:
to third parties who we engage to provide services to us in connection with this website, such as outsourced service providers, IT services providers, professional advisers and auditors;
to competent regulatory authorities and bodies as requested or required by law; and
digital marketing and analytics service providers.
Transfers Abroad
In connection with the above, we might transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area by enabling remote access to your personal data by our service providers for support services, including to a jurisdiction which is not recognised by the European Commission as providing for an equivalent level of protection for personal data as is provided for in the European Union. If and to the extent that we do so, we will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to comply with our obligations under applicable law governing such transfers. These may include entering into a contract governing the transfer that contains the ‘standard contractual clauses’ approved for this purpose by the European Commission. If you would like to receive further details of the measures that we have taken in this regard, please contact
dataprivacy@lawsociety.ie
.
Retention
We will not hold your personal data for longer than is necessary. We retain your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes described in this Notice, or to comply with our obligations under applicable law and, if relevant, to deal with any claim or dispute that might arise between you and us.
Requirement to provide personal data
You are not under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide us with any personal data. However, where you submit a query to us in the ‘Contact Us’ section of our website or submit a form such as registration for an account on our website or to sign up for one of our newsletters, we will ask you to provide certain information, such as your name and email address. If you do not provide this information, we may not be in a position to process your request.
Unsolicited Correspondence and Third Party Data
The Law Society may occasionally receive unsolicited correspondence from members of the public or solicitors which contains personal data relating to third parties (“Third Party Data”). We may process such Third Party Data for the purpose of replying to correspondence, dealing with queries and complying with our legal and regulatory obligations. The legal basis on which we process Third Party Data is that this is necessary for our legitimate interests in conducting our business and ensuring the proper management and functioning of the Law Society. If you would like to receive further details about our use of Third Party Data, please contact us at
dataprivacy@lawsociety.ie
.
