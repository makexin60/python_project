When you visit the www.nperf.com website, published by NPERF ("the Website"), information about your browsing may be stored in files called "cookies"       installed on your device.
This Policy will help you have a better understanding of the provisions we put in place to process browsing information when you visit the Website. It       informs you about all cookies on the Website and provides you with the procedure to configure them.
1. What are Cookies?
"Cookies" are small text files of limited size that allow us, as an issuer, to recognise your terminal, computer, tablet or mobile and record each time       the terminal accesses digital content containing cookies from the issuer, during the cookie's period of validity or registration.
Cookie files can only be read by their issuer.
Some cookies are essential for the use of the Sites, others allow the optimisation and personalisation of the displayed content.
The deposit of trackers is subject to consent unless they are strictly necessary for the functioning of the Website and the provision of our services.
The cookies used on our Website are of the following types:
Technical cookies
These cookies are essential for browsing our Website (such as session IDs, browser IDs and your consent record) that allow you to use the main           features and secure your connection. They allow you for example to access reserved and personal spaces on our website, thanks to the login details or           data that you may have entrusted us with previously. Without these cookies, you will not be able to use our website in a functional way.
These cookies are so-called "session" cookies, their lifespan equals that of your session on the Website.
Without these cookies, you will not be able to use our Website normally.
Analytical and performance cookies
These cookies establish statistics concerning the frequency and use of various elements of our Website such as the contents or pages that you have           visited in order to enable us to understand the Website's use and performances and to improve its functioning and ergonomics. These analytical           cookies are implemented by Google Analytics.
Rejecting or deleting cookies does not affect your browsing of the Website but is likely to prevent us from ensuring the best quality of                    services we want to offer our Website users.
Advertising cookies
These cookies collect information about users' browsing habits to show them advertisements more relevant to their interests.
NPERF does not use advertising cookies.

Most Internet browsers are configured to accept cookies by default. Your browser offers you the opportunity to modify these standard settings so that all       cookies are rejected systematically or that only part of the cookies are accepted or rejected according to their issuer. Your browser also allows       notification when new cookies may be placed on your device. Each Internet browser has its own cookie management settings.
