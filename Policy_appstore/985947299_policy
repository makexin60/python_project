Furthermore, our employees and third party service providers have access to your non-public personal information only on a "need to know" basis. We follow industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
                 electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Links to other websites
Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
Contests
If you choose to enroll to a trading contest, you acknowledge that the contest registration is with the sponsoring broker and the information you provide at contest registration will be shared with the broker for account opening.
Contest accounts cannot be deleted or made private during or after the contest has ended.
Miscellaneous
In the event that any provision of this Privacy Policy is held unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected, and the unenforceable provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
