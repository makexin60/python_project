What are the major categories of cookies?
There are two major categories of cookies that correspond to different legal regimes.

either accept them by expressly consenting to their installation and use (it being specified that the user will then have the possibility of retracting their consent at any time under the conditions and according to the methods stipulated in Article 4 hereunder),
or refuse them.

rposes, the user is invited to consult Article 3 hereunder.

The purpose of these cookies is to allow us to personalize advertising, i.e. to select and distribute advertising for your attention based on your browsing, your location, and also the content and/or products and/or services and/or advertisements you have previously viewed, and then to evaluate their distribution and their effectiveness (i.e. audience and performance, among other things), and in this case in contexts other than on our Site and/or our mobile game applications, e.g. on third-party websites or applications.
To this end, information regarding your usage of our Site and/or our mobile game applications, and also of other websites and applications is collected and cross-referenced (e.g. information that allows us to find out where you are located, what content and/or products and/or services and/or advertisements were displayed, how often they were displayed, how long they were displayed for, at what time and where they were displayed, and also if you reacted in response to the content and/or products and/or services and/or advertisements, for example, if you clicked on them or made a purchase) in order to determine by deduction your areas of interest, among other things, for the purposes of selecting and distributing to you personalized/targeted/geolocated advertisements on various third-party websites or applications.
Installation of the cookies detailed below is subject to your prior consent obtained in accordance with Article 4 hereof.

In what circumstances and how do we obtain your consent to install cookies? What are your rights with regard to cookies?
Circumstances for obtaining consent, the scope of your consent, and exceptions
Important: The information below regarding your consent to or refusal of the use of cookies applies independently to our Site and to each of our mobile game applications. Furthermore, your consent or refusal/retraction of consent is obtained independently with regard to the use of cookies on our Site and on each of our game applications.
For example, your consent to the use of one or other cookie(s) on our Site does not constitute consent to the use of the same cookies or similar cookies on all or any of our mobile game applications. Furthermore, your settings for cookies used on our Site are separate from any settings you may opt for on our mobile game applications.
3.1.   The installation of a cookie on a computer or terminal, as well as reading of this cookie via our Site or our mobile game applications, are in principle
subject to the consent of the user
, i.e. to a free, specific, clear and unequivocal demonstration of the user’s will granting their agreement for this purpose, and doing so
separately for each purpose pursued by the cookies concerned
. This consent is obtained via our
cookie management module (accessible from
the footer of every page of our Site by clicking on the Cookie Management Module link or, in the case of our mobile applications, directly in the application)
under the terms and conditions detailed below.
Furthermore, during the user’s first visit to our Site or to one of our mobile game applications, they are asked if they accept the cookies for which consent must be obtained, classed into different categories according to their purpose, before such cookies are installed on their computer or terminal. The cookies that are subject to such consent  are not installed until the user expressly accepts them, either comprehensively by clicking on the Accept All button, which allows you to accept all cookies, or distributively for each purpose by clicking the Accept button, which allows you to accept each of the categories (i.e. by purpose) of the cookies concerned using our cookie management module (i.e. the module provides the user with the opportunity to consent to or refuse the use of cookies depending on their purpose).
Important:
– In cases where your consent is required, such consent is strictly optional, and you can simply refuse to grant it.
In any case, if you give your consent to the installation and reading of all or some of these cookies,
you will of course retain the possibility to retract your consent at any later date using the cookie management module.
– Furthermore, unless you express your will to the contrary using our cookie management module under the terms and conditions detailed below,
your choice (comprehensive
consent, partial consent, or refusal) will be retained for a period of 6 months, at the end of which time you will be asked again for your consent to or refusal of the installation of such cookies.
3.2
Exception to consent for so-called “functional” cookies used by our Site and our mobile game applications.
Such cookies are not subject to your prior consent. Furthermore, these cookies are installed automatically when you browse our Site or use our mobile game applications, without your prior consent being obtained. Insofar as these cookies are necessary to offer you a better user experience or to allow you to benefit from certain functions of our Site and/or our mobile applications, we do not offer you any dedicated technical means to refuse the installation of these cookies or to disable them. However, you have the option of (as you do with certain other cookies) disabling them by other means, for example by using the functions offered by your browser or terminal, while bearing in mind that in this case you risk not being able to access our Site or our mobile game applications, and/or not receiving correctly the content and information available on, and/or not being able to benefit from all the functionality of our Site or our mobile game applications.
The practical methods of obtaining your choices with regard to cookies (consent/refusal)
The cookie management module holds information for the user about the cookies that may be installed/read in their terminal as a result of browsing our Site and/or using our mobile game applications (see also the details of these cookies in Article 3 hereof). It displays on our Site and on our mobile game applications during the user’s first visit and then, regardless of the user’s choice (comprehensive consent, partial consent, or refusal), displays again every 6 months. It will also display again if the user deletes their cookies using the functions of their browser or their terminal.
The module offers the user several choices:
either to consent comprehensively to the use of all the cookies by clicking on Accept All: all the cookies will then be installed,
or to refuse comprehensively the use of all the cookies by clicking on Refuse All: only “functional” cookies will then be installed,
or to personalize their choice by managing in a more careful way the cookies they accept (or refuse). In this case, the user is asked to click on the Authorize or Refuse buttons for each category of cookies concerned in our cookie management module, and in order to personalize their choices (on the understanding that, in the case of “functional” cookies that are not subject to prior consent, such cookies will be installed by default and cannot be refused by the user via our cookie management module), the user will then have to register their choices by clicking on Validate My Choices. It is accepted as a principle that if the user has not clicked Authorize for a cookie (regardless of whether or not they have clicked Refuse for that cookie), the cookie will be regarded as refused and not installed. This page also offers the user to Accept All or Refuse All.
The user can also configure their choices with regard to the companies (third parties) using cookies on the Site and/or on our mobile game applications and the destination companies of the data collected through such cookies by specifying if they want to identify such companies as Authorized or Blocked, it being understood that:
in principle, when a user consents to a category/a purpose of cookies, then all the partners using those cookies and/or all the companies that may be destinations of the data collected in this way are automatically considered Authorized (but only for the purposes of cookies authorized by the user);
the user has the ability to refuse some of the partners using these cookies and/or all the companies that may be destinations for the data collected in this way by clicking, on the appropriate page of the cookie management module accessed via a button, on the Block button corresponding to the partners or destination companies that they want to refuse.
To access our cookie management module, click on the Cookie Management Module link that can be found in the footer of all the pages of our Site. In the case of our mobile game applications, the location of the module depends on the application.
In any case, all consent on your part to the use of cookies can be freely retracted at any time by deactivating one or more of the cookies in the manner described below.
The practical methods of modifying your choices with regard to cookies (retracting your consent or refusal)
You have available to you at all times several options for modifying the choices that you have made regarding cookies, in particular, retract your consent to or refuse their use (i.e. the installation/reading of cookies in your terminal).
3.3     You can at any time, simply and free of charge, on a distributive basis according to the purposes pursued by such cookies, choose to retract your consent to or refuse the use of cookies other than “functional” cookies on your computer or terminal using the cookie management module.
To do this, simply click on the Cookie Management Module link that can be found in the footer of all the pages of our Site. In the case of our mobile game applications, the location of the module depends on the application. Then:
click on the Refuse button corresponding to the cookies you want to uninstall,
register your choices by clicking on Validate My Choices.
Or:
click on the Refuse All button.
The user has the ability to configure their choices with regard to the partner companies using these cookies and the destinations for the data collected through such cookies by clicking, on the appropriate page of the cookie management module accessed as described above, the Block button corresponding to the partners or destination companies that they want to refuse.
3.4     You can also, if you prefer, have recourse to one of the options below.
Your browser settings (with regard to the cookies that may be used on our Site)
While most browsers are configured by default and accept the installation of cookies, the user has the possibility, if they wish to, of choosing in their browser settings to accept all cookies or to reject them systematically, or also to choose those cookies that they accept according to the issuer (on the condition that such a function is offered by their browser). Furthermore, the user can regularly delete the cookies on their terminal using their browser.
In any case, these operations must be performed for each terminal: tablets, smartphones, computers, etc.
You can thus freely configure your browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) in such a way that cookies will be:
accepted and installed on your computer or terminal: in this case, the cookies integrated into the pages and content that you view will be systematically installed,
refused: in this case, the cookies integrated into the pages and content that you view will not be installed,
subject every time to your choice: in this case, the installation of cookies will each time be subject to your acceptance or refusal.
To configure your choices for acceptance or refusal of cookies, you will have to take into account the configuration of each browser, as they are all different and change regularly. You will therefore need to refer to the help menu of your browser, which will allow you to find out how to change your cookie preferences. Examples:
For more information about Google Chrome:
https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=fr&hlrm=en
;
For more information about Firefox:
https://support.mozilla.org/fr/kb/autoriser-bloquer-cookies-preferences-sites?redirectlocale=fr&redirectslug=activer-desactiver-cookies-preferences
and
https://support.mozilla.org/fr/kb/desactiver-cookies-tiers
;
For more information about Internet Explorer:
https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies
;
For more information about Safari:
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/fr-ww/cookies/
and
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/fr-ww/
;
For more information about Edge:
https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy-microsoft-privacy
;
For more information about Opera™:
https://help.opera.com/en/latest/security-and-privacy/
and
https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies
.
Finally, it should be noted that in their current iterations, browsers:
do not all allow you to sort cookies by their purpose (which means that you are often constrained to choosing between Accept All and Refuse All) ;
do not all allow the user to give a valid expression of consent (which means that, despite the fact that you possibly have given consent to cookies via your browser, we will ask again for your specific consent under the conditions and in the manners cited above before any installation/reading by us of cookies that are subject to your consent);
do not all allow you to express a choice on technologies other than “cookies for tracking browsing” in the strictly limited sense of the term. Furthermore, it is possible that certain cookies, trackers, or other similar technologies are in principle not blocked (e.g.
device fingerprinting
) and can be installed and/or activated despite the fact that you have expressed your refusal via the settings of your browser.
As a result, it is recommended that you use our cookie management module (see above) to manage your choices with regard to cookies on our Site.
Configuration via professional digital advertising platforms
Several professional advertising platforms also offer users the opportunity to define their preferences with regard to targeted/behavioral advertising operated by member companies. In general, these centralized mechanisms do not block the display of all advertisements but prevent targeted/behavioral advertising adapted to the interests of the user, which are defined through their activity on the internet and their browsing history.
For example, the website youronlinechoices.com lists a large number of companies that work with websites to collect and use the information necessary for targeted/behavioral advertising. This website is offered by digital advertising professionals grouped together in the EDAA (European Digital Advertising Alliance) and managed in France by the Interactive Advertising Bureau France. This European platform is shared by hundreds of online advertising professionals and constitutes a centralized interface that allows the user to find out which companies are registered on the platform and offer the option of refusing or accepting the display of targeted/behavioral advertising on the user’s terminal with regard to their browsing information:
http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies
.
You can thus control and define your preferences with regard to targeted/behavioral advertising on this website by selecting or deselecting all companies, or by defining your preferences company by company, bearing in mind that you will have to follow the same process on each different browser that you may use.
For another example, a similar platform published by the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) is available on the page
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1
and also offers the same functions.
Although these platforms can allow you to manage your preferences regarding targeted advertising, they do not necessarily block advertising in general nor the installation of all cookies.
As a result, it is recommended that you use our cookie management module (see above) to manage your choices with regard to cookies.
Use of third-party tools available online
Certain publishers of the cookies that we use on our Site and on our mobile game applications offer dedicated deactivation modules. It is thus recommended that users familiarize themselves with the information pages listed in the table above (
see the details of the cookies we use in Paragraph 3
) in order to identify these modules if required.
For example, users can familiarize themselves with specific information regarding the Google Analytics deactivation module on the page:
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=fr&ref_topic=2919631
. The user can also choose to deactivate all Google Analytics cookies directly by visiting the following page:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
3.5     You can obtain information on how to control your data while browsing the internet on the website of the French agency on data protection, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or CNIL (
https://www.cnil.fr/fr/maitriser-mes-donnees
, particularly
https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-les-outils-pour-les-maitriser
). In this regard, third-party cookies are not normally necessary for you to enjoy the resources available on the internet. If you wish to limit your digital footprint, you are advised to refuse them by default, as recommended by CNIL.
How does TAPNATION process your personal data?
Cookies do not in and of themselves constitute personal data. However, they may effect the collection of information that can be qualified as personal data and therefore lead to the processing of such data.
In this regard, you are hereby informed that, by consenting to the installation of all or part of the cookies, you consent to the processing of your personal data collected in this way for the relevant purposes, it being understood that this processing may involve the processing, combining and cross-referencing of a significant volume of such data about you from various sources.
Subscriptions
Subscription-based billing is applied to some parts of the Service. Subscription provides access to dynamic content or services from within the Game on an ongoing basis.
Subscriptions may be available at different fees chargeable for a set period of time specified in the Game (“Subscription Period”). Payment will be taken from Your iTunes or Google Play account (“Account”) when You confirm the Subscription by available confirmation tools of the Game.
Trial Subscription is offered free of charge for certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant offer in the Game. If You do not cancel the Subscription within such period, Subscription Fee shall be taken from Your Account when the trial period expires. Please note that Your Subscription begins immediately after the activation of a trial Subscription, not after the seven-days trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the Subscription setting of Your Account. Tap Nation can not cancel your free-trial subscription if it has already been activated.
Subscription is automatically renewable, unless You turn off it at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription. Subscription Fee shall be taken from Your Account during 24 hours preceding the expiry of the current Subscription. In case Subscription Fee cannot be taken from Your Account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reasons, Your Subscription is automatically canceled.
Once You have bought a Subscription, You can manage it and switch off automatic renewal at any time after the purchase in Your Account setting. You cannot cancel Your current Subscription if it has already been activated.
Except when required by law, paid Subscription Fees are non-refundable.
Tap Nation in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the Subscription Fee. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the current Subscription period. You will be provided a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fee. If You do not take action to agree to the increase in Subscription Fee, Your Subscription shall expire at the end of the current Subscription period.
For all information regarding the processing of your personal data by TAPNATION, particularly the processing of personal data obtained via the cookies integrated into our Site and/or our mobile game applications, we ask you to consult our

Personal Data we collect
The type of Personal Data we collect about you will depend on our relationship with you. For the type of Personal Data we collect, see the table below in the section entitled ‘Purposes for which we use personal data and the legal bases’.
How we collect your Personal Data
We collect most of the Personal Data directly from you in person, by telephone, text or email and/or via our website.

:
Purpose
Lawful Basis for Processing

It is in our legitimate interest to respond to enquiries made via our website, by email, through our social channels or any other means.
Sending you information on sales events or product information which may be of interest
If you are an existing customer or have expressed an interest in our products or services, we will rely on legitimate interests to contact you for marketing purposes.
You may object to the processing for this purpose by emailing privacy@gameanalytics.com. If we have captured your consent for the purposes of marketing, that consent may be withdrawn at any time by emailing privacy@gameanalytics.com or using the unsubscribe option.

We have taken appropriate steps to ensure that any Personal Data being processed internationally, still has an equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed in the EU/UK. We do this by ensuring that:
Your Personal Data is only processed in a country which the Secretary of State has confirmed has an adequate level of protection (an adequacy regulation) or

How long we keep your data
We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide you with our services and for a reasonable period thereafter to enable us to meet our contractual and legal obligations and to deal with complaints and claims.
At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be securely deleted or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data, so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.
How we protect your data
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls

For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Retaining your information

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically

Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.

And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers

servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements

is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can

about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more

advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.

For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.

safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

at any time. Users and Testers may delete their respective accounts through their account settings. After account deletion, We may retain Personal Data (in part or in whole) associated with the Customer, User or Tester to meet any regulatory and reporting requirements for the timeframes stipulated by law and to be able to address customer service issues. Any other Personal Data We were processing relating to Our Customer, Tester and/or Users of that Hotjar account will be deleted permanently within thirty (30) calendar days. This does not apply to any Personal Data collected as part of Customer research within the Engage Product. To maintian the quality of the research data, any research-related Personal Data may need to be kept for a reasonably required time.
We may use Personal Data and other Data about Our Customers, Users and/or Testers (including but not limited to demographic information, location information, information about the computer or device from which they access Our Platform) to create, wherever possible, anonymized and aggregated information and analytics. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
The information We collect from Our Customers, Users and/or Testers is disclosed only in accordance with the Agreement and the Applicable Law.
Personal Data collected from Engage Product Testers
THIS SECTION APPLIES ONLY TO THE REGISTERED TESTERS OF OUR ENGAGE PRODUCT
When a Tester signs up to the Engage Product, we will ask them to share some Personal Data with Us to create a Tester profile. The Tester profile information will be revealed to Hotjar and Our Customers, who may invite you to usability study interviews ("
Interviews
"). The Engage Product has been built to connect Testers with the best-matched Customers for their Interviews. Better matches means happier Customers and more payouts for Testers. We analyse the data Testers provide Us with, along with the information about the Tester’s use of Our Platform, to suggest a good Interview match.
We collect and process Tester Personal Data to allow Testers to participate in Customer research, as well as for database management, managing contacts and sending messages, analytics, managing Our hosting and backend infrastructure, paying Testers for their service, Tester registration and authentication and displaying content from external platforms.
The data categories we will ask Testers to provide in order to build the Tester profile may include but are not limited to, name, age, country of residence, educational background, profession, marital status, phone number and other registration information. This information allows us to effectively match Testers with the right Customers. Testers may also optionally upload an avatar or enter their gender, but can remove this at any time. If a Tester deletes their account, their profile data will be removed too. Depending on the context, the legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We will also collect information that relates to how Testers use Our Platform. The categories of Personal Data relating to this include but are not limited to timezone, broad location (town or district), web browser, operating system and the device used, referral sources, email engagement data, data on how you use the Engage Product (including last login date and frequency) and account signup date. This information allows Us to personalize the Engage Product to Testers’ needs and to improve Our Engage Product. We do not collect precise, real-time information about the location of a Tester’s device. We delete (or anonymize) such Tester Personal Data as soon as you cancel your account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
On an entirely voluntary basis, Testers may choose to connect their social media account with their Tester profile. This will grant Us read-only access to their social media account and we will store their social media account ID, along with a secure 'access key' that these social media companies provide to Us. If Tester grants Us access, we may also process their email address that is associated with the social media account, name, profile picture, gender and age range, which we may use to enhance Tester profile data on the Engage Product. We use social media account data as a 'quality signal' to confirm that the Engage Product account belongs to a real person and therefore, sharing of social account data may affect the number of Interview invitations a Tester receives. We will never post content to a Tester’s social profile without their permission and we will never request or access their private messages on these accounts. Testers can choose to disconnect their social media accounts at any time, which will prevent Us from being able to access them. Social media account data will also be deleted if you choose to delete your Hotjar account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
In order to be able to remunerate Our Testers we will process payment related information that Testers share with Us such as PayPal email address, residential address, etc.. We may also need to keep a history of payments made to Testers. This is needed to comply with accounting and legal rules. This data may be kept up to seven (7) years. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Hotjar’s use of Personal Data
Access and Disclosure to Third Parties
We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain technical data analysis, processing and/or storage offerings (e.g., IT and related services). These Third Party service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection and security standards. We only share data with them that is required for the services offered and We contractually bind them to keep any information We share with them as confidential and to process Personal Data only according to Our instructions. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
In addition to services providers, other categories of Third Parties may include:
Vendors/public institutions.
To the extent that this is necessary in order to make use of certain services requiring special expertise (such as legal, accounting or auditing services) We may share Personal Data with vendors of such services or public institutions that offer them (e.g. courts). The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.
If We are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then Data may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Other than the cases mentioned above, We will only transfer Personal Data to Third Parties without express consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or if We are obliged to do so by statutory law or by instruction from a public authority or court as outlined in Our
Terms of Service

Communication Purposes
We may occasionally send notification emails about updates to Our product, legal documents, customer support or for marketing purposes. To the extent required by Applicable Law, We will only send such messages if We have obtained consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In all other cases, the legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Except for cases where We are required to do so by law (e.g. notification of a data breach, providing you with important information about your account, updating our legal documents, etc.), recipients of Our communication shall have the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving these messages free of charge. We process requests to be placed on do-not-contact lists as required by Applicable Law.
Marketing Purposes
We use Personal Data given to Us by Hotjar’s Customers, Users, Testers and/or visitors to Our Site to target advertisements to:
Hotjar’s Customers, Users, Testers and/or visitors to Our Site to keep them informed about Hotjar and any product changes we make; and
Potential new Customers or Testers that appear to have shared interests or similar demographics.
The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We do this by sharing Personal Data with Third Party marketing platforms that have high privacy and confidentiality standards and which have gone through a legal and security review by Hotjar. This ensures that these Third Parties cannot do anything with the Personal Data We provide them other than use it for the express purpose of providing Us with the marketing services We contract them for.
This Personal Data is only shared with these Third Parties through secure and encrypted means. If you wish to opt out of this processing activity, please contact Us at
dpo@hotjar.com
with the subject line “Opt-Out of Marketing”.

Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, please review our
California Resident Privacy Notice
("CCPA") for information regarding your California privacy rights.
Transfer to Third Countries
If personal data is being transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, we only transfer it to third countries where the EU Commission has confirmed an adequate level of protection or where we can ensure the careful handling of personal data by means of contractual agreements (Standard Contract Clauses) or other suitable guarantees, such as certifications or proven compliance with international security standards. Information on this is available from us upon request.
Data Privacy Framework
Adjust Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Adjust Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, Adjust Inc. commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF should first contact Adjust Inc. at:
privacy@adjust.com
If you are an EU individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see below) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Choice: If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Policy, Adjust will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Data should be sent to us at
privacy@adjust.com
2. Tracking Technologies on our Website
Google Analytics
We use the Google Analytics service of the provider Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland on our website.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service that allows us to collect and analyze data about the behavior of visitors to our website. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose, which enable an analysis of the use of our website. This involves processing of personal data in the form of online identifiers (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers and information about interaction with our website.
Some of this data is information that is stored in the terminal device you are using. In addition, further information is also stored on your end device via the cookies used. Such storage of information by Google Analytics or access to information that is already stored in your terminal device only takes place with your consent.
Google Ireland will process the data collected in this way on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website by the users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our website and the use of the internet. In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
The personal data processed on our behalf to provide Google Analytics may be transferred to any country in which Google Ireland or Google Ireland's sub-processors maintain facilities. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries".
In addition to the option to reject Google Analytics in our Consent Banner, you can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
.
We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google Ireland within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the IP address be transferred to Google on a server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other data. You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
We use the Google Analytics 4 variant, which allows us to track interaction data from different devices and from different sessions. This allows us to put individual user actions in context and analyze long-term relationships.
The data about user actions are stored for a period of 14 months and then automatically deleted. All other event data is stored for 2 months and are then automatically deleted. Thereby, the deletion of the data whose storage period has expired takes place automatically once a month.

We use the online advertising program Google Ads of Google Ireland, Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) on our website, through which we place advertisements on the Google search engine. When you access our website via a Google ad, Google sets a cookie on your terminal device ("conversion cookie"). In the process, a different conversion cookie is assigned to each Google Ads customer, so that the cookies are not tracked across the websites of different Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our Google ads. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. When using the service, a transfer of your data to the USA cannot be excluded. Please note the information in the section "Data transfer to third countries". You can find Google's privacy policy here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
.
Google Remarketing
We also use the Google Analytics advertising features (remarketing) from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This function enables us, in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google, to display advertisements in a more targeted manner and to present users with ads that are tailored to their interests. Via the remarketing, users are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network. The function allows us to link advertising target groups created via Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google Ads. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to a user depending on previous usage and surfing behavior on an end device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another end device of the user (e.g. tablet or PC).
If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be placed on every end device on which you log in with your Google account. The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or withdraw at Google. For these linked services, data is then collected via Google Analytics for advertising purposes. To support the remarketing function, Google Analytics collects users' Google-authenticated IDs, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data. This is used to define and create target groups for cross-device ad advertising.

Google Signals
We use the Signals feature of Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Signals recognises individual users using different devices (so-called cross-device tracking). We only receive anonymous data in the form of a report that shows patterns in user behaviour. Google Signals helps us to better understand how visitors interact with our website and to show more meaningful and personalized ads to these visitors after leaving our website.
For this, session data is being processed and linked with website visitors that
• have a Google account;
• are logged in to their Google account when they access the corresponding website; and
• have turned on the “Ads personalization” feature in their Google account.

Advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party service provider on behalf of such advertiser) may also share transactional or “event” data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations.
Information Collection and Use Specific
to
e-Commerce Ads Only
If you are a consumer who interacts with the Services through an e-commerce platform or a merchant website, we may collect certain additional information (that you provided to the e-commerce platform or merchant, through a third party’s API, our SDK, pixel, or other similar technologies), including the following:
User IDs;
Shopping browsing behavior (e.g., views) and search history;
Records of products purchased or considered (e.g., added to cart, check out);
Purchasing histories; and

How We Collect Your Information
This information may be collected automatically across mobile apps and devices or received from third-parties across different technologies over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we will use that combined information to offer the Services.
How We Use Your Information

Deliver the Services, maintain, and improve them, including our AI-powered advertising technology, and research and develop new ones;
Promote safety, security, and integrity of Services;
Provide measurement, analytics, and reporting; and
Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
We use AI-powered advertising technology (sometimes referred to as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our advertising products and Services and serve ads that are relevant and interesting to you. We use it in ways that do not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you (for example, by reordering how advertisements might appear when you visit a digital property such as a mobile app or a website).
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties in the following contexts:
Service Providers.
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
Affiliates.
We may share information within the AppLovin family of companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Advertising Partners.
We share information with our third-party advertising partners, including advertisers, ad networks, exchanges, demand side platforms, merchants, other advertising partners (who aggregate their own demand sources), and ad optimization and measurement/attribution partners (e.g., mobile measurement partners or “MMPs”) to provide our clients with Advertising Services. This information may be used by such third-party partners to measure how effective ads are, show advertisements to end users for products and services that are more likely to appeal to them (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other ad activity to improve the advertising experience.
Unless otherwise noted in our partner list, each AppLovin advertising partner is an independent controller of your data. You can view a list of AppLovin advertising partners with whom we share your data
here

“Additional Provisions for EU/UK/Swiss Individuals”
section below for more options. If you are an individual resident of the U.S. states that have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws, you may also review the “
U.S. Multistate Privacy Notice
” section below for more options.
Please note that the practices of our third-party advertising partners delivering advertisements through our Services are subject to those partners’ own privacy policies.
Regulatory or Legal Requirements.
We may disclose information to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation, when otherwise required by law or court order.
Safety and Terms Enforcement.
We may disclose information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that its disclosure is necessary to protect the health, safety, or rights of you or any other person, protect against fraud, or enforce our legal rights, including contractual commitments made to us by third parties.
Business Transfers.
We may disclose personal information as part of an organizational business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, financing, or sale of organizational assets and may transfer personal information to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. We may also disclose personal information in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.

dataprotection@applovin.com
.

AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  AppLovin has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
If you are an EU, UK, or Swiss individual, where we transfer your personal data to third party servicer providers (see above) who perform services for us or on our behalf, we are responsible for the processing of that data by them and shall remain liable if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, AppLovin may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If the processing of your personal data is necessary, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you if there is no other lawful basis for such processing. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
(e) Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
We hope that you find the display of interest-based Ads valuable. However, if you wish to opt-out of these advertising services, you can edit your preferences by visiting the “Settings” page of the Website and selecting the option to opt-out.
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your Devices or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile Devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their Device settings or by downloading the AppChoices mobile application offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at
optout.networkadvertising.org
, or
youronlinechoices.eu
and
optout.aboutads.info
. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics by following this link:
tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out found at
bidmachine.io/sdk-opt-out/
and/or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each Device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile Device. You must separately opt-out on each Device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
7. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse, such as using SSL encryption. However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. While we take meaningful steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain secure. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

How Criteo services work across environments
Your rights
Our partners
CCPA Privacy Policy
Welcome! This is where you can learn about Criteo, the technologies and services we offer to our partners, and our data collection and privacy policies.
Disable Criteo services
Our activity
Criteo helps brands, e-commerce sites and other advertisers (“Advertisers”) promote their products and services. We do that by enabling Advertisers to tailor their campaigns and/or offers to audiences that they want to reach with content that they wish to promote, which in turns means that you may receive advertising that may be of interest to you on the websites, mobile applications and other platforms of our partners (the “Publishers” or “Partners”).
How do our services work?
Criteo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.
When you browse an Advertiser’s website or mobile application that uses our technologies, that technology allows us to collect a limited amount of data relating to your browsing, such as the products you have viewed, put in your shopping cart and purchased.
Find out more about the type of data collected by Criteo
. This navigation data is linked to a unique identifier, namely an identification cookie or any other similar technology (such as mobile advertising identifiers and non-cookie technologies) depending on your navigation environment.
When you browse a Publisher’s website or mobile application that also uses our technologies, the Publisher notifies us, either directly or through an advertiser exchange, that an advertising space is available to offer you personalized advertising. The Criteo technology, working with our Advertisers, then may decide to purchase that advertising space.
The advertising you see from our partners when using our technology is based on our recommendation algorithms.
Practical example
Here is one way our technology allows us to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you:
When users visit an Advertiser website using our technologies, data relating to their browsing events are collected.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
The user with the cookie identifier 123f94d8-a745-4f8b-a1d0-bf6fbbd60058 (let’s name it “Criteo ID 123” for convenience) viewed product A on 01/01/2018 at 13:37 while browsing www.example-advertiser.com.
Our technologies compare these data with the aggregated data available on the Advertiser’s website.
Example of aggregated data available:
In general, users who purchased Product A on www.example-advertiser.com also purchased Product B on this website
In general, Product C is popular on this website
When users browse a Publisher website, we are informed of the availability of advertising spaces.
Example of data collected by Criteo:
An advertising space with the following characteristics (size, visibility, etc.) is available on www.example-publisher.com that the Criteo ID 123 is about to browse
Then our algorithms determine the relevance for buying the advertising space and displaying a personalized ad on it.
Example of decision that would be taken by Criteo: Buy the advertising space available on www.example-publisher.com and display an ad featuring the following products:
Product A, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 showed interest in it during a recent session
Product B, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 is likely to be interested in this product since he/she has viewed product A during a recent session
Product C, because this product is popular.
If you disable Criteo services, we will not display any personalized ads to you. On the other hand, the advertising space may be purchased by another company to display personalized or non-personalized ads. If you want to disable Criteo services,

.
Please note that the use of our technologies on our partners’ websites and mobile applications is governed by their privacy policies, which can be accessed directly from their websites and/or mobile applications. We require them to provide you with complete and appropriate information and, to the extent required by law, to obtain your consent before any of your personal information is available to us.
Our technologies are able to work in a similar fashion:
on a webpage by relying on cookies, which are supported by most web browsers;
on a mobile application by relying on the mobile advertising ID provided by mobile operating system vendors (e. g. Google and Apple);
on an browser which default settings limit the use of third-party cookies and inter-site tracking, such as Safari, if you provide consent for our services to co-exist with these default settings;
and in a transversal way between the different environments listed above. Find out more about
how our services work from one environment to another (“cross-device linking”)
.
In order to provide you with ads that are better tailored to your interests, we may receive and process audience and segments information derived from the data you accepted to share with trusted third party partners. These partners may send us information regarding your shopping habits (e.g. interested in clothing, furniture or electronics), the points of interest that are near you based on non-precise geolocation information (e.g. stores that are geographically close to you) or the products you have been purchasing in a brick and mortar store of the advertisers that are using our services to manage their online marketing campaigns. In such case, Criteo will only process geolocation information and identifiers (such as cookie IDs and Mobile Advertising IDs) that do not allow us to know who you are.
We believe that the personalization of ads is beneficial to you and the Internet ecosystem in that it contributes to the promotion of a free and open Internet by allowing Publishers to monetize the content they create, while allowing you to benefit from ads that may be more interesting to you than non-personalized ads that would be displayed to you.
Our privacy pillars
We have developed our services and technologies taking great care to respect your privacy.
Data minimisation
We undertake never to use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc. Without ever being able to identify you personally, our technologies are able to recognize your devices and/or browsers on the basis of an identifier consisting of a series of characters (identifier contained in a cookie or other). However, these data are qualified as personal data by European regulations and personal information by Californian law. As such, they are the subject of our greatest vigilance in terms of security and respect for your privacy.
Privacy by design
Our product teams develop every feature with privacy in mind; it’s the cornerstone of Privacy by Design, Criteo’s long-standing practice and commitment to ensuring industry-leading privacy, security and safety for consumers and marketers.
Key elements include:
As required by the GDPR, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer since 2013 along with a team of privacy experts.
These experts sit within the Product and R&D organization. They perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks.
The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces codes of conduct, and is integral to ensuring that we build best-in-class products and services.
We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary, and enforce these policies with our partners and vendors.
Criteo's commitments
Our ads do not require:
To collect data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, your postal address, or your email address in plain text.
To collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health or sexual orientation …) to create segments or target ads to users. For the sole purpose of serving ads on a Publisher’s properties that could possibly reveal sensitive information (eg. a medical website), we may collect the URL of the website or the name of the mobile application.
To collect irrevocable identifiers, such as the hardware identifiers of the devices you use (UDID or MAC address, etc.).
To collect data related to your precise geolocation in real time.

to include on their websites and mobile applications the appropriate notice and information, allowing users to know more about our services and to object to them through this notice; and
to collect the consent of users prior to the placement of cookies or any similar technology for the purpose of displaying personalized advertisements.
In order to help our partners meet their legal and contractual obligations, we regularly share industry best practices with them.
Google’s Privacy Sandbox
We participate in testing the Google Privacy Sandbox, a set of technologies to enable digital advertising without using third-party cookies in Google Chrome. With your consent, and as part of the testing, Criteo may store and access data on your device or browser, including by setting new cookies, that
relates to your web browsing interests and to ad measurement. In accordance with applicable data protection laws, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time on this

Privacy Policy
Jun Group Productions, LLC
HyprMX Mobile LLC
Effective: September 16, 2020
Introduction
At Jun Group Productions, LLC and our HyprMX Mobile LLC subsidiary, we connect advertisers and publishers that we call clients to an audience of end users that we call consumers. Consumers are end users of applications and websites that we call properties, and those properties are owned by third parties that we call partners. Our services enable clients to deliver targeted, interactive content that we call engagements to consumers, and in doing so, we collect information about consumers and partners. We also collect information from visitors to our websites,
www.jungroup.com
and
www.hyprmx.com
.
This privacy policy describes how we collect, retain, use and disclose information that you make available to us as a user of our services, including as a visitor to our websites, as a consumer end user of our partners' properties, and/or as one of our partners. Information may include personal information that directly identifies a specific person, such as a full name or email address, as well as other types of information, such as your interests, service usage and Internet access device characteristics. This privacy policy applies whenever you use our websites or services, including if you have registered an account with us.

‍
Information Collection
We and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:
We may collect the following information from and about you:
1.        Registration and survey information, consisting of information you choose to submit through our services, for example, to receive a newsletter, answer survey questions or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration information may include, for example, name, picture, email address, gender, zip or postal code and birthday.
2.        Activity and device information, consisting of data we may collect when you access our services. For example, we collect information about your computer or other Internet access device, your operating system and browser or other Internet enabled application, your IP address (which may be associated with your location) and information about what ads or other engagements you have viewed and interacted with. If you access our services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (e.g., Apple's IDFA or Google's GAID), geolocation data (if you have consented to provide this through your mobile or other device), wireless service provider and other transactional information for that device.
3.        Information from other sources. We may supplement or ask our third party service providers to supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our affiliates or business partners. This enables us to tailor our services to your interests or to report to our clients on the effectiveness of engagements or the extent to which you belong to certain interest segments, and we source data only from sources that are lawfully entitled to share information with us.
Information Use and Disclosure
‍
We use and disclose information about you for the purposes listed below:
‍
1.        To deliver our services to you and others, to measure, manage, support and improve our services, and to allow service providers to assist us in performing our services. We may make any of the personal information listed above available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide our services. For example, we use services from Amazon and Google to support our technology infrastructure, and third parties also facilitate creating, serving and measuring engagements and tracking service usage.
2.        To deliver relevant engagements and conduct research. We use the information we collect from and about you to deliver relevant ads and other engagements to you and others when you use our services or another service. For example, our services are embedded in our partners' properties, and we deliver our clients' engagements to you when you access those properties. We also use your information to conduct or to enable others to conduct research e.g., about consumer trends, sentiments, the effectiveness of advertising or the extent to which you and others may belong to certain interest segments. This includes incorporating information we collect about you into statistical “lookalike models” that enable us to infer the preferences of other consumers and deliver more relevant advertising to them. We do not use directly identifying personal information about you (such as your name and contact details) to deliver relevant engagements to you or to conduct research without your opt-in consent. As noted above, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties, and those other sources may assist us in delivering relevant engagements to you based on directly identifying personal information about you that they can access, even if they do not provide such information to us in doing so. For example, a retailer may transfer your purchase history and email address to a third party that may combine that information with other information, enabling an advertiser to instruct us to deliver relevant ads to your device by targeting your device identifier.
3.        To contact you. We may send you promotional materials or notifications related to our services. If you want to stop receiving them, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. Note that if you opt-out of promotional materials and notifications, you will still receive service-related notifications and emails, such as notifications of changes to our services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, change the settings either in your mobile device notification setting or through the app.
4.        To share with our affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates for the purposes described in this privacy policy. As of the effective date posted above, our affiliates consist of Jun Group Productions, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary HyprMX Mobile LLC, and APG (Advantage Performace Group). Our affiliates will only use your information in a way that is consistent with the practices described in this privacy policy.
5.        To share with business partners. We may share your information with business partners (e.g., clients) for their own business purposes, including to advertise to you and to send you marketing communications. If that information includes directly identifying personal information, we will only do so with your consent. If you are a California resident, you have the right to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.
6.        To protect our rights and those of others. We may disclose your information if we have a good faith belief it is necessary in order to: (i) investigate, protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, privacy, safety, or property and that of others (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of our services users or the public; (iii) protect against fraud or manage risk; (iv) comply with the law or participate in any legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.
7.        To complete a merger or sale of assets. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction. In such an event, we will inform the acquiring party of the need to protect your information in accordance with this privacy policy.
8.        In any other manner that you authorize us with your informed, affirmative consent.
Cookies
We refer to browser cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash cookies as cookies. For more information about cookies, including how you can change your cookie settings, please see our Cookie Statement at
hyprmx.com/cookie.html
or
jungroup.com/JG-CookieStatement.html
. At this time, we do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.
Interest-Based Advertising
Interest-based advertising refers to using information collected across non-affiliated, third-party sites and applications over time to provide more relevant advertising to you, based on your interests inferred from that information. The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) is a coalition of digital advertising companies that has created a self-regulatory code for interest based advertising, and we comply with those
self-regulatory principles.
Consumers may opt out of receiving interest-based ads in our services for mobile applications by following these steps:
1.        For iOS devices running iOS 8 through iOS 13, go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. For iOS devices running iOS 14, go to Settings > Privacy > Tracking, and disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track." Our services do not support earlier versions of iOS. Additional instructions are available on
Apple’s support site
.
2.        For Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 and higher, go to Google Settings App > Ads > Enable "Opt out of interest-based advertising" or go to Settings > Google > Personal info & Privacy > Ads Settings > Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization," and in either case, and also click “Reset advertising ID.”
We may serve ads to you on one device based on information we learn about you on another device, and opting out of interest-based advertising is only effective for the device on which you followed the steps above.
Repeat these steps to opt out on other devices as desired. If you opt out, you will still see ads that will not be interest-based ads.Instead, they may be untargeted, related to the context of the property you are using, or based on information you volunteer to us in the property in which the ad is shown, such as responses to survey questions. You can opt out of a survey by, as applicable, clicking the [x] button to close the survey or selecting “I prefer not to answer” instead of answering the question. We do not engage in interest-based advertising in desktop or mobile web browsers even when we display the DAA AdChoices logo, so no opt-out choices apply in those environments.
Health and Other Sensitive Information
We ask that you not send us, and that you do not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through our services unless we specifically request it from you and you opt in to providing such disclosure for specific purposes we explain at that time.
We may deliver ads to you about non-sensitive health topics based on first- and third-party data. In all geographies, we may deliver ads to you about sensitive health topics either based on the context of the property on which the ad is being served (i.e. an ad that is not targeted based on information about you) or with your opt-in permission. We use custom rather than standard segments for delivering health-related ads, for example "asthma sufferers" and "migraine sufferers." If we survey you about health topics, we may use your responses to deliver relevant ads and/or to allow third parties to provide relevant ads. If we survey you about sensitive health topics, we will ask you to provide us with your voluntary, affirmative consent to use your responses in this manner. If you opt into a health survey, we will continue to respect any interest-based advertising opt-out you set for your device as described above under Interest-Based Advertising.
We do not use or allow others to use sensitive information to determine eligibility for health insurance, health care treatment eligibility, life insurance, or employment.
Children's Privacy
Our services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA. We do not knowingly create or use audience segments of children less than 13 years of age.
Our partners and clients are responsible for their own compliance with COPPA and similar data protection laws. If you believe your child has provided us with information covered by COPPA or another similar data protection law, please contact us at the address below and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the applicable information from our records.
Security
We use reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures intended to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Please note that no method of online information storage or transmission is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee information security.
Access, Control and Other Rights
If you would like to exercise your rights under applicable data protection laws to request access to, or correction, erasure, restriction or portability of your personal information, then please contact us as provided below. You may object to our processing of your personal information by contacting us using these details.
To help us most efficiently manage your request, please include your name and contact details and, if possible, identify the information to which your request relates. We will comply with your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
In particular, your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes include:
1.        Receiving electronic communications from us: If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email. We will process your request promptly following receipt.
2.        Cancelling your account. If you are our partner, you may cancel your account by emailing privacy@hyprmx.com, subject, "Delete My Account" and include the email address that you registered your account with (if different from the email address you're sending the email from). We may retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.
If you have given us consent to use your personal information for any purpose, you may withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the validity of any uses of your personal information prior to withdrawal.
Location of Data Processing
Our services are managed and primarily hosted from the United States. We and our service providers may process your information in the United States, as well as in other countries where our service providers operate. These countries may have different data protection standards to those in your jurisdiction, and we will protect your information in accordance with this privacy policy at all times.
Third Parties and Linked Services
Our services may link to or be integrated with properties operated by third parties, and may carry ads or other engagements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests, sweepstakes or applications developed and maintained by such unaffiliated companies. For example, our services for partners include an "advertisement mediation" service that allows ads from our clients to be served to consumers alongside ads from third party ad networks included in our partners' properties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, and once you leave our services or click an engagement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service. To determine which ad networks are serving ads via our mediation service, please contact our partner who owns or operates the applicable property (i.e. contact the mobile application developer directly).
Data Retention
We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, provided that we will not retain your information in our production systems for more than thirty months from the date you last interacted with one of our properties, unless a longer retention period is required by law. We may retain backup information on our servers for up to three years for fraud detection, to enforce our legal rights, or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
Even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable, for example, if you have shared information with social media or other services.
Privacy Policy Updates
We may modify this privacy policy from time to time due to evolving legal, operational or business requirements. When we do, we will post an updated copy on our website, indicating that it has been updated. Please look at the posted date at the top of this privacy policy to see when we last revised it. Any changes to this privacy policy will ordinarily become effective when we post the revised privacy policy on our services, provided that, if we make material changes to this privacy policy, the revised privacy policy will not become effective until at least 15 days after we post it to our services. We will also notify our service users for whom we have contact email addresses of any such material changes and, where required by law, obtain their consent.

About Us
ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 4 main services:
Ad Network
– A platform that allows app developers to serve ads within their apps, and advertisers to promote their products, and services within apps.
Mediation Platform
– A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, “third party” ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.
Analytics Platform –
A platform that allows app developers to receive insights on their apps.
Ad Quality Platform
–
A platform that allows app developers to monitor advertising content displayed within their apps.
In addition, as of November 2022, Unity Technologies has been added as a corporate affiliate of ironSource Mobile Ltd. To view Unity’s privacy policy, please click
here
We collect information in either of 2 ways:
Directly
– through our SDKs integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from such apps.
Indirectly
– through other third party mediation platforms with which we engage in order to serve ads in apps, or by receiving information from our advertisers, or affiliates.
Scope:
This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its Ad Network, Mediation Platform, Analytics Platform and Ad Quality Platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.
ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connetecuit and Utah, please see “State Privacy Rights” section of this privacy policy for information related to privacy laws in these states.
Information We Collect:
Information collected through our Ad Network (“Ad Network Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, and a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”), or . The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize a device across apps, for advertising purposes. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of the Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.
General technical information about a device: Technical information such as the device’s time zone, the amount of free memory on the device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status, operating system name and version,  the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi), etc.
Campaign information: An indication if an ad was viewed, or clicked, or if there was an install of an advertised app. Information about actions performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, and level in the game (if the advertiser chooses to provide such information).
Information collected through our Mediation Platform (“Mediation Information”)
–
Identifiers: Advertising ID, IP address, a self-created ID unique to a specific app, and IDs unique only to apps of the same developer.
General technical information as described above.
Data provided by the app developers (if they choose to provide it) – The app developer can choose to share with us the following information: age, gender, in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information provided by the app developer.
Information collected by our Analytics Platform (“Analytics Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
App events: Events set by the app developer that occurred within the app.
General technical data about the device.
Information collected by our Ad Quality Platform (“Ad Quality Information”)
Identifiers: a self-created ID unique to a specific app.
Advertising content: The ads displayed within the app, and interactions with such ads.
General technical data about the device.
How We Use the Information We Collect:
As stated above, we provide 4 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use information across our services:
Operating our Ad Network
– We use Ad Network Information to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Ad delivery: we use Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.
Reporting, billing and attribution: We use Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Fraud detection and prevention: We use Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.
Optimization and frequency capping: We use Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.
Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in, or from their advertising campaigns.
Operating our ad marketplace. We use Ad Network Information to allow the third party advertising companies listed
here
to bid on ad inventory.
Operating our Mediation Platform
– We use Mediation Information to operate our mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.
Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.
Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.
Operating our Analytics Platform
– We use Analytics Information to operate our Analytics Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Analytics Platform in order to allow them to better understand the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Analytics Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.
Operating our Ad Quality Platform
– We use Ad Quality Information to operate our Ad Quality Platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:
Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our Ad Quality Platform in order to allow them to see which ads were served within their apps, and how such ads affected the use of their apps.
Internal Operations: We use Ad Quality for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.

8.
Your Opt-Out Choices
MobileFuse does not sell or share the personal information we collect and use as a controller, but our Clients may use our technology to sell or share personal information for targeted or personalized advertising.
There are several ways to opt out of receiving targeted advertising our clients may initiate using our technology. Note that different devices use different identifiers and different technologies, so that you must opt out separately from each browser and each device that you would like to be opted out. If you opt out of targeted advertising, we will no longer collect User Information described above from the opted-out device.
Device-Based.
Your device should give you the ability to opt-out of the use of information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests (see “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” under your settings menu on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” under your settings menu on iOS devices).
App-Based.
You may stop the collection of location information by particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. For more information on how to change your preferences, please see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice
.
Submission-Based.
When we are acting as a data processor for our Clients, our Clients are responsible for satisfying disclosure and consent requirements under applicable data protection laws. However, if you want to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information for interested-based advertising, we can assist you. Please follow the steps below.
Step 1: Locate Your Digital Identifiers
For us to locate relevant records, we will need you to provide us with your digital identifiers. You can find your digital identifiers as follows:
Mobile Devices and other Internet Connected Devices
Certain mobile devices (for example, mobile phones or tablets using the iOS or Android operating systems) generate a persistent “Advertising Identifier” per device, which, among other things, can be used by third parties, like MobileFuse, for purposes of providing you with targeted advertising.
On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “IDFA,” “IFA,” or an “ID for Advertising.” On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “Advertising ID.” Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifier.  The following link may also help you
http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice
.
Step 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers
To make sure that we are responding to the correct person, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that the devices that have the digital identifiers you located in Step 1 are yours and that the information you are requesting relates to you. For digital identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of the screen that displays the digital identifier.
We may also request that you respond to a few questions, so that we can appropriately verify your identity. Doing this helps us to validate that you have access to the device on which the digital identifiers have been placed (and that you are not an unauthorized third party attempting to “guess” digital identifiers).
Step 3: Submit to MobileFuse
Once you have located your digital identifiers and can provide us with verification (screenshots) of those digital identifiers, please contact us with details of the rights you wish to exercise. The easiest way to do so would be to submit the relevant information to our privacy email at
compliance@mobilefuse.com
. We request the following information:
Your full name.
The state and country in which you are located at the time you are making your request.
A clear statement indicating that you would like to opt out of interest-based advertising.
A full list of your digital identifiers with screenshots as set forth in Step 2 above.
9.
Children
Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16. If an individual is under the age of 16, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete that personal information.
10.
Information Retention and Security
We typically store the User Information we collect from your device, such as Unique Device ID, IP address and other information described above, in our systems for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports.
In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.
We use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems. Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.
11.
Third Party Websites and Services
Our website and the ads we service may contain links to other websites. You should be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites as those may have different privacy policies and terms of use and are not associated with us. You agree that we cannot control these links and we shall not be responsible for any use of such websites.
12.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may change our Privacy Policy at any time.

14. Contacting Us
Smaato, Inc. (“Smaato,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, and share information. This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers Smaato’s handling of two types of information:
Information we receive from our Clients about end users (“End Users”) of third-party mobile applications (“apps”) that use our Software Development Kit (“SDK”), other collection interfaces (collectively, “APIs”), the Smaato Demand Platform (“SDX”), or the Smaato Publisher Platform (“SPX”) (collectively, the “Smaato Ad Services”), and
Information we receive through our corporate website at www.smaato.com or any other website on which this Policy is posted, as well as information we get through other corporate services and web portals we make available to clients and business partners (“Smaato Websites”). We describe the information received through the Smaato Websites in Section 5 below, titled “Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites.”
We encourage consumers to learn about how information (including information we collect) can be used to market to them, and how to exercise their choices to permit or limit such marketing. We describe ways consumers can exercise that choice or opt-out of marketing in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
1. Introduction and Background
Smaato provides mobile advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among demand-side platforms, advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”), and service providers (collectively “Partners”). We do this by making available the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to Clients. Clients use the Smaato Ad Services and other tools to deliver advertising to End Users, and we in turn provide our services to help Clients (and their own customers) to deliver ads that are of interest to End Users. We explain what SDKs and APIs are in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs,” which also explains how cookies and similar technologies (which we also use to provide the Smaato Ad Services) work.
2. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Ad Services
a. Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
Through the Smaato Ad Services, we may collect information about End Users (to the extent that Clients pass such information to Smaato), which includes:
IP addresses, from which geographic location may be inferred, as well as system configuration information such as information about End Users’ operating system;
Rough geolocation information;
Cookie IDs, Mobile advertising identifiers, such as iOS IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs (collectively, “Mobile IDs”);
Age;
Gender;
Device type and other device information (e.g., whether an End User is using a smartphone or tablet, and related information);
Network provider;
Mobile browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, and Chrome); and
Other unique identifiers that may be associated with an End Users’ device, including identifiers provided by Clients or their service providers.
We refer to all of the above information as the “Service Information.”
b. How We Use the Information Collected Through the Smaato Ad Services
We use the Service Information to provide a variety of services to our Clients related to advertising and marketing, including services we may describe elsewhere on Smaato Websites. This includes use of the Service Information for purposes such as to:
Provide customer, technical, and operational support for the Smaato Ad Services, detect and protect against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity, and resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions and other rights we may have. This may also include analyzing, customizing, and improving the features of the Smaato Ad Services;
Provide information and analytics to Clients about the advertising inventory provided through the Smaato Ad Services;
We, or our Clients, may deploy online cookies to track End Users across mobile websites and/or apps, or to associate End Users and these cookies with Mobile IDs. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in Section 3 below, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.”
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Ad Services
We share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the Smaato Ad Services. For example, we share the Service Information with:
Clients and their marketing and service providers, so they may provide targeted advertising to End Users on mobile websites and/or apps;
Partners that facilitate the functioning of the Smaato Ad Services (e.g., traffic and ad quality verification vendors and data centers).
Even when a Client no longer accesses our SDK, we may continue to use and share Service Information as described in this Policy. The processes we described above often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions. This is generally known as “interest-based advertising.” We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options,” or go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA’s) website at www.aboutads.info. We may also share Service Information with third parties:
Pursuant to a request or authorization by an End User or Client;
If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity;
Where the information is aggregated or de-identified; and
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).
3. Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs
a. Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser. Our servers may deploy a cookie on your browser when you visit the Smaato Websites. Our Clients and Partners may do likewise on the Smaato Websites, our Clients’ and Partners’ websites, and elsewhere. Smaato may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to any given website. Using persistent cookies, a site operator (or a third party they work with) can “remember” what you have previously done on a website and personalize the site, or ads you see, for you. This technology may also provide a site operator or third party (or us, when you visit the Smaato Websites) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the Smaato Websites’ functionalities and offerings, and those of other websites you visit.
b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs
We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Smaato Ad Services and those using our Smaato Ad Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. Sometimes, we obtain data through other (generally, simpler) interfaces that deliver similar data to us, which are commonly referred to (and which we refer to) as APIs. We may use these technologies, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 4 below, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.”
4. Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options
In most cases, consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant ads and marketing emails from our Clients. To change the settings for the cookies Smaato sets on your devices through the Smaato Websites, please visit our Cookie Policy.
a. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising from Cookies
You can opt-out of many of the publishers, platforms and service providers we work with that support online interest-based advertising from cookies or similar technologies by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info (or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union). Some of our publisher Clients have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked from their websites or their online-posted privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of those companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a certain company, or multiple companies. You can also click below to opt-out of having the Smaato Ad services used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior. When you opt-out, an opt-out cookie (from smaato.net) will be stored in your web browser. Our platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt-out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using Smaato Ad services for online interest-based advertising from cookies. Please note: This type of opt-out is cookie-based, which means that if you block cookies, upgrade your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again. Also, in order for your opt-out choice to be effective, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the Smaato opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out. If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Even if you opt-out, Smaato may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still will receive advertising from the Smaato Ad Service when you visit websites of a publisher Client who uses our Platform – but such advertising will not be personalized to you.
b. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices
You can opt-out of having your Mobile IDs used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”), including those performed by Smaato, by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:
Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling “Limit Ad Tracking.”
iOS 7 and Higher: Go to Settings → Privacy → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
iOS 6: Go to Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggle “Limit Ad Tracking” to ‘ON.’
Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt-out of most cross-app advertising by going to Google Settings → Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.
Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change, and the precise language may be different on certain (particularly, on older) devices. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.
c. Additional Choices
Advertisers may also provide ways for you to opt-out from, or limit their collection of, certain information from and about you. Please refer to the privacy policies for retailers, apps, and mobile websites to learn more about their privacy practices. You may opt-out from receiving promotional emails from us, such as emails to inform you about events and new services, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any promotional email you receive, or by contacting us at
marketing@smaato.com
*protected email*
. Please note, however, that we may still send you non-promotional emails relating to your relationship with us.
5. Privacy Practices for the Smaato Websites
a. Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
The Smaato Websites provide information regarding Smaato and our products and services. Through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, and we may also obtain automatically-collected information.
i. Information You Disclose to Us
When registering for an account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Smaato or our products and services, or otherwise contacting us through the Smaato Websites, we collect the information you voluntarily disclose to us, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other billing information. You may also provide us with certain information about your business or other individuals.
ii. Automatically-Collected Information
When you visit the Smaato Websites, we may use cookies and pixel tags that we associate with unique identifiers to keep track of visitor interactions and personalize your experience on the Smaato Websites. For more information, please see Section 3 above, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags, and SDKs.” We may also use third-party services, such as Google Analytics, that gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the web page from which you came to the Smaato Websites, and the times of your visit. In addition, as you browse the Smaato Websites, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can “remember” your interests. Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the Smaato Websites. To opt-out of such interest-based mobile advertising, please see Section 4 above, titled “Consumer Control and Opt-Out Options.” Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you.
b. How We Use Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
In addition to the uses described elsewhere in this Policy, we use the information we collect through the Smaato Websites (alone or in combination) to provide, market, improve, and operate the Smaato Websites, Smaato Ad Services, and any other products or services we have or may develop. This includes use of the information to:
Fulfill your requests;
Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications;
Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;
Create aggregated or de-identified information;
Comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, mitigate risk, and perform similar purposes;
Understand usage trends and preferences;
Analyze, improve, and provide products and services;
Customize the content and advertising you see on the Smaato Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere; and/or
Perform other purposes at your request.
c. How We Share Information We Collect Through the Smaato Websites
We may share the information we collect through the Smaato Websites in the following situations:
With your consent, including through this Policy;
With our affiliates;
With third parties that help us to operate our business and provide our services, such as entities that provide us with technical, customer, billing, administrative, event planning, marketing, or operational services;
As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence);
When required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena, or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law enforcement agency or official, including for purposes of national security and law enforcement;
If we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury, or loss; or
If we believe sharing the information is necessary to protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
With respect to aggregated or de-identified information, we may share such information without restriction.
d. Analytics Services
For the purpose of designing our website in line with your needs, evaluating it from a business management perspective, controlling it and continuously optimizing our pages, we use services described in more detail below on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) and f) GDPR. All of the mentioned processing operations result in a transfer of data to the servers of the providers of tracking or targeting technologies commissioned by us. Some of these servers are located in the USA. The data transfer is based on so-called standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles and and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the/or Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles. If you do not agree with the storage and evaluation of your data, you can object to the storage and processing of your data in the consent banner on our website. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser, which means that the services used will not process any session data. However, you may then no longer be able to use all the functions on our websites. You can also prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of our websites to their full extent.
Google reCAPTCHA
We use the reCaptcha service of Google LLC (“Google”), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, to protect us from spam and misuse. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. This service serves to distinguish whether an entry was made by a human being or abusively by automated, machine processing. To determine this, Google places a cookie in your browser when you use the reCaptcha service and collects and processes the following data:
Referrer URL (address of the page on which the captcha is used)
Browser, browser size and resolution, browser plug-ins, date, language setting
Mouse- or Touch-Events within the reCaptcha box
Assignment to a Google account (if you are currently logged in to Google when using the reCaptcha service, this will be recognized and assigned)
Your input behaviour (e.g. answering the reCAPTCHA question, input speed into the form fields, order of selection of input fields by the user) is processed to improve pattern recognition on Google. Google also reads the cookies from other Google services such as Gmail, Search and Analytics. All of the above data is sent to Google in encrypted form. Google’s subsequent evaluation decides in which form the captcha is displayed on the page – in the form of a checkbox or by text input. A readout or saving of personal data from the input fields of the respective form does not take place. Further information about Google’s privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ .
Google Analytics – Google Universal Analytics
Smaato uses Google Universal Analytics, a web analytics tool from Google and we have a privacy agreement with Google. Google uses Cookies. The information generated by the Cookies on the use of the Smaato website by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, Smaato has activated the IP anonymization, so that your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before this happens. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of Smaato, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to us in connection with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We use this processing on the basis of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f) GDPR for range measurement and evaluation (so-called statistics). In this case there is no further processing of your data for marketing or retargeting purposes. This serves the business optimization of our processes. If you have given your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR), we will also process your data for marketing purposes. You can find more information on terms of use and data protection at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms or https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” in order to ensure the anonymous processing of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). If you do not agree with the processing of your data by Google Analytics, you can object here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
6. Data Access and Retention
Generally speaking, we retain the information collected from the Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services for as long as necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

7. Data Security
We have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed to protect the information from loss, misuse, or alteration. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.

This Policy only applies to the Smaato Websites and the Smaato Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that access or use the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services. Likewise, when you access the Smaato Websites, you may be directed to other websites that are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Policy.
9. Users from Outside the United States
The Smaato Websites and Smaato Ad Services are provided, supported, and hosted in the United States, and their operation is governed by United States law. If you are using the Smaato Websites or Smaato Ad Services from outside the United States, be aware that your Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and other countries where our facilities are located.

Please see Section 11 below, titled “The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)” for additional information we provide for the benefit of residents of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
10. California Privacy Notice

.
11. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. The GDPR requires Smaato and those using our services to provide users with certain information about the processing of their “Personal Data.” “Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, and Mobile IDs. To comply with the GDPR, we provide the below representations and information, which are specific to persons located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK and to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of Smaato, Inc., Barcastraße 5, 22087 Hamburg, Germany.
a. Legal Grounds for Processing Personal Data
The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Sections 1 and 2 above (and Section 5 as to the Smaato Websites) will typically be because:
You provided your consent.
In order to store and gain access to information stored on your device, we rely on your consent. For this “cookie consent” (which applies not only to “cookies” but also to Mobile IDs), we rely on mobile app developers and oblige them contractually to pass on only legally obtained data. We do so to fulfill our obligations under the ePrivacy Directive. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal;
The processing is in our legitimate interest.
In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data, in order to provide our and/or other data controllers’ services. Such processing goes beyond the original collection of Mobile IDs. A legitimate interest we rely on, for instance, is the tailoring of promotional communications within mobile apps and services, which is beneficial to End Users and is an integral part of the ecosystem by which freely available content is funded through advertising revenue. This also may include providing analysis of and reporting about ad campaigns. We also rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain the security of our services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed;
Contractual relationships.
Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact information);
Legal obligations.
Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
b.	Transfers of Personal Data
As Smaato is a global company and works with other global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. For instance, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, and which may have data protection laws that are less strict in comparison to those in Europe. When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. Your Personal Data will only be transferred to third countries outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK within the legally permissible framework. We transfer Personal Data to third countries outside the EU/EEA (a) as stipulated by law or based on your consent, (b) based on the adequacy decisions of the European Commission (a public and updated list of these countries can be found here) and (c) by contractual regulations such as the EU Standard Data Protection Clauses (a public and updated list of these clauses can be found here). These safeguards shall ensure an adequate level of protection of your Personal Data and you can access further details regarding these safeguards upon request. Smaato, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Smaato has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.

Further, Smaato is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Smaato commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU and UK individuals and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. or at the contact information in Section 14 below, titled “Contacting Us,” and we will work with you to resolve your issue. If you are a resident of the EU, UK, or Switzerland, you may also contact your appropriate European Data Protection Authority, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, with questions or complaints about our privacy practices. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we also commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, you may, under certain circumstances, invoke binding arbitration; please notify us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
and/or please visit
https://www.icdr.org/dpf
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of IDCR-AAA are provided at no cost to you.
c.	Personal Data Retention
As a general matter, we retain your Personal Data for only as long as necessary to provide our Smaato Ad Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. We generally render Mobile IDs inactive within 13 months, provided that we may retain them if we have a legal or significant operational need to do so, such as for auditing, corporate record-keeping, compliance accounting, or bug-fixes. If you are a Client of ours and thus have an account with us, we will typically retain your business-to-business Personal Data for a period of 3 years after you have requested that your account be closed, or such account has been inactive.
d.	Your Rights as a Data Subject
The GDPR provides you with certain rights in respect to Personal Data that data controllers hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to request correction of the Personal Data, to request to restrict or delete Personal Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for online ad targeting).
Right to Access:
If you wish to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller, you may do so by requesting access through the e-mail address
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
. When we receive your request, we will provide you with current, step-by-step instructions to follow in order to obtain access. We will then assess requests to exercise data access rights on a case-by-case basis; in doing so, we consider the difficulty of verifying whether a mobile identifier and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject making the request, as well as the potential adverse effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual. Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject, we may limit the Personal Data we make available. Please note that we will only grant requests submitted via email for Personal Data for which we are a data controller, as explained further below. Where we act as a data processor for one of our Clients, we will refer your request to that Client. Please identify the Client your request refers to (if possible), to simplify this process.
Right to Correct:
If you wish to exercise your right to correct Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.
Right to Object to Processing or to Withdraw Consent:
By using the device-based “opt-out” signals described in Section 4(b) above, you may withdraw consent for processing on which we rely on consent. If you do so, we will cease processing your Personal Data for purposes of our services within 30 days or less. We either collect these opt-out signals ourselves or receive them from the mobile apps we work with.
Right to Erasure.
You also have the right to obtain the erasure of Personal Data concerning you that we hold as a data controller. The above opt-out process satisfies this right. When an End User opts-out through device settings, and we receive this signal from our Clients, the Personal Data we use to provide our services will be deleted within 30 days (if you have an Android device) or permanently rendered disconnected to your device (if you have an iOS device). We will also manually delete your Personal Data, subject our identity verification process mentioned above, if you prefer that we do so; please contact us at
privacy@smaato.com
*protected email*
for further instructions on exercising this right manually. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of certain Personal Data on inactive or backup files, for our own internal and necessary purposes, such as auditing, accounting and billing, legal, or bug detection. We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill any important purposes that we have in retaining it, principally regarding legal, auditing, accounting, and billing obligations.
Right to Lodge Complaints.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us, so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you might have.
e.	Smaato as a Data Controller and a Data Processor
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, we encourage you to direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data controllers hold primary responsibility for your Personal Data. Smaato may act as either a data controller or a data processor in handling your Personal Data, depending on the precise circumstances. For instance, for Personal Data that we use internally and independently to operate the Smaato Ad Services, and for Personal Data that we collect about our Clients, we are a data controller. If Smaato is acting as a data Controller, it remains primarily liable where this data is passed to third parties. But when we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our Clients or Partners in order to provide our services to them, we are a data processor. Thus, for instance, if you have questions about data that is used primarily by a mobile app on which our technology is embedded – or companies that serve ads that use our technology – you should contact those companies regarding questions about the Personal Data they handle and control.

Product Privacy Policy — Verve Group Europe GmbH
Product Privacy Policy — Platform161 B.V.
Date modified:
March 10, 2025
Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy
Verve Group, Inc. and VGI CTV, Inc. (together “Verve”) are committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information.
This Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Verve processes personal information when providing advertising, measurement, and related services to our clients (“Services”). This Policy also describes your choices over such processing. This Policy does not describe how we process personal information relating to our website. For information on how we process personal information relating to our website please read our
Website Privacy Policy
.
“Personal Information” is information that identifies you or your household or can be reasonably linked directly or indirectly with you or your household. This Policy does not apply to anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate personal information as defined under applicable law.
Collecting Personal Information
We collect Personal Information when you knowingly and voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you provide us feedback or request information from us. This Personal Information will only be processed in connection with your feedback or request.
Verve may identify your device and collect Personal Information using an operating system-supplied ID such as Apple’s Advertising Identifier, Google’s Advertising Identifier, or a randomly assigned unique identifier (“Device Identifier”). The advertisements delivered by Verve may include forms or other prompts that allow you to opt-in to share data.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from any child under 13 years of age. If we are informed or become aware that our Services are being used on a site or app directed at children, we will restrict the use of ad-serving information to uses permitted under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
a) Location Data
In order to make advertising messages as relevant as possible, location data associated with Device Identifiers may be used for targeting ads and as input into location-targeting segments based on the characteristics of locations. Location data is also used to count impressions, clicks, and other metrics to model household locations for the purposes of demonstrating the marketing impact of advertiser campaigns. Location data that you provide to an app or website may be provided to Verve for ad-serving or reporting purposes. In addition, supplemental information may also be used such as a device’s speed of movement and positioning, proximity of nearby devices, or similar information available from an operating system.
You can opt-out of the use of data for location-based tracking by using the settings available on your mobile device. Ads will continue to be selected for you based on more general information, such as location that can be inferred from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other data.
b) Cookies
We collect information automatically when you use our Services through mobile websites or HTML by using log files and alpha-numeric identifiers known as “cookies” that are usually stored with the device’s web browser. This includes your IP address, browser type, browser language, device type and version, the date and time of your request, the amount of data transferred, the source of your request (page referrer), and the nature of the content delivered to you. We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following the directions in your internet browser. We also use log files and cookies to improve the quality of Services and pages you have visited.
In addition to the Device Identifiers described above, Verve will collect information about the type of app you are using and details such as IP address, device type, carrier, and operating system. Verve utilizes this information to uniquely identify mobile devices to deliver targeted marketing messages to consumers. We believe that the presentation of relevant marketing messages assists in providing a more meaningful mobile web experience. For example, this technology enables Verve to limit the number of times a specific message is presented to a consumer (frequency capping), to support product category preferential marketing, and to deliver advertising based on your location.
c) Web Beacons
We may permit publishers and advertisers to use a software technology called pixels (a.k.a., web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to report non-personal individual or aggregate information and help us better manage content on our Services. In addition, we may use pixels in our advertisements to let us know which ads have been viewed or to help tailor advertising.
d) Information from Third Parties
Our business partners may also collect Personal Information from you using a variety of technologies, including cookies, software development kits, and other digital trackers deployed on websites, mobile applications, or other digital services. They may share this information about your devices with us. We may add this to the information we obtain from your use of Services. You may be able to modify or disable the collection or sharing of Personal Information in your device settings.
Using Personal Information — Your Choices
Verve uses Personal Information to provide Services to our business partners. They are used to help tailor which ads are displayed to you as you visit websites or apps using our Services. Information that Verve collects as you visit a website or app will be used to create an ad-serving profile used to determine the ads displayed and to report about the effectiveness of that advertising. Personal Information collected by Verve may be linked with other available data about you from our business partners, including linking the various devices you may use. Where permitted by law, we use the information we collect to improve our products and services.

As a business, we do not sell Personal Information that we process when providing the Services. We disclose the following categories of Personal Information to business partners for the purpose of providing our Services:
Categories we collect:
We provide advertising technology services that facilitate transactions among demand-side platforms, advertisers, app developers, publishers of mobile websites and/or apps, and ad exchanges (collectively, “Clients”). Through our Services, we may collect information about you (to the extent that Clients pass such information to us), which may include mobile advertising identifiers, session and persistent cookies, IP addresses, apps used or downloaded, websites visited, browser and operating system type, type of device used, information actively provided by users responding to a form in an ad, randomly assigned identifiers, and general location information and system information that our SDK may collect about your device or network provider. This information is retained for a period of 14-30 days.
Categories of Sensitive Information:
We do not collect sensitive information.
Sources:
All the information above is collected from your device when you are using an app to visit a website and is provided to us by the business partner you interact with by using their app or viewing an ad. We also acquire this information from advertising or data exchanges.
Each Category is collected for the following business purposes: delivering ads on publisher sites, reporting on ad delivery, securing, protecting, auditing, bug and fraud detection, debugging and repair of errors, the detection, protection, and prosecution of security incidents or illegal activity; enforcing our terms and policies; complying with law.
Each Category is also collected for uses that advance our commercial interests including creating profiles to target ads on behalf of advertisers, using data collected from publishers and from other third parties.
Sale/Sharing Information
Verve may disclose the categories of information described above to business partners, such as analytics companies and may share the information with advertisers, ad networks, other partners, and third parties.
Opt-Out signals
If a Verve publisher or advertiser partner has transmitted to Verve a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” signal, an “Opt-Out of the Use of My Personal Information for Interest-Based Advertising” signal, or a “Limit Use of My Sensitive Personal Information” signal, we will limit our use of Personal Information from that partner and we will act only as a service provider as defined in the CCPA. You may also exercise your opt-out rights as described below.
Access, Deletion and Opt-Out Rights
Subject to certain exceptions and restrictions, the CCPA provides you as a California Resident the right to submit requests to Verve: (i) to provide you with access to the specific pieces and categories of Personal Information collected by Verve about you, the categories of sources for such Personal Information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such Personal Information, and the categories of third parties with which such information was shared; and (ii) to delete such Personal Information.

. We will need to verify your identity and that the information you requested relates to you before completing your rights request. We generally do not associate Personal Information (such as device history) with identified individuals as we generally do not have information such as names or email addresses connected to device information. Therefore, we will need your Advertiser Identifier to process your request. If you do not provide us with the required information, we will be unable to process your request.
You may designate an authorized agent to make California Requests on your behalf.
We do not discriminate against you.
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Verve does not discriminate against California Residents for exercising their rights.
We do not sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.
Additional Information for European Residents
If you are situated in the European Union, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom, the following provisions will apply in addition to the Advertising and Data Services Privacy Policy to any Personal Information.
Data Controller
For purposes of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Verve is the data controller of the Personal Information.
Legal Basis for Processing
We will process your Personal Information (a) for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by us in accordance with Art 6 para. 1 lit. (f) GDPR; or (b) because you have consented to the processing in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit (a) GDPR.
We will only process Personal Information based on our legitimate interests for storing and accessing Personal Information necessary to provide the Services; selecting, delivering and reporting on the effectiveness of advertisements; measuring the performance of advertisements and campaigns and investigating and preventing fraud.
Transferring your Information outside Europe
We transfer Personal Information from the European Union, the EEA and the United Kingdom, to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protection of the Personal Information.
If we transfer your personal information to a third-party service provider outside the European Union, the EEA or the United Kingdom we are responsible for such transfer and we will impose obligations on the recipients of that Personal Information to protect your data to the standard required in the GDPR.
Rights under the GDPR
You have the following rights: (a) you have the right to obtain information about the data processed about you (Art. 15 GDPR); (b) if inaccurate personal data is processed, you have a right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR); (c) if the legal requirements are met, you may request the erasion or restriction of processing as well as object to processing (Art. 17, 18, 21 GDPR); (d) if you have consented to the data processing or a contract for data processing exists and the data processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures, you may have a right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR).
We generally do not associate Personal Information (such as device history) with identified individuals as we generally do not have information such as names or email addresses connected to device information. Therefore, we will need your Advertiser Identifier to fulfill your rights. If you do not provide us with the required information, we will be unable to ensure your rights.

Privacy Shield Notice
1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“
Platform
”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our “
Clients
” include “
Advertisers
” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “
Publishers
” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“
End Users
“) of third party applications (“
apps
“) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “
Vungle Ad Services
“).
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free, and Vungle works hard to ensure that our ads are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“
you
“) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you use an app supported by Vungle technology (see Section 2.3,
below
, our services can collect certain information about your mobile device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal information” or “personal data” as defined under law in some jurisdictions (including in California and the EU, respectively) (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “
personal information
”). We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).
LEARN MORE
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device
, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle SDK version, information about the Publisher Client’s app currently active on your device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client’s app
, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, and session start/stop time. Historic versions of Vungle technology may also collect geolocation information (e.g., latitude and longitude co-ordinates), but only (i) if the Publisher Client’s app has enabled location services on your device and (ii) you have granted the Publisher permission to collect this information). However, versions that are current as of the date of this Notice no longer collect geolocation information.
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on
, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number of times you have seen the ad, the number of Vungle ads viewed per session, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal information, with information we may collect about your interactions with other ads served through Vungle’s Platform that you may view on other Publisher Client’s Apps, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information, including the personal information, we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes, including the following:
Serving Ads:
To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions:
: To allow Vungle to confirm with Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website and to ensure accurate billing for advertising services rendered.
Frequency Capping:
Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads:
To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics and Optimization:
To analyze and optimize ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, implementing end user “whitelists” or “blacklists” (to ensure, in some cases, that certain ads are being viewed by appropriate audiences), as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention:
Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:
Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
2.3
How does Vungle use its technology to collect information
?
We use our technology (in some jurisdictions, such as the EU, these may be referred to as “tracking technologies”) to collect information automatically from your device to perform many of the functions described in “
How do we use your information?
” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “
Opt-Out Choices
” below.
LEARN MORE
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile “SDKs” or “Software Development Kits” (including our own SDKs):
These are blocks of code that are embedded into an app allowing Vungle to collect certain information (as described in “
2.1 What information do we collect?
” above relating to your use of apps using our technology. The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes of delivering ads.
Mobile device identifiers:
We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Third-Party Ad Measurement URLs/Links:
Additionally, in providing the Vungle Ad Services to our Advertiser Clients, the Vungle ads may include URLs or links from the Advertiser Client’s chosen third-party measurement partner to collect information about your interaction with those ads. The information collected is used for ad delivery, reporting, and billing purposes and may also be used for performance optimization.
“Tags and Pixels”:
These are blocks of code that we and our Clients may use to monitor your interaction with apps using our technology. We may use these to synchronize information that we have collected with information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in
Section 2.1
to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information for advertising purposes, and you will (for all practical purposes) be a new user to our system. For apps using older versions of the Vungle SDK, you may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps that may allow collection of location of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1,
below
for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients or their agents. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Minors and Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply with data privacy protection legislation applicable to minors and children, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
“), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system when a Client indicates their app is subject to COPPA such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User personal information used by the Vungle Ad Services would be persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to provide “support for internal operations” of the Vungle Ad Services (as permitted by COPPA).
3. VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as
“http://vungle.com”
or any other website on which this Notice is posted) and other corporate services, web portals, and dashboards we make available to our Clients and End Users (collectively “

4.5 Third-Party Websites and Apps.
This Notice only applies to the Vungle Websites and Vungle Ad Services.

We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about you.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 22nd May 2024
Audiomob is an advertising technology company that allows game developers to monetise their games without interrupting gameplay, using audio ads.
A reference to “Audiomob” “we” or “our” means Audiomob Limited.
Audiomob provides advertising technology via our platform (“Audiomob Platform”) and related advertising tools (collectively the “Audiomob Services”).  We provide our services and tools to our “Developers,” who own and operate mobile applications (each a “Developer Property”) and “Buyers” who are advertisers and other ad partners looking to distribute ad content through the Audiomob Platform.  The Audiomob Services help Developers display advertising to end users (“Users”) who interact with Developer Property that use the Audiomob Services.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the information that we may process about end users (“Users”) through the Audiomob Services.
If you are resident in the European Economic Area and want to find out more about your data protection rights please see YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS below.
Audiomob may also share or license certain information about Users collected in connection with the Audiomob Services with brands, agencies and other interested third parties, to help them better identify and validate commercial opportunities, promote transparency and protect against fraud.
This Section covers all the information we collect and receive from Users in connection with our products and services, including Users of Developer Properties that use the Audiomob Services.
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information we automatically collect:
When a User visits a Developer Property that incorporates our technology, Audiomob and our partners use and deploy tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information about the Users and their devices.
Some of this information (including mobile advertising IDs) may identify a particular device and may be “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the State of California.
The Audiomob Services are designed to process information in such a manner that the information cannot be directly attributed to a specific, identifiable individual without the use of additional information (such as a name, address or email address).
Audiomob and our partners may collect this information the first time a User interacts with a Developer Property that utilises the Audiomob Services and we may combine and associate this information with information we (or our partners) may collect about the User’s interactions with other ads served through the Audiomob Platform.
The information we may collect includes:
Device information, such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android), user-agent, carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g. Wi-Fi or cellular), IP address, general location inferred from IP address, hardware-based identifiers (e.g. MAC address), information about our Developer apps and versions currently active on a device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to a device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (typically an alphanumeric string allocated to a device by the device manufacturer).
Information about a User’s behaviour on our Developer Property, such as information about the activities on those Developer Properties and geolocation (including latitude and longitude coordinates but only if the Developer Property has enabled location services on the device and the User has granted the Developer permission to collect and share this information for advertising purposes).
Information about Ads served, engaged with or interacted with, such as the type of Ad, where the Ad was served, the number of times a User has listened to the Ad, how long the Ad was engaged with, whether the User clicked on it and whether the User visited an advertiser website or relevant app store.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes. For example, we use the information we collect for the following purposes:
Providing the Audiomob Services: Generally we use the information we collect about Users to provide our products and services (including the Audiomob Services) as described in this Policy.
Serving Ads: To allow Developers to offer advertising inventory in their Developer Properties and Buyers to bid on and fill that inventory with relevant Ads.
Reporting: To provide information and reports to Buyers about when and how Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads or visited a Developer Property.
Frequency Capping: To prevent Users from seeing the same Ad too many times.
Performance Analytics: To analyse Ad performance, such as tracking engagement with ads and click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Location-Based Advertising: To deliver location based advertising services through the use of a User device’s physical location (where permitted by law).
Fraud Detection: To identify invalid Ad impressions, interactions or installs.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: Under applicable law, including laws outside a User’s country of residence, including responding to requests from government authorities, including and government authorities outside of a User’s country of residence, and to enforce our terms and conditions.
TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We may use tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, IDFA, AAID/GAID, UDID, ETags) to collect information automatically from Users devices.  They help us perform functions such as limiting the same Ad from continuously being served and serving an Ad more relevant to the User.
Cross-App and Cross-Device targeting
Our Developers and Buyers may use information that we share with them to establish connections among related devices for targeted advertising, analytics and reporting purposes.  They may match a User’s devices if the User logs utilises the same or similar service on multiple devices or if the User’s devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.  This means that information about a User’s use of applications on their device may be combined and used with information from the User’s other devices.
Our Developers and Buyers may use other information about a User’s activity across multiple, unaffiliated third-party mobile applications for targeted advertising, analytics and reporting purposes.  For example, if a User uses a travel app, these third parties may display travel-related ads to the User on other unrelated apps.  To opt out of cross-app targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the paragraph below titled “Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising in Mobile Apps” below.
GENERAL INFORMATION
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
Information we collect may be disclosed:
Developers:  If you are a User, we may disclose information collected through our Audiomob Services to our Developers to allow them to analyse the effectiveness and performance of our Audiomob Services and to offer targeted Ad inventory to our Buyers.
Buyers: If you are a User, we may share information we collect in connection with our Audiomob Services with our Buyers for purposes relevant to our business relationships with them, such as for billing purposes, dispute resolution or fraud prevention and to allow them to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory on our Developer Properties and other applications and to analyse the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns via the Audiomob Services.
Other clients: If you are a User, we may share certain information we collect in connection with our Audiomob Services with brands, agencies and other interested third parties to help them better identify and validate commercial opportunities.
Analytics Partners: If you are a User, we may share your information (such as your mobile device ID, or other unique identifier) with our attribution and analytics partners to validate and measure the success and effectiveness of Ads delivered via the Audiomob Platform.
Business transfers: We may share your information with a third party in the event of any reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or sock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
For legal purposes: We may share your information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence, to respond to requests from government authorities, including government authorities outside your country of residence and to enforce our terms and conditions.
With consent: We may disclose an individual’s information to any other person with the individual’s consent to such disclosure.
YOUR OPT-OUT CHOICES

Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of EU/EEA (for example, to third parties who provide us with services), we will generally obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. When Odeeo engages in such transfers of personal information, it relies on i) Adequacy Decisions as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) (for example, when we access from Israel), or ii) Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. Odeeo also continually monitors the circumstances surrounding such transfers in order to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by the GDPR.
7. Your Privacy Rights
7.1. EU Residents: If our processing of your Personal Data is subject to GDPR, you are entitled to the following rights (which may be subject to certain exemptions or derogations):

You have the right to request that we rectify any Personal Data we hold that is inaccurate or misleading;
You have the right to request the erasure/deletion of your Personal Data (e.g., from our records). Please note that there may be circumstances in which we are required to retain your Personal Data, for example for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims;
You have the right to object to or to request restriction of the processing;
You have the right to data portability. This means that you may have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and that you have the right to transmit that data to another controller;
You have the right to object to profiling;
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that there may be circumstances in which we are entitled to continue processing your data, in particular, if the processing is required to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.

You also have a right to request certain details of the basis on which your Personal Data is transferred outside the European Economic Area, but data transfer agreements and/or other details may need to be partially redacted for reasons of commercial confidentiality;
You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority (i.e., your place of habitual residence, place or work, or place of alleged infringement) at any time or before the relevant institutions in your place of residence.

Privacy Policy
LAST UPDATED:
January 12, 2021
EFFECTIVE DATE: February 15, 2021
Adverty AB (publ) (“Adverty” or “we”, “us”, “our”) is a technology company that creates and delivers advertisements to mobile, VR and AR enabled devices. This privacy statement (“Policy”) explains what kinds of information we collect and how Adverty strives to collect, use and disclose information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business. This Policy applies to our advertising platform (“Platform”) as well as our website located at
https://www.adverty.com
(“Website”).
Adverty is committed to protecting the privacy of advertising users accessing the Platform, visitors to our Website, and other Internet users (“Data Subjects” or “you”, “your”). If you have any concerns about this Policy or your privacy when your business or mobile device accesses our Platform or Website, please send an email to
privacy@adverty.com
and we will try to address your concern.
Privacy Practices
PERSONAL DATA
Adverty collects personal data in the course of our business. The definitions of personal data vary depending on the laws where you are located. For example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), personal data is defined broadly, and would include PII and Pseudonymous Identifiers (defined below). California’s privacy law defines personal information broadly, and would include PII and Pseudonymous Identifiers. Adverty will explain the different types of personal data below, and will try to be clear when we’re describing our use of each throughout this Policy.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)
Adverty collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that specifically identifies or locates a particular person or entity. We receive and store any PII you provide to us. The types of PII collected includes your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and other PII that you choose to provide on a particular data collection form. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, by completing an online form on the Website, by inquiring about employment or applying for a job at Adverty or by signing up on our Platform or e-newsletter. You may also provide us with PII in order to set up an account with us. Adverty uses this information for our reasonable business purposes, including to contact you to respond to your inquiry, to provide the service requested or to maintain your account with us. We may share your PII with partners such as advertising supply-side platforms as necessary to facilitate the Platform. Once obtained, Adverty will store your PII for as long as needed to provide services and for a reasonable time thereafter for record keeping purposes.
PSEUDONYMOUS IDENTIFIERS
In order to find the most interesting and valued advertising messages, Adverty collects pseudonymous identifiers. Pseudonymous means that we don’t know your identity as a natural person, but it helps us collect and make use of other personal data to better understand your interests and preferences. We describe this further in the “Other Personal Data” section below.
The pseudonymous identifiers include Google Advertising ID, Apple Identifier for Advertisers, DeviceId and IP address.
OTHER PERSONAL DATA
Adverty also collects other personal data from our Website such as Web pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to the Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system.
In our Platform we collect information from and about mobile apps that display ads, the specific ads viewed, interactions and transactions within ads or apps, the time/date of these events, mobile device type and characteristics, and mobile service provider.
We may use a third-party analytics provider to help us collect and manage this data. We use this information to help manage and improve your experience on our Platform or Website.
LOCATION DATA
In some cases, a mobile application may allow you to grant permission to send us location data such as latitude and longitude, and we may also store and process that in order to help deliver ads based upon the location of your mobile device. We have described our uses further in the section “Overview of Adverty’s Platform” below.
NO SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA
Adverty does not collect sensitive personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, nor does it process genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
COOKIES
On our Website, we may utilize “cookies” to automatically collect information about visitors to the Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your browser and that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages on our Website are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect PII. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s or mobile device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some features of the Website. We may also collect information on our Website using Web “beacons.” Web beacons are electronic images used on the Website or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and activity on the Website and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

CONTROLLING OUR USE OF DATA
You can always opt not to disclose certain data to us, but keep in mind all of the data we collect is needed to take advantage of some features of the Website or to help us find the most interesting and relevant advertising messages to share with you while you are using apps developed by our Publishers. You may request deletion of your data or if you have questions or other requests regarding your data, by sending an e-mail to

.
Adverty’s Platform
Adverty provides an advertising network and technology platform (“Platform”) to connect mobile, VR and AR applications and site publishers (“Publishers”) with advertisers (“Clients”).
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM
In the course of running our Platform, we collect information from Publishers and use such data for a number of purposes.
Our technology Platform collects and uses personal data, including but not limited to: the name of the Publishers on which the advertisement is served, the IP address used to access the Internet, device advertising identifiers (Google Advertising ID, Apple Identifier for Advertisers), the type of phone or other mobile device used (e.g., iPhone, iPad etc.), the operating system (Android, iOS), the date and time a particular ad is served, whether one of the ads we facilitate was delivered and, if applicable, a record if that ad was “clicked” or if it originated from a follow-up action to a third party such as a “conversion” event.
We work with third-party data partners and advertising exchanges to enhance our advertising and targeting capabilities on the Platform. As determined by our partners’ business and privacy policies, we may also receive and retain information from partners’ Publishers including but not limited to: the current location of the device, third-party applications on the device or in use at the time of our advertising transaction with the device, the Users age, gender or other demographic indicator, and we may use or derive data obtained from third parties such as approximate location based on IP address to help match data sets, although such data is processed outside of our Platform. We also collect Pseudonymous Identifiers and other personal data over time and across multiple Publishers and use that information to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to Users. Based on the privacy rules of the site or application owner and their business agreement with Adverty, we may integrate this Information with that acquired from other Publishers and third-party data providers. This information is then used to deliver advertisements and promotional information to the specific device identified based on the User’s online behavior or interests. This activity, called online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising, is currently limited to our advertising on mobile applications.
Choices Regarding Ad Targeting And Data Use
Adverty offers mechanisms that enable Users to opt-out of Adverty’s use of information for interest-based advertising. We do not currently respond to browser-based Do Not Track signals because our Platform operate primarily in the mobile application advertising space, and Do Not Track is browser based. Please note that you will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it will not be tailored based on any personal data. Please also note that our opt-out mechanism is browser or device specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers / devices you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser or device. Certain devices and device configurations may prevent our opt-out from operating correctly. Persons located in the European Economic Area have the right to object to our processing of their personal data and/or revoke their consent as described below.
OPT-OUT FROM OR OBJECT TO OUR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING AND/OR OUR SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We honor Apple “Limit Ad Tracking” and Google Opt out of “Ads Personalization” device settings. When we see those settings enacted on a mobile device, we treat that setting as a request to opt-out from interest based advertising and a request to opt-out from Adverty’s sale of data to third parties. Adverty works very hard to respect privacy and personal data and sees these global tools as having a damaging effect on your experience with advertising. There will always be advertising, so we believe that the best world is one where that ads are relevant to your interests and where you have granular control over which ad networks you trust with your personal data, not a tracking block for all ad networks.
Regardless of how you choose to share your preferences for interest-based ads tracking, for devices where we are able to see that an opt-out selection has been made, we will stop tracking your activities for the purposes of serving interest-based advertising.
ONWARD TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Adverty may share personal data with trusted partners. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for Adverty. The categories of third-party service providers used by Adverty include: a) cloud computer, data storage and file storage providers, b) email marketing providers, c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, e) customer billing systems partners, f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, g) social media platforms for advertising and marketing purposes, h) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly, i) auditing, debugging and security vendors.
Processing Purposes –
We provide our Clients with information about how many Users view or click the advertising served using our Platform. Similarly, we may share personal data with the Publishers on which we serve ads in order to optimize and report on the delivery of those ads. We may share information with ad networks, advertising exchanges, ad agencies in connection with the Platform for the business purpose of facilitating and targeting advertising campaigns.
Finally, Adverty may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Adverty is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.
Consent to Worldwide Transfer and Processing of Personal Information
Personal data given to Adverty may be processed by Adverty in all countries in which Adverty operates or in which its affiliates and partners operate. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your personal data. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, Adverty will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. With exception of persons located in the EU and Switzerland, by providing your Personal Information to Adverty, you consent to Adverty transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Data security –
The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open, global communications means, we cannot guarantee that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our Platform or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely secure from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you contact us by e-mail, a “contact us” or a similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure and that a third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.
Children –
Adverty adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the children’s privacy provisions of the General Data Privacy Regulation in the EU. We do not knowingly create nor use any interest-based advertising segments of children under 13 as part of our Platform. Our Website is not directed at children under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records. Where applicable law raises the age range from 13 to 16, Adverty complies with those laws.
Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation –
We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described above. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
Data Retention –
We store PII such as email address, telephone number or billing details for as long as you continue to have a business relationship with Adverty and for a reasonable time thereafter for record keeping purposes or as required by law. You may ask us to delete that information by following the instructions in “Access or Deletion” section. Where we store PII you provide on our Website as a Publisher or Client as described in “Personally Identifiable Information (PII)” section above, we use and retain such PII only as you direct.
We store Pseudonymous Identifiers such as device identifiers, IP addresses, as well as other personal data and cookie IDs so long as our systems continue to encounter a particular User. We retain raw information associated with Pseudonymous Identifiers that we have collected for up to 13 months, after which time the raw information is deleted and any remaining information is anonymized or aggregated with no personal data.
Your Data Access Rights
• If you are a Client or Publisher (i.e. a User with an account on our Website), you have a right to access to your personal data and you may update, correct, or delete your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and changing the information on file or by e-mailing Adverty at support@adverty.com with your request.
• If you are an ad User (i.e. you view ads delivered by our advertising Service or Platform), you may request to “know” (i.e., see) your personal data (which you can use to port your data to another provider), request that we “forget” (i.e., delete) your personal data by e-mailing Adverty at privacy@adverty.com with your request. By e-mailing your request you also consent to our storing and processing that personal data so that we can fulfill your request. California and EU data subjects may enjoy additional rights and protections as described below.
• Similarly, if you’ve provided us with PII via the Website and you don’t have ready access to an account, you may send us an email at
privacy@adverty.com
.
• To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps in all cases to verify your identity before granting Users profile access and we will respond / comply within 30 days.
Special Data Protections for California Data Subjects
Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including: a) the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know), b) the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of your information). We do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights. Moreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.
You may access those rights with respect to Adverty by e-mailing Adverty at privacy@adverty.com with your request. As a California data subject, if you make a subject access request as set out in this policy, you are entitled to see and delete the personal information that we have about you. We will attempt to confirm your request within 10 days and make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days.
The CCPA defines personal information broadly and as such, it includes pseudonymous identifiers such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs. The CCPA also defines the sale of personal information broadly and as such Adverty is considered to have sold the categories of information we collect via the Platform over the past 12 months.
We may take reasonable steps to verify your request.  We will fulfill requests we are able to verify so long as we are not prohibited from doing so by applicable law and/or the information is not essential for us for billing, fraud prevention or security purposes. We will share our reason(s) for denying your request in the event that we are unable to fulfill your request.
You may make an access or deletion request via an authorized agent by having such agent follow the process below. Please note that we may request that any authorized agent demonstrate that they have been authorized by you to make a request on your behalf. We require any authorized agents to provide us with contact details such as an email address and phone number so that we may ensure a timely response.
Special Data Protections for EEA Data Subjects
As of 25 May 2018, the General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) affords additional rights to EEA data subjects. As an EEA data subject, you have the right – partly under certain conditions:
• to
request information
about the processing of your data free of charge, as well as the receipt of a copy of your personal data. You can request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data being processed, the recipients of the data (if they are passed on), the duration of the storage or the criteria for determining the duration;
• to
correct
your data. Should your personal data be incomplete, you have the right to complete the data, taking into account the processing purposes;
• to
delete
or
block
your data. Reasons for the existence of a cancellation/blocking right can be, among others, the revocation of the consent on which the processing is based, the data subject objects to the processing, the personal data were processed unlawfully;
• to
restrict
the
processing
;
• to
object
the
processing
of your data;
• to
revoke your consent
to the processing of your data in the future, and;
• to
complain
to the competent supervisory authority about inadmissible data processing.
As an EEA data subject, you may invoke the above rights regarding the personal data processed by Adverty by e-mailing Adverty at privacy@adverty.comwith your request. Moreover, with respect to EEA data subjects, personal data includes Pseudonymous Identifiers such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.
Legal Bases for Processing
– Where Adverty is a controller of data, the legal basis will be both legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR) and consent (Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR) depending on the type of information subject to processing and the information we receive from upstream partners. We may also process data for the performance of a contract with you (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR).
Where we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk, does not involve the processing of sensitive data and will not violate fundamental human rights. (See a more detailed explanation in the “Legitimate Interest” section below.) In the event that Adverty is a processor of data, the legal basis for processing such data is determined by Publishers and/or our Clients.
Where Adverty receives from an EEA data subject a request to cease processing of data via one of the choice mechanisms listed above, Adverty will stop all data processing with respect to the opted out device except in the routing or grouping of the data in order to complete an advertising request or unless such processing is required by law.
Legitimate Interest
Adverty has assessed that it has legitimate interest in the collection of this information pursuant to 6(1)(f) of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In our assessment, we believe that all data processing currently engaged upon via the Adverty Marketplace falls under the “legitimate interest” legal basis. A summary of our rationale is as follows:
• Pre-internet, digital publishers were able to monetize their audience subscription lists for direct marketing purposes utilizing legitimate interest, and advertisers were able to use that data for direct marketing purposes on the same basis. Data subjects typically had to pay subscription fees to access content.
• In the digital age, publishers still need to monetize their audiences in order to continue to provide free content and Advertisers continue to need to reach their desired audiences. Data subjects have become increasingly reluctant to pay cash for digital content from Web sites and mobile apps.
• The types of data segments utilized by Adverty and the profiling activities are not generally considered high risk per the guidance of the A29WP.
• Users are increasingly savvy about the types of data being collected about them via Web sites for digital advertising. Moreover, transparency tools which explain the data collection practices of companies such as Adverty are increasingly ubiquitous.
• Adverty adopts reasonable controls to ensure that the data collected is secured and won’t fall into the hands of an entity that might be in position to harm the human rights of data subjects.
• Thus, the balance of interests leans towards the benefits generated for data subjects, publishers and advertisers, and those benefits outweigh the risks to the fundamental human rights of data subjects.
• Accordingly, Adverty feels confident that the processing activities engaged upon via the Adverty marketplace fall under the legal basis of legitimate interest.

When we do, we will also revise the “Last Updated” label above. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the information we collect.

We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information and data by Gadsme. Publishers, advertisers and other websites that may be accessible through our Services have their own privacy policies and practices that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when you interact with their services and use their products.

Do Not Track Signals
Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers.

Privacy Policy
Last revised: January 7, 2025.
Appnext is dedicated to providing internet users the highest level of transparency and control over the use of their data in online advertising. We adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
(EDAA). Appnext also adheres to the
Interactive Advertising Bureau’s
(IAB)
Europe Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
Introduction
This privacy policy and notice (“Privacy Policy”) explains what types of information Appnext PTE. Ltd (“Appnext”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses and shares, in order to provide our advertising and mobile distribution and promotion services to our business partners and clients, application publishers and advertisers (“Publishers” and “Advertisers”, respectively. And collectively, “Partners”), as well as information we collect when you visit our website (
www.appnext.com)
.
We collect information through our APIs, software development kit, and similar technological solutions (together, the “SDK”), integrated in third party mobile applications, in order to allow the tracking of mobile application use, installations and downloads, and to enable the serving of advertising and personalized content. In order to do this, Publishers and Advertisers have to actively set parameters that allow for such integration and measurement. In such instances, information collected and processed may be provided to both the app owner and other Partners.
We collect information about users who download and use applications which contain our SDK or otherwise interact with us through advertisements served to them (“End Users”). Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us, so please read this Privacy Policy carefully to learn about your choices.
For the purposes of EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and other applicable data protection and privacy laws, Appnext is a data controller in relation to the personal data of our Partners and prospective partners, End Users and our website visitors. However, when processing End User data on a Partner’s behalf, such as when information is provided to us by an Advertiser or processed on a Publisher’s instruction, we act as a data processor. In these instances, the Partner serves as the controller, and their privacy policy governs the processing of your data. As a processor, we follow the controller’s instructions, meaning our own privacy policy does not apply to this processing.
What information we collect
Summary: we collect various categories of personal data in order to meet our contractual obligations, and also to meet various legitimate interests, such as fraud prevention and marketing.
We collect data about you in connection with your transactions with us, or in processing data for our Partners, when End Users use apps containing our SDK or when you interact with ads served to you. We also collect data about our website visitors. One type of data collected is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“non-personal data”). We also collect several categories of personal data (“Personal Data”), as described below:
When using our website
– our webserver will collect information like your IP-address, the website from which you were referred to our website, the webpages you are visiting on our Website, the browser you are using and its display settings, your operating system as well as date and duration of your visit. Further personal data will only be stored and processed if you voluntarily provide it to us, e.g. through a contact form.
Device and app information
– this category includes your device’s type and model, system language, the device’s operating system), SDK version, mobile carrier name, mobile browsers installed on the device (such as Chrome or Safari), app history and usage information (such as information about running and installed apps on the device), information regarding downloads and installations of mobile applications and any information regarding in-app events (such as in-app purchases), your device’s IP address, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its Android Advertising ID, or other types of unique device identifiers (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).
Ad information
– this category includes information about the online ads and personalized content we have served (or attempted to serve) to you. It includes things like how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on, whether you viewed, clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad, ad engagement history and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website, downloaded an app or purchased the product or service advertised.
Location information
– Appnext collects information about your general location (such as city and country). For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location. This information does not tell us where your device is precisely located. This information is sent as a normal part of internet traffic. In addition, we also collect implicit location information, which allows us to infer that you are either interested in a place or that you might be at the place – this information does not actually tell us where your device is precisely located.
In addition, Appnext may collect the precise location of your device (using GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth signals, Beacons signals and cell tower ids that can be used to derive or estimate precise location, or other geo-location data), when location services have been enabled by the end user for the mobile app or website that uses our SDK (you typically have to choose to turn on device-based location services).
Log information
– this category includes the app or website visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular), and cookie information.
Information from advertising partners and other third parties
– this category includes information we receive from our Publishers, Advertisers and other Partners that we work with to help us deliver ads and personalized content to you and recognize you across browsers and devices. This may include pseudonymous advertiser identifiers that some Advertisers, Publishers or other third party ad platforms choose to share with us. This information is also used to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
Serving ads and promoting apps
– allow our Publishers to promote advertising, apps and content in their mobile apps, and to allow Advertisers to bid on Publishers’ inventory.
Serve interest-based advertising and personalized content
– enable our partners to infer interests and serve ads and personalized content to users based on their behavior, app activity and inferred interests. We will not serve interest-based ads or personalized content based on information that we consider sensitive, such as race, religion or health.
Ad reporting and conversions
– measure ad performance, report to Advertisers when and how users have viewed or clicked on their ads, or visited their website, and to report to Publishers when and how ads were shown on their properties and were clicked on.
Analytics and frequency capping
– allow our Publishers to analyze their applications (for this purpose, we use aggregated and anonymous benchmark data) and prevent users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Fraud detection and prevention and ensuring security
– identify invalid or incentivized clicks (or ad queries) and protect Appnext and our partners from fraudulent behavior and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely.
Enforce our policies, resolve disputes and communicate with you.
Providing and improving our services
– audit, research and analyze information in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly.
Information Sharing
We share information about you with:
A Publisher whose app you have accessed
– we share information about how you have interacted with that Publisher’s app and its ads and personalized content.
An Advertiser whose site or app you have visited
or advertisement you have viewed – we share information about how you have interacted with that Advertiser’s site, app or its ads.
With our service providers
– we contract with companies who help with parts of our business operations (for example, storage of information). We require that our service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us.
With our subsidiaries and related companies.
In connection with legal proceedings
– when we are under a legal obligation to do so, for example to comply with a binding order of a court, or where disclosure is necessary to exercise, establish or defend the legal rights of Appnext, our Partners or any other third party.
In connection with a sale of our business
– if a third party acquires some or all of our business or assets, we may disclose your information in connection with the sale.
In addition, we may disclose aggregated, anonymized information with other third parties. This information cannot be used to identify you.
How We Collect Information
When operating our services, we use various technological tracking tools to collect information from your device, such as:
Our SDK – the SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers (such as our Publishers) can include in their apps to enable ads and personalized content to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
Along with our Partners, we may use tracking technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage such as HTML5. Our Partners may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash. Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 and Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash are used to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS’s. Beacons are clear graphic image(s) of 1×1 pixel that is delivered through a web browser usually as part of a webpage request. Web beacons operate as a tag that records an end users visit to a particular webpage.
Our Publisher and Advertisers may use cookies to track your behavior on their apps or websites. A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating server when the visitor returns. Most web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Appnext may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.

Online Behavioral Advertising
Appnext complies with Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
(EDAA). Appnext also adheres to the
Interactive Advertising Bureau’s
(IAB)
Europe
Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
We use third parties who collect data about their apps’ and sites’ visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
These third parties include Publishers, Advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your online activities over time and across different apps and websites.
Like most online marketing platforms, we place our Advertisers’ ads where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient. When an End User visits a third-party website or app on which a network advertising company has purchased ad space, the Advertiser can then recognize the individual’s interest and deliver one of our advertisements.
End User choice and Opt Out
Appnext supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive.
To serve personalized content and ads we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes we link the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
You may opt out of personalized ads in apps on your mobile device, by changing your settings. For instance, if you have an Android device –
Find Google Settings – depending on your device, it could be located here:
A separate app called
Google Settings
In your main
Settings
app, scroll down and tap
Google
Tap
Ads
Switch off setting of “Ads based on your interest”
When you have opted out using these settings on a device, Appnext will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests. Appnext requires its Partners to honor opt-out preferences expressed using these controls. However, please note that opting-out using these settings would only prevents serving tailored ads to you;
this would not affect other activities
, such as serving contextual advertising, ad frequency capping and analytics.
You can turn off certain third party cookies for advertising purposes by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative, located here:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
or the DAA opt-out program, which are located here:

, here (for EU/EEA citizens):

and here (for mobile devices):

Do Not Track Disclosure
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow users another method of informing websites and services that they do not want certain information about their website visits collected over time and across websites. Because the effect of DNT signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a DNT signal from your browser. Rather, we provide or respect the consumer choice options set forth in this privacy policy.
Information Retention
We retain personally identifiable information we process on behalf of our Partners for as long as needed to provide services to them. We retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
End User Rights
If you reside in the EU or in a different jurisdiction that affords you with the below rights, you may contact us at any time by
data-privacy@Appnext.com
and request to:
Receive confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning you is being processed, and access your stored personal information, together with certain supplementary information.
Receive personal information you directly volunteer to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
Request rectification of your personal information.
Request erasure of your personal information.
Object to the processing of personal information by us.
Request to restrict processing of your personal information by us.
Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Please note that these rights are not absolute and requests are subject to any applicable legal requirements. In addition, we may not be able to exercise your request in the event we cannot identify you
In addition, we may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion, in accordance with our internal policies.
Security
Appnext has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to information will not occur; we make good faith efforts to prevent such occurrences. We do not warrant or represent that your account or any of your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
International transfers
Appnext may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country where we originally collected it for the purposes of storage and processing of information and operating our services. Those countries may not have the same information protection laws as your country. However, when we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that international transfers comply with applicable laws. For example, if we transfer your information from the European Economic Area to a country outside it, such as the United States, we will seek to take additional steps such as entering into EU compliant data transfer agreements (model clauses) with the data importer where necessary.
Children Information
Appnext does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information (including persistent device identifiers) relating to children under the age of consent (namely, below the age where consent must be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, as required the applicable law in the jurisdiction you reside in (“Age of Consent”). In addition, we require our Publishers to certify to us that their services (such as their mobile apps) are not primarily directed to appeal to children under the age of Age of Consent, and to avoid sharing with us any personally identifiable information relating to children under the age of Age of Consent.
Please note that while we strive hard to ensure that our policies are respected, we cannot be held responsible for the practices of our Publishers. Our publishers are responsible to ensure that their privacy practices comply with applicable privacy laws and requirements, including with respect to safeguarding children’s privacy (such as by complying with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998).
If you have knowledge of any incident in which we may be collecting personal data relating to children under the Age of Consent, or that our SDK is included in any service (such as a mobile app) that is directed to or aimed to appeal to audience under the Age of Consent, please let us know immediately by contacting us at:
data-privacy@Appnext.com
, and we will remove their personally identifiable information from our servers without delay.
Changes to Our Privacy Practices
We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our privacy practices, from time to time. If we make any material changes we will post such amendment on our website, prior to the change becoming effective; material changes will become effective seven (7) days as of the date we posted the notice on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices (the last change will be reflected in the “last revised” date above).

3. Personal data
Personal data is information about personal or factual circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number and date of birth, but also data about your specific career, etc., which can be assigned to a specific person with reasonable effort.
Information that is anonymized and not associated with your identity, however, is not personal data.
4. Purposes of the processing of personal data
Some of the personal data and further information we may collect from you is necessary to enable us to provide you with the services you request, to fulfil our contracts with you, to comply with legal requirements or if we have a legitimate interest in the use of your information, for example, when we use your personal data to be able to offer you an extensive and interesting offer via our websites and our web services and to constantly improve these.
When we collect data directly from you, we may ask you for your consent and clearly mark mandatory information (e.g. with an asterisk (*)). You voluntarily provide us with any other information that is not marked.
We will generally collect, process and use the personal data you provide online only within the legal bases provided for within the applicable data protection legislation or within the borders of your consent and as well only for the purposes disclosed to you.
5. General legal bases
The legal bases for the processing of your personal data may be the following:
Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6 para 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.
Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
6. Which personal data is collected and processed?
You can generally browse our websites without providing us with personal data (e.g. name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) that reveal your identity directly to us, unless you make them available to us voluntarily (e.g. for registrations for events, enquiries or surveys) or you have consented to the intended use or otherwise the corresponding legal provisions on the protection of your data permit the specific use of your personal data according to the aforementioned legal bases for specific purposes.
Particularly, your personal data may be used as follows:
6.1 Applications and the application procedures
If you are interested in working for our company, you can also apply for a position within adjoe GmbH and become part of our team. If you apply to us electronically, i.e. by e-mail or via our web form, we collect and process your personal data for the purpose of handling the application procedure and carrying out pre-contractual measures.
By submitting an application on our recruiting page and sending us your application documents, you express your interest in joining us to work for us and make your personal data available to adjoe for the purpose of applying for a specific position advertised by us. In this context, you provide us with personal data which we use and store exclusively for the purpose of your job search/application.
In particular, the following data is collected:
Your name (first and last name)
Your e-mail address
Your resume/CV
Salary expectations
Your possible start date
Information on how you heard about the vacant position
You also have the opportunity to upload relevant documents such as a cover letter, references and certificates, and further documents that you consider significant in the context of your application. These documents, just like CVs, may contain further personal data such as date of birth, address, etc.
Finally, you have to confirm that you have read our Data Protection Notice before submitting your application.
The scope of personal data that you need to provide to us as part of your application depends on the scope and type of your application or the position advertised with us. You are generally free to decide which data you provide us with. However, we may not be able to consider your application without certain information that is required in the individual case or according to the job posting. If necessary, please refer to the job posting for which you wish to apply to find out whether certain information is required.
We clearly mark mandatory information there (e.g., with an asterisk (*)). In these cases, you provide us with all other information not marked with an asterisk voluntarily.
Note on special categories of personal data
:
We would like to point out that job applications, in particular resumes, references and other data you send us, may contain particularly sensitive
information
about your state of health, your racial or ethnic origin, your political opinions, your religious or philosophical beliefs, your memberships in a trade union or political party, or your sex life. However, we do not request such data from you and you provide us with such information voluntarily and on the basis of your consent. This consent also relates to the processing of all personal data of a special nature submitted as part of your application in accordance with the provisions of this data protection declaration.
In the further course of the application process, we may also collect further data from you and process them, together with the information you provided in the course of your application, for the purposes stated here. This may also include our assessment of whether you are qualified and suitable for filling vacancies in our company.
If you apply to us, your any of the personal data you provide to us is stored and used exclusively for the purpose of filling the vacant position for which you have applied and to be able to contact you personally on the basis of your application and, if necessary, to initiate a possible employment relationship with you.
Only authorized employees from our personnel department or employees involved in the application process have access to your data. A transfer of your personal data to third parties or a use of your data for advertising purposes will not take place unless you have expressly consented to it. A use of your personal data beyond the uses mentioned in this Data Protection Notice does not take place.
Retention of your application data
Your data will generally be stored for a period of 180 days after the end of the application process. As a rule, this is done to fulfil legal obligations or to defend against any claims arising from legal regulations. We are then obliged to delete or anonymize your data. In this case, the data is only available to us as so-called metadata without direct personal reference for statistical evaluations (for example, proportion of applications regarding gender, number of applications per period, etc.).
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), in this context directed towards the conclusion of an employment contract with you and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests), in this context, directed at our legitimate interest in being able to defend ourselves in the event of legal claims being brought against us on the basis of general equality legislation. With regard to the processing of (possibly special categories of) personal data provided in addition to the mandatory data, the legal basis is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR (which permits data processing on the basis of your consent).
Prolonged retention (“Talent Pool”)
In addition, and only with your specific consent to do so, we store your data for inclusion in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool” for 2 years after the end of the application process in order to identify any other interesting positions for you. This also applies, for example, to applications for training or internship positions.
In this case, we will continue to use all of the data collected from you as part of the application process in order to review your application in relation to vacancies at our company and other companies of the whole Applike group and in order to be able to contact you personally on the basis of your application, as well as to initiate a possible employment relationship with you, if applicable.
In the event that we are currently unable to offer you a position in our company, you can already request to be included in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool” in the course of your application and give the corresponding consent to the extended processing period of your application data.
In the event of extended storage of your data within the Applike group’s Talent Pool, the processing of your personal data is subject to joint controllership in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR. For all details in this context, please refer to the Data Protection Notice on the joint website of the companies of the Applike group.
You can revoke your consent to the use of your application data at any time with effect for the future. To do so, simply send an e-mail to the e-mail address
privacy@adjoe.io
. Your data will then be deleted from our applicant database; if deletion is not possible, blocking will take the place of deletion. In this case, we can no longer consider your application.
Additional charges (beyond the regular transmission fees of your Internet or telephone provider) will not be incurred for the revocation.
You are not obliged to consent to an extended storage of your application data in the Applike group’s “Talent Pool”. Without your consent, we are however unable to include you in our “Talent Pool” and must delete your application data in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.1.1 after completion of the initial application process.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR (which permits data processing on the basis of your consent).
Data processing within the scope of the employment relationship
If you receive and accept an offer of employment with us as part of the application process, we will store the personal data collected during the application process at least for the duration of the employment relationship.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), in this context directed towards the conclusion of an employment contract with you and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests), in this context, we use your personal data mainly for the purpose of establishing, implementing and, if necessary, processing and terminating the employment relationship entered into with you. You will be informed in detail about the processing of your personal data and the legal bases thereof within the scope of the employment relationship entered into with the companies of the Applike group when the employment contract is concluded.

Further, it is generally your free decision which data you provide to us. However, we may not be able to fulfil your contact request without certain details required in individual cases.
The legal basis for this data processing is that of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR (which permits the processing of data to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures), Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR (which permits the processing of data to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests).

6.3          Server-Log files
Your visit to our websites is automatically logged by our web servers. In connection with the retrieval of the information you requested from our web services, data is collected for the provision of our various services or for evaluation and security purposes and, if necessary, stored in anonymized form (without personal reference). The web servers we use automatically store data about the retrieval of our web services in so-called server log files. These are the following data:
Your IP address
The URLs you access on our web pages
Referrer URL (the page from which you visit us)
Time of the server request
Host name of the accessing terminal (the name of your Internet service provider)
Browser type and browser version
Operating system used and its settings
The processing of the above data is done for security purposes, for general fraud prevention and as a precaution against attacks on our web services. An automated combination of this data with data from other data sources does not take place.
If we also automatically log your IP address, this is automatically deleted after 30 days at the latest .
Furthermore, we store the URL accessed with the associated page title and optional information on the page content; information on the terminal device used, operating system and browser. This information is generally transmitted with each individual page request when using the Internet. However, unlike cookies and similar technologies, no information is read from the memory of the user’s terminal device and no information is stored on this terminal device.
Since the privacy of our visitors is important to us, this data is processed without being merged with other data provided by you, such as your contact details, and furthermore, data that may allow a reference to an individual person, such as the IP address, login or device identifiers, are anonymized or pseudonymized immediately after collection by deleting the last number block. No other use, combination with other data or disclosure to third parties takes place.
This data processing is based on the legal basis of Article 6 para.1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which allows data processing based on our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR is the optimization and technical security of our online offers and our web services.
Apart from that, only general information is recorded, e.g. when which content from our offer is called up or which pages are visited most frequently, the names of the requested files as well as their call-up date and time. These data are evaluated to improve our offer and do not allow any conclusions about your person. We will not use this information for any other purpose.
The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR, which allows the processing of data to protect the legitimate interests of the data controller.
7.             Our social media appearances
We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.
7.1          Data processing through social networks
Social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:
If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
7.2          Legal bases
Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR).
7.3          Responsibility and assertion of rights
If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Stack Overflow, X, Medium and MeetUp).
Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.
7.4          Storage time
The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular, retention periods – remain unaffected.
We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes. Particularly cookies and similar techniques stored on your device by the respective social media provider may remain until you delete them (please refer to the following section 8 of this Data Protection Notice for further information on the cookies that we use on our website). For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).

8.2.2
Additional information on Google Signals
Google Signals is a feature in Google Analytics that collects session data from websites and apps where users are logged in with their Google Account and have enabled personalized advertising. It enables advanced analysis by linking user behavior across different devices and providing additional information such as demographic characteristics and interests. Your consent to the use of Google Analytics (see above) also includes consent to the Google Signals add-on function.
Additional information on Consent Mode, advanced implementation
Under the Digital Markets Act, Google is obliged to obtain user consent before processing user data for personalized advertising. Google fulfils this requirement with the “Consent Mode”. Users are obliged to implement this and thus prove that they have obtained the consent of website visitors.
Google offers two implementation modes, the basic and the advanced implementation.
We use the extended implementation method of Google Consent Mode. If you consent to data processing in connection with the use of GA4 (see above), a connection to Google is established, Google Analytics cookies are set and the corresponding processing is carried out. If you refuse consent, no Google Analytics cookies will be set. However, a unique “ping ID” will be generated and transmitted to Google. The Google code is executed, whereby only limited user data is transmitted to Google, including information such as:
IP address
Browser details
Visited URL
A personalised user ID is not assigned.
If you have consented to the execution of Google Analytics 4, Consent Mode, extended implementation, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR. In addition, it is in our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR to use Google Analytics 4, Consent Mode, extended implementation, in order to obtain data on conversions without creating user profiles and thus increase profitability.

The USA has been assessed by the European Court of Justice as a country with an insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards. In particular, there is a risk that your data may be processed by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes, possibly without any legal remedy. If you do not consent to the use of this service, the transfer described above will not take place.
We request your consent with the help of our
PRIVACY PREFERENCES MANAGER
, within which you can also revoke your consent at any time and adapt your settings to your wishes and needs at any time with effect for the future, without this causing you any disadvantages.
8.2.3     Google Maps
Within our websites, we may use map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

If you consent to the execution of Google Maps the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR.
By consenting to the use of Google Maps, you also consent to your data being processed in the United States of America (USA) in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The USA has been assessed by the European Court of Justice as a country with an insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards. In particular, there is a risk that your data may be processed by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes, possibly without any legal remedy.

Browser information,
Date and time of access,
Device information,
The URL of the visited website,

The consent status is also stored in the end user’s browser so that the website can automatically read and follow the end user’s consent in all subsequent page requests and future end user sessions for up to 12 months. Consent data (consent and withdrawal of consent) is stored for three years. The retention period corresponds to the regular limitation period according to § 195 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch [BGB]). The data is then deleted immediately.
The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the described processing. There is no possibility for the user to object as long as there is a legal obligation to obtain the user’s consent to certain data processing operations (Art. 7 para. 1, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR).
Borlabs GmbH acts as a data processor for us.
9. Period for which the personal data will be stored
We only store personal data that you provide to us for as long as they are needed to fulfil the purposes for which these data were provided or as long as this is required by law:
If you conclude contracts with us, we store and process your personal data for the duration of your contractual relationship with us and also for the fulfilment of legal post-contractual archiving obligations and for the duration of the statutory retention periods (maximum 10 years);
If you apply through us for vacant positions with us, we will delete your application data at the latest 180 days after completion of the application procedure, unless you have given us your consent to store your data two more years in the talent pool for future job vacancies;
If you send us an inquiry, we process your personal data for the duration of processing your inquiry and for the period we may need to document the inquiry process and our answers.
Generally, we delete or anonymize your personal data from our systems and records, so that you can no longer be identified, when they are no longer needed. We may retain certain personal data in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and to enable us to administer our rights (e.g. to enforce our claims in court), or for statistical purposes (in anonymous form).
10. With whom do we share Personal Data?
If these cases are not listed in this Data Protection Notice, we will not sell or market your personal data to third parties or forward them on for any other reason.
In addition to the other cases mentioned in this Data Protection Notice, your personal data will only be passed on without your express prior consent in the following cases:
If it is necessary for the clarification of an illegal or abusive of our web services or for the prosecution, personal data are passed on to the prosecution authorities as well as if necessary, to damaged third parties. However, this only happens if there are concrete indications of illegal or abusive behaviour. A disclosure to third parties bound to professional secrecy can take place if this is necessary to enforce the contractual conditions or other agreements as well as our claims arising from contracts that you have concluded with us. The legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests.
Further, we may also be legally obliged to provide information to certain public authorities upon request. These are law enforcement authorities, authorities that prosecute fined offences and the tax authorities.
As our business develops, the structure of our company may change as its legal form changes, subsidiaries, parts of companies or components are established, purchased or sold. In such transactions, customer information will be shared with the part of the company to be transferred with your consent. Whenever personal data is passed on to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that it is used in accordance with this data protection declaration and the relevant data protection laws and ask you for your consent.
11. Who is involved in processing your Personal Data?
We process your personal data collected through the website and may also engage third parties to assist us according to our instructions and therefore, your personal data can also be processed on our behalf by our reliable, external service providers (“contract processors”). We solely rely on trusted and reliable contract processors who conduct a number of business processes on our behalf and only provide them with the information they need to provide their services to us. We make every effort to ensure that all contract providers with whom we work strictly protect your personal data and use them only for the purposes to which we assign them and on our behalf. For example, we can commission the following services for which the processing of your personal data is necessary to our contract processors or our contract processors may be
Third parties who support and help us to provide digital and e-commerce services, including CRM, web analytics and search engine and user content maintenance tools;
Advertising, marketing, digital and social media agencies to assist us with advertising, marketing and campaign activities, to analyse their effectiveness and to manage your contact requests and questions;
Third parties who assist us in providing IT services, including platform providers, hosting services, maintenance and support for our databases, and our software and applications that contain information about you (in some cases, such services simply include access to your data to perform the desired task);
Particularly, the data provided in the context of your application will be transmitted via TLS encryption and is stored in a database within a cloud-based system for online applications and to carry out the application process. The Applike Group uses a cloud-based system (“Lever”) from the specialized provider Employ, Inc., 20 North Meridian Street, Suite # 300, Indianapolis, IN 46204, USA for the online application and the implementation of the application process. This is the service provider for the employer and may also receive knowledge of personal data of the applicants in connection with the maintenance and maintenance of the systems. The Applike group has concluded a data processing agreement according to Article 28 GDPR with this provider, which ensures that the data processing is only carried out in accordance with the Applike group’s instructions and in a permissible manner, and that the data is not passed on to third parties. The data processed by Employ, Inc. is hosted in the EU. Employ, Inc. collects and processes personal data exclusively in accordance with the instructions received or the consent of the employer and in accordance with the applicable data protection laws. Where necessary, Employ, Inc. transfers personal data in individual cases to group companies and suppliers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. For data transfers to the US, the provider has joined the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which ensures compliance with the European data protection level on the basis of an adequacy decision by the European Commission. Further information on this is available from the provider at the following link:
https://www.lever.co/privacy-notice/
.
The legal basis for data transmission is Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual measures and Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data in order to safeguard the data controller’s legitimate interests.
We have concluded a contract with all our contract processors on the commissioned data processing on our behalf in accordance with Article 28 GDPR and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using their services.
12. Data transfers to “Third Countries”
If we process data in a Third Country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this is only done in accordance with the strict legal requirements of the EU and we ensure that your data is treated in accordance with the provisions of this Data Protection Notice.
Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or have the data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through the so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission (SCC), in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations according to Articles 44 to 49 GDPR; further information can be found on the websites of the EU Commission under the URL
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en
. Where necessary, we and our contract processors will, where applicable, also take supplementary measures to ensure the protection of your privacy rights, the confidentiality of your personal data and compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of the EU.
13. Data Security
We make every effort to take extensive technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against unintentional or unlawful deletion, alteration or loss and against unauthorized disclosure or access. All our employees are accordingly bound to secrecy and data protection. Insofar as it is within our sphere of influence, we use modern encryption techniques and a large number of other measures in particular to prevent unauthorized access by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption exists, the data you exchange with us cannot be read by third parties.
Further, our security precautions are regularly checked and adapted to technological progress.
However, we would like to point out that due to the structure of the Internet, it is possible that the rules of data protection and the above-mentioned security measures may not be observed by other persons or institutions for which we are not responsible. In particular, unencrypted data can be accessed by third parties – particularly if this is done by e-mail. We have no technical influence on this. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the user to protect the data provided by him against misuse by encryption or in any other way.
14.          Your Rights as a Data Subject
If we process personal data as the data controller, you as the data subject have certain rights under Chapter III of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), depending on the legal basis and purpose of the processing, in particular the right of access (Article 15 GDPR), the right to rectification (Article16 GDPR), the right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) (Article 17 GDPR), the right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR), the right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR), the right to object (Article 21 GDPR). If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to revoke this data protection consent in accordance with Article 7 para. 3 GDPR.
If you wish to exercise your above rights, please contact us using the contact details given in section 2 of this Data Protection Notice.
Please note that we may require proof of identity and full details of your request before we can process your request.
15.          Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authorities
In the event of data protection violations on our part, you have a right of appeal to the responsible supervisory authority.
The supervisory authority responsible for adjoe GmbH in data protection law matters is the Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (HmbBfDI), the contact details of which can be found in the following link:
https://www.datenschutz-hamburg.de/wir-ueber-uns-kontakt/wie-erreichen-sie-uns.html
.
16.          Name and Address of the Data Protection Officer
Within our companies, everyone is responsible for privacy and data protection issues. In addition, we have decided to appoint a data protection officer for each of our companies. To ensure the independence of the data protection officer, we have appointed an external data protection officer:
Mr Stephan Krämer, LL.-M. (Attorney at law, Germany), KINAST Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH, Nordstr. 17a, 50733 Cologne.
You can contact our data protection officer via his website at

Engage Data Protection Policy:
Conditions for processing
We will ensure any use of personal data is justified using at least one of the conditions for processing and this will be specifically documented. All staff who are responsible for processing personal data will be aware of the conditions for processing. The conditions for processing will be available to data subjects in the form of a privacy notice (Above)
Justification for use of personal data
We will process personal data in compliance with all six data protection principles under GDPR and DPA 2018.
Consent
The data that we collect is subject to active consent by you (the data subject). This consent can be revoked at any time.
Data portability
Upon request, a data subject has the right to receive a copy of their data in a structured format. These requests should be processed within one month, provided there is no undue burden and it does not compromise the privacy of other individuals. A data subject may also request that their data is transferred directly to another system. This must be done for free.
Right to be forgotten
A data subject may request that any information held on them is deleted or removed, and any third parties who process or use that data must also comply with the request. An erasure request can only be refused if an exemption applies.
Privacy by design and default
Privacy by design is an approach to projects that promote privacy and data protection compliance from the start. The data protection officer (DPO) will be responsible for conducting Privacy Impact Assessments and ensuring that all projects commence with a privacy plan.
When relevant, and when it does not have a negative impact on the data subject, privacy settings will be set to the most private by default.
Data Storage and Security
We take security of data extremely seriously. Appropriate measures are in place to protect the information that we hold both on and offline so that improper  access, alteration or loss does not take place.
Information is only accessed and processed by appropriately trained staff and volunteers (Area Reps) and project management freelancers.

The following section is an addition to the data protection policy: For Staff members only
International data transfers
No data may be transferred outside of the EEA without first discussing it with the DPO. Specific consent from the data subject must be obtained prior to transferring their data outside the EEA.
Data audit and register
Regular data audits to manage and mitigate risks will inform the data register. This contains information on what data is held, where it is stored, how it is used, who is responsible and any further regulations or retention timescales that may be relevant.
Reporting breaches
All members of staff have an obligation to report actual or potential data protection compliance failures. This allows us to:
Investigate the failure and take remedial steps if necessary
Maintain a register of compliance failures
Notify the Data protection officer (DPO) of any compliance failures that are material either in their own right or as part of a pattern of failures
Monitoring
All Staff and Volunteers must observe this policy. The DPO has overall responsibility for this policy. They will monitor it regularly to make sure it is being adhered to.
Consequences of failing to comply
We take compliance with this policy very seriously. Failure to comply puts both staff, volunteers and the organisation at risk.
The importance of this policy means that failure to comply with any requirement may lead to action detailed in the staff handbook. Please see the relevant section of the staff hand book

and privacy.
Privacy is at the center of everything we do.
Apple Search Ads has been built from the ground up to respect privacy. Our advertising platform is designed to protect users’ information and give them control over how we use it for advertising.
No user tracking or
data sharing
Apple Search Ads doesn’t buy or share users’ personal information with other companies. We don’t track people by linking user or device data collected from Apple apps with user or device data collected from third parties for advertising targeting or measurement. And we don’t share user or device data with data brokers.
Users’ Apple Pay transactions, Health app data, and HomeKit app data are not used by Apple Search Ads to deliver ads.
Easy control for users
Users may view and limit the information Apple uses to deliver relevant ads to them, by choosing whether to enable the Personalized Ads setting. They may also choose whether location-based information can be used to determine which ads they see.
More about ad preferences
Minors protected
Apple Search Ads doesn’t serve ads to any user whose Apple Account is registered to a minor under 13 years of age or set up as a Managed Apple Account. Nor do we collect, use, or disclose any information from them.
Apple Search Ads also doesn’t allow explicit targeting of people whose Apple Account is registered to a user under the age of 18.
Safe content
Every app on the App Store goes through a thorough review, as do the assets used to promote it. Only these approved assets can be used in Apple Search Ads campaigns.
Transparency and
disclosure
All ads have an “Ad” mark so customers can identify the ads as paid placements. They can tap this mark to see the information used to serve the ad.
How we connect customers and advertisers.
Apple Search Ads empowers advertisers, while protecting individuals.
Advertisers have the ability to deliver targeted ads to customer segments, which are groups of people with similar characteristics. Each segment must contain at least 5000 people, which ensures that no customer can be individually targeted.
To ensure we deliver the most relevant ads, Apple Search Ads may use the following:
Account Information
This includes the information a customer includes in their Apple Account.
App Store Data
This includes information provided by developers to define and categorize their apps. It also includes insights derived from non-personal historical search terms, App Store downloads, App Store browsing activity, and in-app purchases made through the App Store.
App Transaction Data
This includes historical information about users’ transactions on the App Store, including apps they’ve downloaded and in-app purchases they’ve made.
Contextual Information
This includes a customer’s device type, iOS version, time of day, device location, search query, and information about the page they’re viewing, or app they're downloading.

How we protect your information
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures
                            to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your
                            personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.
Sensitive and private data exchange between the Site and your browser happens over a SSL

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
                            Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security
                            of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have
                            received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
                            prevent unauthorised access.

Les sites web et services en ligne d'Apple sont susceptibles d'utiliser des "cookies". Les cookies vous permettent d'utiliser des paniers d'achat et de personnaliser votre parcours sur nos sites. Ils nous indiquent quelles pages de nos sites web sont les plus consultées, nous aident à mesurer l'efficacité de la publicité et des recherches sur le Web et nous donnent une idée du comportement des utilisateurs, ce qui nous permet d'améliorer notre communication et nos produits.
Si vous souhaitez désactiver les cookies dans le navigateur web Safari, allez dans Préférences, puis dans le volet Confidentialité et choisissez de bloquer les cookies. Sur votre iPad, iPhone ou iPod touch, allez dans Réglages, puis Safari, puis dans la section Cookies. Pour les autres navigateurs, veuillez consulter votre fournisseur pour savoir comment désactiver les cookies.
Comme les cookies sont très largement présents sur nos sites web, leur désactivation risque de vous empêcher d'utiliser certaines parties de ces sites.
Les cookies auxquels nos sites web ont recours ont été classés à partir des directives réunies dans le guide des cookies publié par la CCI du Royaume-Uni. Ainsi, nous utilisons les catégories suivantes sur nos sites web et pour d'autres services en ligne :
Catégorie 1 – Cookies strictement nécessaires
Ces cookies sont essentiels pour vous permettre de parcourir nos sites web et d'en utiliser les fonctionnalités. Sans ces cookies, des services tels que les paniers d'achat et la facturation électronique ne peuvent pas être assurés.
Catégorie 2 – Cookies de suivi
Ces cookies recueillent des informations sur votre utilisation de nos sites web : par exemple, les pages que vous consultez le plus souvent. Ces données peuvent nous servir à optimiser nos sites web et à les rendre plus faciles à parcourir. Ces cookies permettent également à nos affiliés de savoir si vous avez accédé à l'un de nos sites web à partir de leur site et si votre visite a donné lieu à l'utilisation ou à l'achat d'un produit ou d'un service auprès de nous, en incluant les références du produit ou du service ainsi acheté. Ces cookies ne recueillent aucune information permettant de vous identifier. Toutes les informations qu'ils recueillent sont agrégées et, par conséquent, anonymes.
Catégorie 3 – Cookies de fonctionnalité
Ces cookies permettent à nos sites web de mémoriser les choix que vous avez faits lors de votre visite. Nous pouvons, par exemple, conserver votre localisation géographique dans un cookie afin de veiller à vous présenter notre site web dans la langue de votre pays. Nous pouvons également retenir des préférences telles que la taille et la police des caractères et d'autres éléments configurables. Ces cookies peuvent aussi servir à garder la trace des produits ou des vidéos que vous avez consultés, afin d'éviter toute répétition. Les informations qu'ils recueillent ne permettront pas de vous identifier personnellement, ni de suivre votre activité d'exploration sur des sites web ne dépendant pas d'Apple.

Chez Apple, nous sommes convaincus que le respect de la vie privée est un droit fondamental, et ce droit doit être le même où que vous résidiez dans le monde.
C’est pourquoi nous traitons toutes les données relatives à un individu identifié ou identifiable, ou encore associées ou pouvant être associées à un individu par Apple, comme des « données personnelles », quel que soit le lieu de résidence de l’individu.
Cela signifie que les données qui vous identifient directement, telles que votre nom, sont des données personnelles. Les données qui ne vous identifient pas personnellement mais peuvent raisonnablement être utilisées pour vous identifier, telles que le numéro de série de votre appareil, sont également des données personnelles. Les informations rassemblées sont considérées comme des données non personnelles aux fins du présent Engagement de confidentialité.
Cet Engagement de confidentialité décrit la façon dont
Apple ou une société affiliée Apple
(collectivement, « Apple ») gère les données personnelles, que vous interagissiez avec nous sur nos sites web, via les apps Apple (telles qu’Apple Music ou Cartes) ou en personne (y compris par téléphone ou lorsque vous vous rendez dans un Apple Store). Apple peut également inclure un lien vers des tiers dans ses services ou proposer des apps tierces au téléchargement dans l’App Store. L’Engagement de confidentialité d’Apple ne s’applique pas à la façon dont les tiers définissent ni utilisent les données personnelles. Nous vous invitons à lire leurs politiques de confidentialité et à vous informer sur vos droits en matière de confidentialité avant d’interagir avec eux.
Chez Apple, nous respectons votre droit de connaître, consulter corriger et transférer vos données personnelles, restreindre leur traitement et les supprimer. Nous avons octroyé ce droit à notre clientèle mondiale et si vous décidez d’exercer vos droits en matière de confidentialité, vous ne subirez pas de traitement discriminatoire, ni ne recevrez de niveau de service moindre de la part d’Apple. Lorsque Apple vous demande votre consentement au traitement de vos données personnelles, vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment.
Pour exercer vos droits et choix en matière de confidentialité, y compris dans les cas où un fournisseur de services tiers agit au nom d’Apple, consultez la page Données et confidentialité d’Apple à l’adresse
privacy.apple.com
pour Apple ou
shazam.com/fr/privacy
pour Shazam.
Pour vous aider à protéger la sécurité de vos données personnelles, vous devez vous connecter à votre compte. Votre identité est alors vérifiée. Si vous souhaitez obtenir une copie des données personnelles qui n’est actuellement pas disponible sur la page
privacy.apple.com
, vous pouvez soumettre une demande sur la page
apple.com/fr/privacy/contact
. Vous avez également le droit de déposer une plainte auprès de l’organisme de réglementation concerné.
Nous ne pourrons peut-être pas toujours accéder à votre demande, par exemple si vous nous demandez de supprimer vos données de transaction alors qu’Apple a l’obligation légale de garder une trace de cette transaction. Nous pouvons également refuser d’accéder à une demande si nous pensons que, ce faisant, nous nuirions à notre utilisation légitime des données à des fins de lutte contre la fraude ou de sécurité, par exemple si vous demandez la suppression d’un compte faisant l’objet d’une enquête pour des raisons de problèmes de sécurité. Nous pouvons en outre refuser les demandes mettant en péril la confidentialité de tiers, les demandes abusives ou vexatoires, ou encore les demandes qui seraient extrêmement difficiles à mettre en place ou déraisonnables.
Si vous résidez en Californie et que vous ne pouvez pas accéder à la page Données et confidentialité d’Apple
, vous ou votre agent autorisé pouvez soumettre une demande sur la page
apple.com/fr/privacy/contact
ou par téléphone au 1-800-275-2273.
Pour en savoir plus sur l’exercice de vos droits, consultez la
page support.apple.com/fr-fr/102283
.
Chez Apple, nous pensons que vous pouvez bénéficier d’excellents produits, dans le respect de la confidentialité. Ainsi, nous nous efforçons de
ne collecter que les données personnelles dont nous avons besoin

Les données de santé personnelles incluent également les données pouvant être utilisées pour identifier ou faire des déductions sur l’état de santé d’un individu.

Autres informations que vous nous fournissez.
Données telles que le contenu de vos communications avec Apple, y compris les interactions avec l’assistance client et les contacts par le biais des médias sociaux
Vous n’êtes pas obligé de nous communiquer les données personnelles que nous vous demandons. Cependant, si vous choisissez de ne pas les communiquer, nous ne pourrons pas toujours vous fournir nos produits et services, ou même répondre à vos questions.
Apple peut recevoir des données personnelles vous concernant de la part d’autres
individus
, d’entreprises ou de tiers agissant
selon vos instructions
, de
partenaires
qui collaborent avec nous pour fournir nos produits et services et nous aident à garantir la sécurité et prévenir la fraude, et d’autres
sources légales.
Individus.
Apple peut collecter des données vous concernant auprès d’autres individus, par exemple si cet individu vous a envoyé un produit ou une carte cadeau, vous a invité à participer à un service ou un forum Apple, ou a partagé du contenu avec vous.
Selon vos instructions.
Vous pouvez demander à d’autres individus ou tiers de partager des données avec Apple. Vous pouvez par exemple demander à votre opérateur mobile de partager des données sur le compte de l’opérateur avec Apple afin d’activer ce dernier, ou encore à votre programme fidélité de partager des informations sur votre participation afin de pouvoir gagner des récompenses pour les achats Apple.
Partenaires d’Apple.
Nous pouvons également vérifier les informations que vous nous fournissez, par exemple lorsque vous créez un Compte Apple, avec un tiers à des fins de sécurité et de prévention de la fraude.
Pour activer des fonctionnalités comme la recherche et pour disposer d’une source pour nos modèles d’IA fondamentaux, Apple utilise Applebot, un robot d’indexation, pour indexer les informations publiquement disponibles sur Internet.

Chez Apple, nous comprenons l’importance de sauvegarder les données personnelles des enfants, à savoir les
individus de moins de 13 ans ou l’âge équivalent spécifié par la loi de votre juridiction
. C’est pourquoi nous avons mis en place des processus et protections supplémentaires afin de préserver la sécurité des données personnelles des enfants.
Pour accéder à certains services Apple, un enfant doit posséder un Compte Apple pour enfant. Un Compte Apple pour enfant peut être créé par un
parent
ou, dans le cas d’un Compte Apple géré, par l’
établissement d’enseignement de l’enfant
.
Parents.
Pour créer un compte pour un enfant, les parents doivent consulter la
Divulgation des données personnelles de la famille pour les enfants
, qui décrit la façon dont Apple traite les données personnelles des enfants. S’ils donnent leur accord, les parents doivent fournir à Apple un consentement parental vérifiable.
Établissements d’enseignement.

Ces technologies nous permettent de mieux comprendre le comportement des utilisateurs, notamment à des fins de sécurité et de prévention de la fraude, nous indiquent quelles parties de nos sites web sont les plus visitées, et facilitent et mesurent l’efficacité des annonces et recherches Internet.
Cookies de communications.
Ces cookies nous permettent de maintenir le trafic réseau vers et depuis les systèmes d’Apple, notamment en nous aidant à détecter les erreurs.
Cookies strictement nécessaires.
Ces cookies sont configurés comme nécessaires pour fournir une fonctionnalité ou un service spécifique auquel vous avez accédé ou que vous avez demandé. Ils nous permettent par exemple d’afficher nos sites web au format et dans la langue appropriés, d’authentifier et de vérifier vos transactions, et de préserver le contenu de votre panier lorsque vous faites des achats en ligne sur
apple.com/fr
.
Autres cookies.
Ces cookies nous permettent de comprendre la façon dont les visiteurs interagissent avec nos sites web et nos services en ligne, notamment en nous aidant à mesurer l’efficacité des annonces et recherches Internet. Nous utilisons également ces cookies pour nous souvenir des choix que vous faites lorsque vous naviguez, afin de vous offrir une expérience personnalisée.
Si vous préférez qu’Apple n’utilise pas de cookies, vous avez la possibilité de les désactiver. Si vous utilisez le navigateur web Safari et que vous souhaitez désactiver les cookies, sélectionnez « Bloquer tous les cookies » dans les réglages de confidentialité de Safari. Si vous utilisez un autre navigateur, consultez votre fournisseur pour savoir comment désactiver les cookies. Certaines fonctionnalités du site web Apple peuvent ne plus être disponibles si tous les cookies sont désactivés.
Outre les cookies, nous utilisons d’autres technologies qui nous permettent d’atteindre des objectifs similaires.
Dans certains de nos e-mails, nous utilisons des « URL de destination » liées au contenu du site web Apple. Lorsque vous cliquez sur l’une de ces URL, vous êtes transféré vers un autre serveur avant d’arriver sur la page de destination de notre site web. Nous suivons ces données de clic pour déterminer l’intérêt porté à certains sujets et mesurer l’efficacité de nos communications avec vous. Si vous préférez ne pas être suivi de cette façon, vous ne devez pas cliquer sur les liens texte ou graphiques figurant dans les e-mails.
Nous traitons généralement les données que nous collectons à l’aide de cookies et de technologies similaires, comme des informations non personnelles.
Toutefois, si les adresses IP (Internet Protocol) ou des identifiants similaires sont considérés comme des données personnelles par la loi locale, nous traitons également ces identifiants comme des données personnelles dans ces régions. En outre, nous combinons parfois les données non personnelles collectées grâce à ces technologies avec d’autres données personnelles en notre possession. Dans ce cas, nous traitons les données combinées comme des données personnelles aux fins du présent Engagement de confidentialité.
Les annonces diffusées par la plateforme publicitaire d’Apple peuvent apparaître sur l’App Store, Apple News, Bourse et l’app Apple TV en fonction de votre pays ou région. La plateforme publicitaire d’Apple ne suit pas votre activité, ce qui signifie qu’elle ne lie pas les données des utilisateurs ou des appareils collectées à partir de nos apps aux données des utilisateurs ou des appareils collectées auprès de tiers à des fins de publicité ciblée ou de mesure publicitaire, et ne partage pas les données des utilisateurs ou des appareils avec les courtiers en données.
Si vous ne souhaitez pas recevoir d’annonces ciblées en fonction de vos centres d’intérêt de la part de la plateforme publicitaire d’Apple dans ces apps, vous pouvez choisir de désactiver l’option Publicités personnalisées, ce qui permettra à votre Compte Apple de ne pas recevoir d’annonces de ce type, et ce quel que soit l’appareil que vous utilisez.

Microsoft Edge
Windows 10
Le nouveau Microsoft Edge
vous aide à naviguer sur le web, faire des recherches, acheter en ligne et bien plus encore. Comme tous les navigateurs modernes, Microsoft Edge vous permet de recueillir et de conserver des données spécifiques sur votre appareil, comme les cookies, et vous permet de nous envoyer des informations, comme l’historique de navigation, afin de rendre l’expérience aussi riche, rapide et personnalisée que possible.
Lorsque nous recueillons des données, nous voulons nous assurer d’avoir votre accord. Certains s’inquiètent de voir les données de leur historique de navigation collectées. C’est pourquoi nous vous indiquons quelles sont les données qui sont conservées sur votre appareil ou celles que nous recueillons. Vous avez la possibilité de contrôler les données collectées. Pour plus d’informations sur la confidentialité dans Microsoft Edge, nous vous conseillons de consulter notre
Déclaration de confidentialité

Quelles données sont collectées ou conservées, et pourquoi ?
Microsoft utilise les données de diagnostic pour améliorer ses produits et services. Nous utilisons ces données pour mieux comprendre la façon dont nos produits fonctionnent et les aspects à améliorer.
Microsoft Edge recueille un ensemble de données de diagnostic obligatoires pour maintenir Microsoft Edge sécurisé, mis à jour et fonctionnant comme attendu. Microsoft croit en la réduction de la collecte des informations et la met en application. Nous nous efforçons de rassembler uniquement les informations dont nous avons besoin et de ne les conserver que tant qu’elles sont nécessaires pour fournir un service ou pour une analyse. En outre, vous pouvez contrôler si les données de diagnostic facultatives associées à votre appareil sont communiquées à Microsoft afin de résoudre les problèmes liés aux produits et de contribuer à améliorer les produits et services Microsoft.
Lorsque vous utilisez des fonctionnalités et des services dans Microsoft Edge, les données de diagnostic concernant votre utilisation de ces fonctionnalités sont envoyées à Microsoft. Microsoft Edge enregistre sur votre appareil votre historique de navigation, composé d’informations sur des sites web que vous consultez. En fonction de vos paramètres, l’historique de navigation est envoyé à Microsoft, ce qui nous permet de rechercher et de résoudre les problèmes, ainsi que d’améliorer nos produits et services pour tous les utilisateurs. Vous pouvez gérer la collecte de données de diagnostic facultatives dans le navigateur en sélectionnant

. Cela inclut les données de test de nouvelles expériences. Pour terminer la modification de ce paramètre, redémarrez Microsoft Edge.
L’activation de ce paramètre permet de partager ce diagnostic facultatif avec Microsoft à partir d’autres applications qui utilisent Microsoft Edge, par exemple, une application de diffusion de vidéo en continu qui héberge la plateforme web Microsoft Edge pour diffuser la vidéo. La plateforme web Microsoft Edge envoient des informations sur votre utilisation de la plateforme web et sur les sites que vous consultez dans l’application à Microsoft.  Cette collecte de données est déterminée par votre paramètre de données de diagnostic facultatives dans les paramètres Confidentialité et services de Microsoft Edge.

Depuis le
6 mars 2024,
les données de diagnostic Microsoft Edge sont collectées séparément des données de diagnostic Windows sur les appareils Windows 10 (version 22H2 et ultérieures) et Windows 11 (versions 23H2 et ultérieures) dans l’Espace économique européen. Pour ces versions de Windows et sur toutes les autres plateformes, vous pouvez modifier vos paramètres dans Microsoft Edge en sélectionnant

. Lorsque vous commencez la saisie, les informations que vous entrez dans la barre d’adresse sont envoyées à votre moteur de recherche par défaut afin de vous proposer immédiatement des suggestions de recherche et de sites web.
Lorsque vous utilisez la navigation InPrivate ou le mode Invité, Microsoft Edge collecte des informations sur la façon dont vous utilisez le navigateur en fonction de vos paramètres de données de diagnostic Windows ou de vos paramètres de confidentialité Microsoft Edge, mais les suggestions automatiques sont désactivées et les informations sur les sites web que vous visitez ne sont pas collectées. Microsoft Edge supprime votre historique de navigation, vos cookies et vos données de site, ainsi que les mots de passe, les adresses et les données de formulaire lorsque vous fermez toutes les fenêtres InPrivate. Vous pouvez démarrer une nouvelle session InPrivate en sélectionnant

Microsoft Edge intègre également des fonctionnalités permettant de sécuriser vos données et votre présence en ligne. Windows Defender SmartScreen bloque automatiquement les sites web et le téléchargement de contenus signalés comme malveillants. Windows Defender SmartScreen compare l’adresse de la page web consultée à une liste d’adresses de pages web que Microsoft juge légitimes stockée sur votre appareil. Les adresses qui ne figurent pas dans la liste de votre appareil et celles des fichiers que vous téléchargez sont envoyées à Microsoft et comparées à une liste régulièrement mise à jour de pages web et de téléchargements qui ont été signalés à Microsoft comme non sécurisés ou suspects.
Pour accélérer les tâches fastidieuses, telles que le remplissage de formulaires ou la saisie de mots de passe, Microsoft Edge peut, dans cette optique, enregistrer vos informations. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser cette fonctionnalité, Microsoft Edge conserve les informations sur votre appareil. Si vous avez activé la synchronisation pour le remplissage des formulaires comme les adresses ou les mots de passe, ces informations sont envoyées au cloud Microsoft et sont stockées avec votre compte Microsoft pour être synchronisées avec toutes vos versions de Microsoft Edge connectées. Vous pouvez gérer ces données à partir de

Pour intégrer votre expérience de navigation à d’autres activités que vous effectuez sur votre appareil, Microsoft Edge partage votre historique de navigation avec Microsoft Windows via son indexeur. Ces informations sont stockées localement sur l’appareil. Il inclut des URL, une catégorie dans laquelle l’URL peut être pertinente, comme « le plus visité », « récemment visité » ou « récemment fermé », ainsi qu’une fréquence ou une récurrence relative au sein de chaque catégorie. Les sites web que vous visitez en mode InPrivate ne seront pas partagés. Ces informations sont ensuite disponibles pour d’autres applications sur l’appareil, telles que le menu Démarrer ou la barre des tâches.

Pour éviter que des musiques ou des vidéos ne soient copiées, certains sites web de diffusion en continu stockent des données de gestion des droits numériques (DRM, Digital Rights Management) sur votre appareil, et notamment un identifiant (ID) unique et des licences multimédia. Lorsque vous accédez à ces sites web, ce dernier récupère les données DRM pour s’assurer que vous êtes autorisé à utiliser le contenu en question.
Microsoft Edge conserve également des cookies sur votre appareil : il s’agit de fichiers de petite taille qui sont téléchargés sur votre appareil lorsque vous naviguez sur le web. De nombreux sites utilisent des cookies pour stocker des informations sur vos préférences et vos paramètres, par exemple, les articles présents dans votre panier pour les achats en ligne, afin que vous ne soyez pas obligé de les ajouter à chaque visite. Certains sites web utilisent également des cookies pour recueillir des informations sur votre activité en ligne afin de vous envoyer des publicités axées sur vos centres d’intérêt. Microsoft Edge vous donne la possibilité d’effacer les cookies et d’empêcher les sites web d’enregistrer ceux-ci à l’avenir.
Microsoft Edge envoie des demandes Ne pas me suivre aux sites web si le paramètre
Envoyer des demandes Ne pas me suivre
est activé. Cependant, les sites web ont parfois la possibilité de suivre vos activités même lorsqu’une demande Ne pas suivre est envoyée.

button. This will disable ad blocker on that site. In the same popup, you can also enable/disable the Tracker blocker, or click the gear icon to be taken to the settings page for ad blocker.
Opera’s ad blocker pauses when you visit a whitelisted website and resumes when you navigate to another website, allowing for an uninterrupted browsing experience.
The whitelisted website’s domain is added to your ad blocking exceptions list. Read below to learn how to manage exceptions for Opera’s ad blocker.
Managing filter lists for Opera’s ad blocker
You can choose which filter lists Opera’s ad blocker uses when the feature is enabled. EasyList and NoCoin are enabled by default. To manage lists in Opera’s ad blocker:
Go to
Settings
.
In
Privacy protection
, under
Block ads
, click
Manage lists
.
Check the boxes next to the lists you want enabled for ad blocker.
Opera updates your selected lists automatically. You can update the lists manually by clicking the
Update
button at the top of the page.
These lists, also known as filter lists, contain rules that tell ad blockers which content is likely to be an ad. The most popular and commonly used list for removing ads on international websites is EasyList. Opera includes additional lists, such as EasyPrivacy, NoCoin, and lists for multiple languages, in order to remove ads.
NoCoin
is a cryptocurrency mining protection filter list which stops crytpojacking scripts from running on your computer. Read more about Opera’s

VPN
Normally, your browser connects directly to websites, allowing websites to identify your IP address and approximate location. With VPN, you connect to websites via a VPN (virtual private network) server. As a result, your apparent location changes to the location of the server. To enable VPN:
Go to
Settings
.
Click
Advanced
in the left sidebar, and click
Features
.
Under
VPN,
turn on
Enable VPN
.
When you enable VPN, it starts automatically, and a VPN
badge
appears in the combined address and search bar. Click on the badge, and you will see an on/off switch, information about the amount of data transferred, the virtual location, and the virtual IP address.
From the point of view of websites, your browser is now located in the region given by the virtual location. To change your virtual location, select a region from the list. If you do not choose a region, you are automatically assigned an
optimal location
. To turn off VPN, flip the switch in the badge.
Because the connection from your browser to the VPN server is encrypted, even if the local network is not, VPN enhances your privacy on the local network. You can hide your browsing activities from other users of that network.
To enhance your privacy with regard to websites, making it more difficult for them to track you, you need a combination of features. The issue is
cookies
. Even if you disguise your location, websites can still identify you if they have set a cookie. Notice, however, that by
blocking ads
you block the source of many tracking cookie. At the end of a
private browsing
session, when you close the browser, all cookies from that session are deleted.
VPN is a free service, and the amount of data you are allowed to transfer is unlimited.
Private window
Private browsing ensures that your internet history and activity data is removed as soon as you close all private windows.
To browse privately on Windows and Linux, go to
Menu > New private window
.
To browse privately on Mac, select
File > New Private Window
(
Ctrl+Shift+N
).
When you close all private windows, Opera will clear the following associated data:
Browsing history
Items in cache
Cookies
After being closed, a private tab or window cannot be recovered from the
Recently Closed
list in the tab menu.
While private windows do not leave any record of the websites you visit, if you deliberately save data – for example, if you save an item to your Speed Dial, save a password, or download a file – it will still be visible after the window is closed.
Clear browsing data
By default, Opera stores certain browsing data to help speed up connections, load common page elements, and improve your interaction with the sites you visit. You may wish to remove traces of your browsing habits by clearing your browsing data. To clear browsing data:
Go to
Settings
.
Click
Advanced
in the left sidebar, and click
Privacy & security
.
Under
Privacy and security
, click
Clear browsing data
.
Select a time range and the types of data you wish to clear, and click
Clear data
.
Browsing history
– A list of sites you have visited.
Download history
– A record of the files you’ve downloaded. Clearing this will not delete the file you downloaded, only the record of where and when.
News usage data
– Information on the frequency and the length of time you spend on a news article from the personal news page, which is used to customize what news you see.
Cookies and other site data
– Data from websites you visit which is stored on your computer, such as site preferences and login status.
Cached images and files
– Data stored on your computer by applications or websites to make processes and site loading faster. Should be cleared periodically.
Passwords and other sign-in data
– Data related to logging into websites and applications. Allows you to be signed-in automatically.
Autofill form data
– Information like credit-card numbers, names and phone numbers, which you can choose to store on your computer in order to have forms filled in automatically.
Site settings
– Permission data for websites, such as whether they can access your microphone or send you cookies.
Hosted app data
– Data stored by extensions you have installed in your browser. Clearing this data will reset the extension to its default.
Clearing your browsing history will delete any stored location information about the pages you have viewed and the times you accessed them.
Clearing download history will empty Opera’s record of the files you’ve downloaded through the browser. This will not delete the file from your local machine, only the record of when and where you downloaded it.
Deleting cookies and other site data will remove any tracked site data. Read
more about managing cookies
.
Emptying your browser’s cache will delete any temporarily stored data from websites. The cache is used to briefly store page elements such as images or search queries. Cached data also helps reduce loading times when you wish to access a recently visited site. Emptying cache will clear up space on you local disk.
Clearing data from hosted apps will delete any data stored by extensions you have installed in the browser. For example, if you installed a weather extension on Speed Dial and set your location in its settings, clearing this data will reset the extension to its default and you will have to tell the extension your location again.
Note:
Take care not to erase useful data inadvertently. If you are not already familiar with it, try private browsing. The data for private browsing is automatically cleared when you close all private windows.
Managing how Opera stores private data may be useful, as an alternative to clearing all private data. Read

Security badges
Opera warns you about suspicious pages by checking the page you request against a database of known
phishing
and
malware
websites. To protect yourself when entering sensitive information, always look for the
lock in the security badge to the left of the combined address and search bar.
Badges indicate details about the page you are viewing. When a badge appears in your combined address and search bar, click it to see more information, including security certificates and more.
Icon
Indicates…
Compressed connection
Ads are blocked
Camera access

Fraud or malware warning

When the connection is secure, a lock is displayed in the security badge, implying that no one else can read the information that passes between you and the site. Opera uses certificates to verify the identity of the site owners. A lock means there is good encryption between you and the recipient, and the recipient’s identity has been verified.
If a website is blacklisted, you will be presented with a warning page, and you can decide whether to visit the website or to go back safely to the previous page. Fraud and malware protection does not cause any delay in the opening of pages.
Manage security certificates
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a widely used technology that provides encrypted communication and identity assurance on the Internet. Security certificates are used to verify the ownership of Internet domains. If you see a black padlock security badge in your combined address and search bar, then according to your operating system’s configuration, you are securely connected to the website. However, it is still your responsibility to make sure that the address is correct. When in doubt, type the address by hand.
If you’d like more information about a site’s security certificate, click on the security badge and click the
Certificate (Valid)
link. Opera will provide the certificate’s issuer, the type of certificate, and whether the issuer is publicly-known and valid.
Publicly-known issuers and their certificates are validated against a number of security and identity checks. Opera will warn you if some part of a publicly-known issuer’s certificate is questionable. You may choose to proceed but Opera cannot guarantee your security.
To see which HTTPS/TLS certificates are used by your Opera browser and how Opera handles them:
Go to
Settings
.
Click
Advanced
in the left sidebar, and click
Privacy & security
.
Under
Privacy and security
, click
Manage certificates
.
A note about local certificate issuers
Some connections can be certified by certificates from local issuers, either from apps on your machine or other non-public sources (such as a local intranet). These issuers can be used to verify secured connections in the browser. Most of these connections are valid. For example, debugging applications, third-party security scanning, and parental filters may rely on locally-issued certificates.
Connections certified by certificates from local issuers aren’t screened by the same security standards as publicly-known issuers and certificates. Such screening is too strict and may not allow connections to work as intended. Malware or viruses may use these certificates to view encrypted information or inject ads.
If you wish, you can configure Opera to warn you about public sites that use certificates from local issuers. If you continue to browse on these connections, be aware that some security measures, such as certificate pinning and Certificate Transparency, will be disabled for all such connections during your browsing session.

Invalid certificate warnings in Opera
If Opera cannot verify the identity of the server for a website you wish to visit, you will see this pop-up. Click
Show certificate
to review the certificate yourself. When reviewing the certificate, check that the certificate’s validity date is current and that the issuer of the certificate is trusted.
Click
Continue anyway
to proceed to the website.
If you do not trust the server or the certificate and you wish to not proceed to the website, click
Cancel.
A note about Extended Validation (EV) certificates
The best guarantee of a website’s identity is provided by Extended Validation (EV) certificates. Extended Validation means that the details of the organization buying the certificate have been audited by an accountable, third-party entity, who can therefore verify that the certificate owner is who it claims to be. EV websites are indicated by a black
security badge
with a padlock in the address field.
Extended Validation certificates are designed to endorse a company’s validity as a reliable, rather than transient, business. For example, to obtain a certificate, a company must provide three years of tax records and other financial information to the Certificate Authority. This certification provides peace of mind and security for Internet shoppers.
Opera has already implemented procedures and processes for EV certification and is at the forefront of complying with standards. We have built-in procedures to automatically verify that everything in a certificate for a website is correct when someone visits a page on the site and that the certificate has not been revoked.
Tell sites to not track your activity
Most sites track your behavior while you visit them. If you do not like this idea, Opera can send an additional header with every request: “DNT: 1”. This is a flag to websites that the user does not want to be tracked. Some countries have DNT legislation that will legally protect your request and most well-behaved websites will respect this additional header.
You can set Opera to tell sites you prefer to opt-out of online behavioral tracking. To set this:
Go to
Settings
.
Click
Advanced
in the left sidebar, and scroll down to
Privacy & security
.
Click
Cookies and other site data
.
Under
Cookies and other site data
, turn on
Send a “Do Not Track” request with your browsing traffic

A note about phishing and malware
Opera’s fraud and malware Protection warns you about suspicious web pages and is enabled by default. It checks the requested page against several databases of known phishing and malware websites, called blacklists. Although it is not possible to totally eliminate the risk of encountering an unidentified phishing or malware website, the risk is minimized.
Note that checking against the database does not delay the opening of web pages.
Phishing
The growth of Internet commerce has given online criminals an opportunity to steal your passwords, your credit card numbers, and other personal information by impersonating authority figures from your bank or other institutions you frequent. This is known as phishing.
You will be encouraged to log in and “verify” your customer information: in other words, to reveal your password, credit card number, or other private data. The best defense against this threat is to be aware of the problem and to be alert when transacting business online.
Malware
For the same reason that you have anti-virus software installed, you may want protection from websites that distribute viruses or other malicious software, collectively known as malware. The concept of malware encompasses not just viruses, but also scripts that may run automatically when you load a web page.
