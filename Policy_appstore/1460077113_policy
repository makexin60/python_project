Introduction
This is the Privacy Policy of Coupert ("Coupert", "us", "our", "we"). By using Coupert, you agree that you have read and understand the following policy, which shows how we use your information, and what options you have to make changes to or request the deletion of information submitted to us.
Coupert, complying with the requirements of the USA Data Protection Act 1998, takes your privacy seriously. Several security systems are used to protect your information from unauthorized use. The privacy policy describes what kind of personal information we collect and how we use it. See this privacy policy below to learn about our privacy policies.
I. Information that Coupert collects
We may collect personal identification information from users in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps, and referring pages. However, none of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. All of the information we collect is used for routine administration and maintenance purposes.
Please read this Privacy Policy very carefully. We may modify our Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will publish it immediately, so please regularly check our policies. However, if you do not agree to our practices, please do not register, subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with the service. Your use of the service is also subject to our Terms of Use.
1. Information that Coupert collects
Coupert collects information in several ways from affiliates and different parts of our network of web sites. Even if you are only a Visitor (meaning that you are using the Coupert service but have not yet registered for a Coupert account and not participating in the Rewards Program), we may still collect your Transaction Information and Shopping Information, as further explained herein, when you shop online with Coupert.
a. Personal Information
When you use Coupert, you may provide us with certain personal information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, email address, Facebook username, telephone number, or any other form of communication you wish to provide. You provide us with this information when you register for an account (including your username and password) to make a purchase on online websites using Coupert, or send us customer service related requests. In addition, Coupert will use your email address and some shipping information for delivering service and verifying the authenticity of the orders. In order to improve Coupert, we also collect your personal information if you submit some comments or any other user comments.We make and keep records when we provide you support or assistance on our services. We may also collect information about how you interact with our various services (or parts of our services) or third party content you see on our apps and sites.

We use third-party payment processors (e.g. Paypal) to process your personal financial information such as your name, phone number, address, zip code, and credit card/bank account information. For the avoidance of doubt, Coupert does not collect or process your private financial information.
d. Shopping Information
To support the Coupert community, we may collect limited shopping data about deals or coupon codes, which means Coupert members share real-time information with the rest of the community to help everyone save time and money.

When collecting information about our customers or visitors of our website, we are, under European Union (â€œEU") data protection laws, qualified as â€œdata controller". This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal data about you.
We collect information about you when you fill in a sign up or contact form on our website or send us an email. We may also receive your personal data from third parties, when you express your interest for our services to them.
We collect information by automated means. When you visit our website, view one of our advertisements on a third party-owned website, or read our marketing newsletters, we automatically collect information about you via cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. These are small files associated with information that your browser or our servers will save and return as part of your use of the website and the services for purposes such as saving your login session between visits, remembering your display preferences, tracking your use of the website, and for audience measurement purposes. For more information on our use of cookies, read
our cookies notice

We collect two types of information about you: personal data and non-personal data.
Personal data. This is information that lets us know who you are. This includes the information you provide us when registering to use the platform (i.e. your name, company name, email address, postal address, other contact information you share with us, associated domain name and credit card information). Your login credentials are also personal data. This category also includes information tied to your identity that you provide us through other means, such as emails to our support team.
In addition, and in the context of using our services, namely creating and sending emails, we have access to the information contained in the subject and content of the emails that you send out, as well as the email contacts you send to via our services.
The data you submit should not include any sensitive personal data, such as Government identifiers (i.e. social security, driving licence, or taxpayer identification numbers), complete credit card or complete personal bank card numbers, medical records or particulars connected with applications for care or treatment associated with private individuals.
Non-personal data. This is information that doesnâ€™t let us determine your identity. This generally comes from your use of the services after registering on our website. Non-personal data includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregation) any personal data.
If you are a visitor of our website, we use your personal and non-personal data to engage with you and support live chat conversations on the website.

We may use your non-personal data to enhance the services, for instance through web analytics or troubleshooting. We may also use aggregated or depersonalized information to promote our services, such as by citing usage statistics.
We collect your personal data because we need it to perform a contract we have signed with you or because you have taken steps to enter into a contract with us (for instance, when you fill in a contact form to request information about our services or when you sign up for an account). Otherwise, we collect personal data based on your consent for that specific purpose, and in limited purposes under legitimate interests (for example, to enable us to foster and develop our relationship (with the use of a customer relationship management system), and to perform credit checks or for verification of data and payment details).
Except for the limited circumstances we describe here or in an applicable agreement or our Terms of service, we do not share your personal data with third parties. When we need to provide your personal data to third parties, we will only share it to the extent necessary to provide you with our services, and we ensure that we have in place data protection requirements with these third parties (including standard contractual clauses as well as the requisite technical and organisational measures).
We may also share your personal data as required or permitted by law and as to optimally provide our services through third party providers as described below.
Hosting Services:
We host the website and operate the platform using third parties, including Google Cloud Platform, AWSÂ®, MacStadium and RackspaceÂ®. Your platform will be hosted from their data centers throughout the United States or Europe, based on where you have selected to deploy our services (no transfers between these separate data center locations occur).
Payment Providers:
We use StripeÂ®, Chargify, Aria, and Authorize.net to process subscription payments, and therefore provide them with the personal data required to charge your credit card and maintain any payment mandate information as law requires.
Website functionalities and optimization:
We may use third-party services either embedded into our website (such as Drift, Optimizely, VWO, Segmentâ„¢, Split.io and GoogleÂ® Analytics) or outside of it (such as GitHubÂ®, Unbounce and TwitterÂ®) to communicate with you or to enhance the function of the website and the services, and for product development and optimization.
Customer engagement:
We use third-party service providers and platforms (such as Gainsight, Customer.io, Looker, Snowflake, Salesforce, Uservoice, Zapier, and Zendesk) for customer engagement, customer chat, product feedback and customer support ticketing.
IP addresses:
We may share your contact information with ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) for the purposes of fulfilling your request to re-assign the dedicated IP addresses.
While we provide these third parties with no more information than what is necessary to enable them to provide the services to us, any information that you provide these services providers independently is subject to their respective privacy policies and practices.
In no case do we sell, share or rent out your contacts to third parties, nor use them for any purpose other than those set forth in this policy.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities or regulatory bodies, including to meet law enforcement requirements, in the case of a court order, a summons to appear in court or any other similar requisition from a government or the judiciary, or to establish or defend a legal application.
Our US company, Mailgun Technologies, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
Additionally, we will provide information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
We keep your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide our services to you (unless otherwise required by law).
If you would like us to cease all of the described uses of your personal data, you may delete your account at any time from the Account Settings section of our Dashboard. This will delete your personal data from our records (within a maximum of ninety (90) days), and we will make no further use of it.
