Digital News Provider of the Year 2024
Last updated February 2025
Every day Kiwis like you visit our websites, engage with our apps and purchase services from us. We want to help you understand the data that we collect from you and how we use it, and how you can control this information while using our services.
Your privacy is important to us. Whenever Stuff collects and uses personal information from you, we comply with New Zealand's Privacy Act, which is designed to protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect, and what we can do with it. It includes sections on:
privacy law in New Zealand;
the data we collect and how we use it;
how we rely on data as a business;
how we deal with personal information.
Some key things to know
1. This privacy policy describes how Stuff Limited and its affiliates, including Stuff Digital Limited and Neighbourly Limited, (we, us or our) collect and use data, including personal information when you use our services, such as:
subscribing to a Newspaper or Magazine;
our websites, like stuff.co.nz, neighbourly.co.nz and mags4gifts.co.nz;

our email newsletters;
becoming a Stuff or Neighbourly Member and posting in the comments section on Stuff/Neighbourly;
where you are a participant of an event managed by Stuff Events;

anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this privacy policy.
2. We aim to explain the rights and choices you have in relation to personal information that we collect and process about you.
3. Information you post on our website will be publicly available for use by us and any third party using our services.
4. Our
Cookies Policy
provides more information on how we use cookies. You will find information about how you can manage your device and browser preferences, and opt-out of certain types of tracking.
Privacy law in New Zealand
Our data practices are subject to the New Zealand Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 2020 (the Privacy Act).
From time to time, when we are conducting our editorial activities, we may also handle personal information relying on the news media exemption in the Privacy Act. Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the New Zealand Media Council Privacy Principles.
If you require more information about the collection and use of personal information in the course of our journalism, please visit the Privacy Commissioner website at
http://privacy.org.nz
or the Media Council at
www.mediacouncil.org.nz
.
What data do we collect?
Data provided by you
We may collect, store and process data, including personal information provided by you when accessing or using our websites, apps and services, such as:
Information collected from you: personal information provided by you when you interact with us, such as when you sign up or register to use our services, when you purchase a service from us, when you are a participant at an event or promotion managed by us, information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys or directly to our representatives from time to time;
Information disclosed by you: we offer the Stuff or Neighbourly Members the ability to post content publicly. We and others may read, collect and use any personal information when you choose to post information on one of our websites;
Data created by using our services
We may collect, store and process data when you are using our websites, apps and services, such as:
Device and location information: we may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our websites and mobile applications (including your IP address, your location, your operating system, your browser, your device language, the URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and other usage information), aggregated data. More information is detailed in our
Cookies Policy and Targeting and Tracking Policy
;
Usage information: anonymous information collected through cookies and other tracking software. More information is detailed in our
Cookies Policy and Targeting and Tracking Policy
;
Advertisers and other ad platforms: anonymous and inferred information provided by our advertising and marketing partners, collected via cookies , tags and other information from partners who you have consented to share that information with us.
Data from other sources
Third parties: someone who has provided us with your information, such as via a gift subscription, credit reporting or law enforcement agencies, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, vendors who provide us with address verification services, or contractors and business partners;
Affiliates: we may receive data from our related companies such as Neighbourly.
Stuff may combine the data received from these sources with data in our control.
How we rely on data as a business
Our websites make available news, commentary and other media content produced or curated by us. Much of this media content is made available without access charge or access restriction, made possible by online advertising that we display in conjunction with that media content. We are able to produce and make available our media content at no charge to you, only by also providing you with targeted advertising. This is a key source of revenue for us: if we could not do this we could not fund quality journalism and provide free media content. We want you to understand how we provide you with targeted advertising while being fair and responsible and respectful of your privacy.
We are able to increase the value of our advertising by enabling advertisers to target groups of our users that are inferred to share interests or preferences. This might be, for example, a shared interest in bicycling, or in beach holidays. These groups are called 'audience segments'.
We offer targeting of users' browsing behaviour, interest, intent and location, but we do not offer any personal identifier information. We sell the ability for advertisers to use particular audience segments to target advertisements to groups of our users where the users are not reasonably identifiable by the advertisers and the advertisements are intended to be relevant to inferred interests and preferences of segments of users.
Because the audience segment is inferred to share a common interest or preference, the advertisement is worth more to that advertiser. Targeted advertising can occur without those advertisers at any time knowing being able to identify the individuals within that audience segment.
For more information please see our
Tracking Policy here
.
How do we use the data that we collect?
We use, store and process information about you for the following purposes:
1.
to provide you our products and services, such as:
making Stuff services or products available to you;
arranging access to your account, and allowing you to personalise your account;
providing in-app features such as weather information;
providing you with news, information or advice about our existing and new products and services; and
providing customer services to you including by email, mail or telephone, and sending service-related messages (e.g. a change in our terms and conditions),

to provide customer support such as:
looking at website traffic, analysing trends and helping us build a view of how the site is working. These insights are important because they help us to make the site better for you and our partners.
3.
for marketing, such as:
to market our services and products; and
to market our affiliates; or partners; services and products. Even if we market services and products from our third party partners we do not sell or share personal data with such partners for their own direct marketing unless we have your consent,

including where you make a publicly available post or comments using our services;

to conduct competitions or promotions on behalf of Stuff and selected third parties;
to provide business data to third parties if you have authorised us to do so;

as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act); or
7.
with your consent.
Membership (Stuff Account) and Registration Data
As a registered member, we want to make sure we make your experience as relevant to you as possible, so we use all the information we collect about you whenever you use any of our services and we combine it to create a profile about you. This might mean using some or all of the information we know about our audience to create segments for advertising. We do this without sharing any personal information outside of Stuff. This allows us to better understand your preferences, to personalise your experiences when you use any of our services and to make sure you see more relevant content and ads.
If we do any matching with information provided by another party and we need to use a specialist third party provider, we won't share the results of that matching process with any other party, unless your information has been aggregated and anonymised.
When you register for or sign up to any of our services, we may assign you a unique ID number. This gives you a better experience because it means we can still recognise you if you sign in using the same account on a new device or through a different app
We may also display ads we think you’ll be interested in when you are using Google Search. We do this through Google’s Customer Match tool. You can manage your Google Ad settings here:
https://myadcenter.google.com/controls
Stuff may opt to use registration data to reach you on LinkedIn with relevant advertising based on what we know about your interests. You can manage your LinkedIn Ad settings here:

We may not be able to provide you with information about products and services that you may want, including information about discounts sales or special promotions; or

Make a privacy complaint
We're keen to work with New Zealanders to get their privacy queries and complaints sorted quickly and fairly. Before you complain to us, you need to
complain directly to the business or organisation that you feel has breached your privacy.
If you haven’t been able to work out your privacy issue with them,
then you can complain to us
. We aim to ensure that you're treated fairly, whatever your background or circumstances. We work in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1993.

We review all the complaints we receive. If we can resolve them quickly, we will. If your case requires a complicated or comprehensive investigation, then owing to high volumes, the wait time for an investigator is up to six months.
Privacy Amendment Bill: what you need to know
The Privacy Amendment Bill is making its way through Parliament, and we know organisations are starting to think about how this will impact them. We’ve put together key information on the Bill, which we’ll update as it progresses.
Read more about our upcoming guidance, how you can be involved or ask for what you need, and what the timing looks like for this work

Agencies: report a data breach
If you're an organisation and have a privacy breach that is likely to cause anyone serious harm, you are legally required to notify us and any affected persons as soon as you can.
As a guide, our expectation is that a breach notification should be made to our Office no later than 72 hours after agencies are aware of a notifiable privacy breach.
Work out whether you need to notify us

Commissioner to proceed with biometrics privacy code
The Privacy Commissioner will proceed with developing a privacy code of practice to create specific rules for agencies using biometrics.
We’ve made several important changes to the draft code since our last consultation and are giving people a further chance to have their say. Consultation is open now until 14 March 2025.
