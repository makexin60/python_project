Privacy Policy
Our
privacy policy
is very
          simple/uncomplicated: we (
PokerCruncher,
            LLC
) collect/store
absolutely
            no personal data
of our apps' users.
For example, if you use any version of our
PokerCruncher
app, your
personal hand ranges and
            scenarios
will be stored
completely
            inside your app on your device
, and nowhere outside of your
          app/device.
We
do not track
location-info.
or
app-usage-info.
or any
          other
personal information/data
of our apps' users. Frankly, we have other, more
          important/productive, things to spend our time on / work on that are
          much more beneficial for our customers and for us, like improving our apps and
          Tutorial etc. even further.
If we do get knowledge of any of your personal information (such as
          your email address, if you write to us), we will keep all of your
          personal information and communication
confidential
within our company.
