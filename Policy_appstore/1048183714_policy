Data Protection - Data Subject Request
Route de Genève 46
Case postale,
CH-1260 Nyon 2
Switzerland
We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:
• baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or
• further copies of the same information.
UEFA may refuse, restrict or defer the provision of information where UEFA has the right to do so under current data protection legislation.
Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will come back to you and let you know.
9 DATA SECURITY
We want you to feel confident about using the UEFA Platforms. Therefore, UEFA defines and implements the reasonable technical and organizational measures necessary to maintain the security of personal data, according to the nature of the personal data processed and the circumstances of the processing, with the objective of avoiding (in the realm of the possible and having regard to the state of the art) non-authorised processing or access, alteration or loss (to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability respectively).
UEFA uses industry standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions. If you communicate with UEFA otherwise than via UEFA Platforms (e.g. by e-mail), you should however note that the secrecy of Internet is uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential e-mail messages or information which are not encrypted, you accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the Internet.
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to UEFA. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a great concern. UEFA do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.
10 PROFILING
We may use the personal data you provide to us via UEFA Platforms, alone or in combination with personal data you have provided to our advertising partners to better understand your interests so we can try to predict what other products, services and information you might be most interested in. We call this profiling. Profiling enables us to tailor our communications (both directly from us and via our advertisers) and those of our third parties to make them more relevant and interesting for you.
If you do not want us to do this you may opt-out here
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
, or
http://www.aboutads.info/
or, for EU users only here:
http://youronlinechoices.eu/
.
Additionally, you may also opt-out of interest-based advertising by accessing the settings pages of our external advertisers:
•
Facebook
•
Instagram
•
X
•
Google
We do not use your personal data to make automated decisions about you that may have legal or similarly significant effects on you. Further information about your rights is set out at Section 8.
11 CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
The protection of personal data of children and adolescents is of particular concern to UEFA. The UEFA Platforms and their content are not directed at children under the age of thirteen (13). UEFA recommends that parents discuss the use of the Internet and the provision of personal data on websites with their children before allowing minors between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) to register.
UEFA will not knowingly collect personal data from or about children under thirteen (13) or knowingly allow minors between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) to register as users without parental permission. If a parent or legal guardian becomes aware that his or her child under sixteen (16) has registered as a user without their consent, he or she should delete the relevant account or if this is not possible, inform UEFA immediately. If UEFA becomes aware that a child under thirteen (13) or between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) but without parental permission has registered as a UEFA user, their access as a user will immediately be denied and their account deleted as quickly as possible (including all personal data associated with that account).
If you believe that UEFA might have any personal data from or about a child under thirteen (13), please notify UEFA in writing by email or mail to Union des Associations Européennes de Football – Corporate Legal Services - Data Protection, Route de Genève 46, Case postale, CH-1260 Nyon 2, Switzerland.
12 LINKS TO OTHER SITES
If any part of the UEFA Platforms link to other websites owned and operated by third parties, and you choose to visit or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. We do not exercise control over third party websites and therefore recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on these other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing personal data.
We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
13 CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
The Privacy Policy is available at any time on all UEFA Platforms and may be amended from time to time.
When we amend our Privacy Policy, we will however notify you where we have made significant changes and where we have a relationship with you. We will obtain your consent to any material Policy changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.
You can see when this Privacy Policy was last updated by checking the “Date of issue of the latest version of this Privacy Policy” displayed at the top of this Policy.
