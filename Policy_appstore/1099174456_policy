How do we collect your data?
Below you will find ways in which we collect your personal data:
When you provide information by e-mail, via the website or trading platform, phone, in writing, or other means. This includes, for example, the information you provide during the registration, signing up for further information, entering a promotion or survey.;
When you visit our websites, we will automatically collect information including the IP address. We also collect information about your visit, this includes the full click path and mouse movement, pages you visited, searches which were made and other page interaction information.;
It is possible that we will receive information about you from credit rating agencies, this collection is carried out in line with the Client Agreement.;
For Corporate clients we will also collect information which is publicly available in relation to the UBOs of the company.;
If you visit us in person, for security we collect images of visitors using CCTV.;
Why do we process your personal data?
DEGIRO collect personal data for the following reasons:
To comply with the legal and regulatory obligations;
Marketing activities; and
Execution of contractual obligations, for example sharing data with Custodians.
DEGIRO as branch of a German Bank has a number of regulatory obligations which require the processing of client data; customer identification is one of the main reasons we collect and process personal data. DEGIRO is therefore required to collect personal data in line with the Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme (Wwft). In addition to the financial regulations, DEGIRO must comply with Dutch Tax regulations and therefore are required to collect Tax Identification Numbers and other personal data (e.g. name, address details, tax residency etc.).These collected data are reported to the Dutch tax authorities, who may transfer the personal data to the local tax authorities in the country where the client is a tax resident. The legal basis for this exchange of personal information is the Dutch Law on International Assistance in Taxation (Wet op de internationale bijstandsverlening bij de heffing van belastingen (WIBB)) in which the CRS Directive  is codified.
As a US Qualified Intermediary (QI), DEGIRO has an agreement in place with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which allows for US withholding tax to be withheld at a reduced tax rate in accordance with a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation between the country of tax residence and the US (if applicable). DEGIRO may exchange personal data with the IRS insofar required under the QI Agreement.
Furthermore, DEGIRO reports personal data of clients with a Swedish tax residence to the Swedish tax authorities.
Further to this there are additional legal and regulatory obligations we must comply with,  co-operation with courts and authorised law enforcement agencies and to prevent and detect crime. Next to this, when people contact DEGIRO to ask for additional information or to become a client of DEGIRO, DEGIRO needs to be able to contact that client or potential client or you request us to send you our periodical newsletters. DEGIRO also has contractual obligations which mean that they need to process the data of their clients to fulfil these obligations.
When DEGIRO process the personal data of its clients, it does so by using the minimal amount of data possible to ensure that aim is met (following the principle of data minimisation).
What do we use personal data for?
DEGIRO may for example do the following with your personal data:
Client acceptance
It is required by law for us to verify the identity of our clients, and without this information DEGIRO could not provide its services to you. For DEGIRO to identify and verify clients, there have been internal policies and procedures written based upon both regulations and guidelines from relevant bodies. DEGIRO reviews these policies and procedures periodically to ensure they are appropriate.
DEGIRO makes use of Fourthline, to support the Know Your Customer (KYC) process.
Contact you.
Perform the relevant checks to ensure that you are eligible to become a client of DEGIRO.
Review and check your request to become our client or to change your profile.
Keep your details in our administration and update them when there are changes.
Manage your profile(s) including you individual risk profile; which are based on internal client acceptance policies.
Reduce risks
We share the responsibility for the safety and stability of the financial sector. We also have a responsibility to you and all our clients. We will therefore use your personal data to reduce risks.
You might notice for example:
If the risk on your account breaches the allowed limits, we will contact you to allow you to bring this back into the allowed limits.
You might not notice much of the below but it is also done to protect you:
We keep your IP address when you visit our site. This can be used in the event that there is a dispute as to who accessed your account or for the security of the company for example preventative measures against DDoS attacks.
Ensure good levels of security and invest in resources that protect both you and ourselves against all kind of crimes.

Ensure that we remain a healthy company (risk management).

Provide your personal data to specific organisations which are authorised to request this information, for example the tax authorities, financial supervisors, or when we are legally obliged to share this information for example during a criminal investigation.
We also have a number of obligations under anti money laundering legislation.
Under the ‘Shareholder Rights’ directive, DEGIRO is obliged to share information surrounding the owner of shares to the issuer when requested.

You can, of course, revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address, and their use for sending the newsletter at any time via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.
