Last updated January 23, 2024
This Privacy Policy covers your use of one or more of the BILT applications (individually or collectively referred to herein as the
“App”
), related software platform (the
“Software”
), or the website
https://biltapp.com/
(the
“Website”
) (collectively the
“Service”
). BILT Incorporated (
“BILT”
or
“we”
) understands that your privacy and privacy choices are important. Please read this Privacy Policy (the
“Policy”
) and Terms of Use in their entirety before using the Service.
Our Practices
This Privacy Policy sets forth BILT’s practices with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (
“Personal Data”
) that is collected and processed during your use of the Service.
Consent
By providing BILT your Personal Data, you expressly acknowledge and accept this Policy, and such consent grants us the faculty to treat your Personal Data as set forth herein and in accordance with the laws, regulations and other applicable legislation within the Territories applicable to your use.
Consent to Our Terms and Conditions
Please also visit our
Terms of Use
establishing your consent to the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of the App, the Service, and the Website. Your use of the App, Service, or Website is confirmation of your acceptance to the Terms of Use and the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Please know that for many of the instructions or features available on the App or Website, you do not need to create an account or provide BILT with your name, email address, or device ID.
However, some instructions (i.e. private instructions) and features are only available to users who register or create a BILT account for the Service. Further, when you voluntarily register a product through the App or provide reviews, BILT collects Person Data.  Specifically, BILT collects the following types of Personal Data:
When you register for the Service:
your name;
your email address;
if you register through a third-party account (i.e., a Facebook or Google account), the additional data which you permit the third party to send to BILT; and
other data which you may add to your BILT account
When you complete a voluntary product registration or other activity within the Service:
your name;
your email address;
information about the product you are registering (such as serial number, model number and date of purchase); and
information about product warranties or purchase receipts, including copies or images of warranties or receipts.
When you leave a product review of review of the BILT App:
We collect your name, email address, the date and time of your review, and any information you provide in the review.
Other data that you specifically provide to us, such as images or copies of receipts or warranties, and if you contact Customer Support.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, your Personal Data and all data related to the Service will be stored at BILT’s data centers within the United States. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to the United States and to the storage of your Personal Data within the United States. BILT uses Amazon Web Services to deliver the Service and for the storage of Personal Data.
Aggregate Data
We also collect various information about how our Service is used (such as which models were downloaded or how many times an assembly step was replayed), and store that information in connection with a pseudonymous identifier. We may aggregate this data with similar data from other users in order to help us identify trends and improve the Service. We may also share such aggregate data, without connection to your Personal Data, with our partners, customers, affiliates or licensees privately or publicly. BILT will retain Personal Data for as long as needed to provide the Services to you and BILT’s customers. BILT will also retain Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
How We Use the Information
We use the Personal Data and Aggregate Data collected:
To provide services you request, such as sending product registration information to product providers, keeping a record of your product registrations, or tracking warranty information;
To provide you updates on BILT, updates, upgrades, patches, or enhancements to the Service, and to receive and provide feedback;
To analyze usage and trends, and generally to improve our Services; and
To provide additional information on third party services and product offerings;
To provide your information to manufacturers, when you leave a review, who may wish to contact you to provide responses to your feedback or for marketing manufacturers’ purposes;
To keep you up to date on the latest product announcements on product instruction files you have downloaded, product updates, special offers, and other information; and
To conduct questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better products and services to our customers and end users.
Your completion of any questionnaire or survey is completely voluntary and we will offer an “Opt-out” choice to users for any surveys or questionnaires. As set forth in BILT’s Terms of Use, you agree to receive messages and notifications related to the above uses for which messages and notifications are relevant.  If you leave a product review or App review, you agree BILT can share your Personal Data with the product manufacturer, the manufacturer can contact you regarding your review, and that both the product manufacturer and BILT can publish and use your review.  Further, if you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email or other messaging means, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or attempt to resolve your problem.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE EU and Switzerland
BILT adheres to the privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy with respect to the Personal Data we collect from EU and Swiss data subjects, which includes data used to establish user accounts, process assembly or instruction file delivery, process product registrations and otherwise provide the Services.
Legal basis for processing personal information
For the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using Personal Data will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific purpose for which we collected or requested it. However, we will collect personal information from you only where:
we have your consent to do so;
we need the personal information to provide a service or to perform a contract or agreement with you; or
where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect or use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.
International Transfers
Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our App and Website servers are located in the United States and our third-party service providers and affiliates operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the European Economic Area, where we transfer your personal information to other countries, we rely on:
European Commission adequacy decisions, which acknowledge that the non-EEA countries listed here have national laws that protect personal information to a substantially similar standard required by European Union law;
the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, which require non-EEA recipients of personal information to continue to protect the personal information they receive to the standard required by European Union law; or
other lawful data transfer mechanisms or derogations from data transfer restrictions.
Further details can be provided upon request. Please see contact information below.
Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States, should direct their query to
privacy@biltcorp.com
. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
We will provide an individual an opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to
privacy@biltcorp.com
.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
BILT remains responsible and liable for third-party agents BILT engages to process Personal Data on its behalf if it does so in a manner inconsistent with the principles set forth herein, unless BILT proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
BILT commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States. European Union and Swiss individuals with Personal Data inquiries or complaints should contact BILT by email at
privacy@biltcorp.com
or via post at:

How We Share Information
Other than the sharing of Personal Data as set forth in the Privacy Policy herein (i.e., product registration or product reviews), BILT will not sell or rent your Personal Data to any third party without your consent.
Product Registration.
Use of the Service allows the App to collect product registration information from you to share with product providers. If you fill out a product registration form via the Service, the Service will share or send the Personal Data information you provide to the provider of the product that you are attempting to register. Once this information is shared or sent to the product provider, such Personal Data information will be handled in accordance with the product provider’s privacy policy practices. In territories where applicable, BILT has entered into data processing agreements with the product providers to ensure they protect your information in accordance with appropriate security standards. Ultimately, you determine the information you chose to share with the product providers. We recommend you familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of the product providers in advance of submitting or sharing any Personal Data during a product registration. Filling out product registrations is entirely voluntary.
We may transfer your Personal Data to third parties in the following situations:
When you have given us consent to do so;
To our subsidiaries, affiliated legal entities and service providers around the world based on necessary data processing agreements, who may only use the data to provide the Service or related information and updates to you;
When you leave a product review we can share the review and related Personal Data associated with the Review to the product provider;
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your data and other related information, if necessary or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
In order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Information for EU and UK Data Subjects Related to Data Collected through our Service
BILT is considered a controller or processor. BILT uses sub-processors. BILT has entered into appropriate Data Processing Addendums or Agreements with our sub-processors controlling protection of your Personal Data. We may transfer Personal Data to third party processor companies (i.e. cloud data and server services) that help us provide the Service. Such third-party processors are located in, and the transfers are limited to, the United States or countries in the European Union and these processors are controlled by data processing agreements providing the same protections of your personal data. BILT uses Amazon Web Services to deliver the Service and for the storage of Personal Data.
For such onward transfers to third parties, BILT shall remain liable in the event our sub-processors process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, unless BILT proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to any liability or damage.
Security Measures
We use a variety of security measures, including firewalls, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, encryption, and authentication tools to help protect Personal Data. We protect your Personal Data with the same or better security measures as we protect our company data.
