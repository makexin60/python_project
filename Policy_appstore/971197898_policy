Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, SDKs, local storage, and other technologies (“
Technologies

Cookies.
Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about users’ engagement.

In addition, if you watch Tastemade content on a Streaming Platform, certain device level information may be shared by the Streaming Platform with Tastemade and/or Tastemade’s advertising partners.
Tastemade and its advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when you view Tastemade content, view other third-party content, or visit other third party services that Tastemade’s advertising partners work with.

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN PERSONAL INFORMATION.
In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to: (i) request confirmation of whether we are processing your personal information; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your personal information; (iii) receive an electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another company (the “right of data portability”); (iv) restrict our uses of your personal information; (v) seek correction or amendment of inaccurate, untrue, incomplete, or improperly processed personal information; and (vi) request erasure of personal information held about you by Tastemade, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth below.
We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, Tastemade will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
If you are a California resident, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Tastemade for the exercise of your rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act (
“CCPA”
). A Note Regarding the CCPA. The CCPA provides California residents with the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. Under the CCPA, a “sale” means providing to a third party personal information for valuable consideration. It does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information.
Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we will continue to evaluate some of our third-party relationships as we wait for final implementing regulations and guidance. For example, through your use of the Services, advertising partners may collect cookies and related information which allows us to provide you with interest-based advertising. It is currently unclear whether the use of these advertising partners would be considered a “sale” under CCPA. If you prefer not to receive interest-based advertising, please opt out by following the instructions found in “Technologies and Personalized Advertising” found above.
We will continue to update our business practices as regulatory guidance becomes available and provides clarity on what constitutes a “sale,” particularly in the advertising ecosystem.
DATA RETENTION.
We retain the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.
We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
By using the Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by sending a notice through the Services or by sending an e-mail to you.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES/APPLICATIONS.
The Services may contain links to other websites/applications and other websites/applications may reference or link to our Services. These third party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.

If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth below. If we learn that we have collected any personal information in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, Tastemade does not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.

For the purposes of European Economic Area data protection law, (the "Data Protection Law"), we are the data controller.
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We appreciate that you do not want your personal information distributed indiscriminately and we provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, such as applications and websites using Facebook and other social media sites, even if they are accessible through our Services.
Please read this Privacy Policy, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at info@tastemade.com. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use found at https://www.tastemade.com/terms.
Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
By using our Services, you acknowledge you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
How do we collect your information?

We may collect and process the following information about you:

This is information about you that you give us directly when you interact with us.

We will automatically collect information from you each time you use our Services. This includes:

Information we receive from other sources

If you use any of the other websites or apps we operate or the other services we provide;
From third parties we work closely with; and
From social networking services, if you choose to create or sign-in to an account through one of your social networking service accounts.
You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.
Cookies and other technologies
Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we call this information “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links or buttons on our Services that a User clicked on (including advertisements clicked on) and other statistics.
Our Services use cookies, pixels and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our Services. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site, use our App, or otherwise engage with our Services and also allows us to improve our Services.
When you use the Services, a web server sends a cookie or other similar technology such as device IDs or pixel tags to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be). These typically involves small pieces of information or code which are issued to or accessed from your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or app and which store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies and similar technologies enable you to be remembered when using that computer or device to interact with websites, apps and online services and can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalized content.
We use these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you (i.e. the provision of Services), or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you have consented to their use.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and similar technologies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that and your help screen or manual will tell you how to do this. We also give you information about how to disable cookies here. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Services if you do so. A number of cookies and similar technologies we use last only for the duration of your use of our Services and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies and similar technologies are used to remember you when you return to use the Services and will last for longer.
Disabling cookies
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser or mobile device.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.
Cookie Table
We and our partners may use cookies, pixels and/or other similar technologies, either alone or in combination with each other as set out in the following table:

Security of your information
We place great importance on the security of all personal information associated with our users.

Where you have chosen (or we have given you) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

Privacy
Effective July 12, 2017
Protecting your privacy is really important to us.
This Privacy Policy covers all of the services of Tastemade, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Tastemade”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), and our mobile applications, desktop application services, software and other materials and services made available on, from or through the foregoing (collectively, the “Services”). We’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, such as applications and websites using Facebook, even if they are accessible through our Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Services. Please read this Privacy Policy, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at
info@tastemade.com
. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use found at
https://www.tastemade.com/terms
.
If you don’t consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Services.
HOW DO WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION?
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your account, if you are an account holder) and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
Account Information.
When you create an account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, which may include your name, email address, mailing address and photo (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). We may also collect certain information that isn’t considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your individual preferences. If you choose to create or sign-in to an account through one of your social networking service accounts (“SNS Accounts”), you may have to provide us with your username (or user ID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to link your account with the SNS Account and access certain PII, such as your name, email address, photo and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts. We may use your PII to contact you with emails, newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the opt-out procedure described in this Privacy Policy below.
Information Collected Using Cookies.
We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. We engage third-party services providers (including third-party advertisers) that may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.
Information Related to Use and Subscription of the Services.
Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we call this information “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links or buttons on our Services that a User clicked on (including advertisements clicked on) and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying, non-personal information about how our Services are used. By using the Services, you understand and agree that Tastemade is providing a platform for you to view and upload content, including comments and other materials to the Services and to share content publicly. This means that other users may search for, see, use or share any of the content that you create and make publicly available through the Services, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Tastemade’s Terms of Use. If you subscribe to a paid Service, we use Stripe to process and accept payments, or if you subscribe to a paid Service via Apple iTunes or Google Play, your payment will be processed via those respective services. We do not store any credit card information, but Stripe (or Apple or Google, as applicable) will collect credit card information and any other payment-related information. Each such third-party service uses the payment-related information that it receives as necessary and appropriate to fulfil requests to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing and to otherwise deliver payment services. Personally identifiable information about Users is used by each such service to process payment transactions and for no other purpose, and this information is subject to Stripe’s privacy policy and terms of use found at
https://stripe.com/us/terms
; Apple’s iTunes privacy policy and terms of use found at
http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/
and http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html; and Google Play’s privacy policy and terms of use found at
https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
and
https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html
.
Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.
We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
Location Information.
In some cases, we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?
We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:
Information Shared with Our Services Providers.
We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf or to enable us to provide better Services for you.
Information Shared with Third Parties.
We may share aggregated information and non-identifying, non-personal information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, measurement of advertising effectiveness and other similar purposes. In addition, advertisers, advertising technology companies and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness and enable other enhancements. This information may include your use of the Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed and your other activities online. We may also provide your PII to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such tailored advertisements or communications by following the opt-out procedure described in this Privacy Policy below.
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.
Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.
It’s our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it’s also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE WITH YOUR CONSENT OR AT YOUR REQUEST.
We’ll share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.
THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive and/or personally-identifying information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. So, we can’t guarantee the absolute security of any information you provide to us, but we’ll take every reasonable measure to do so.
LINKS TO OTHER SITES
Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to those websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information, we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access too.
EMAILING AND MESSAGING VIA A TASTEMADE ACCOUNT
As part of some of our Services, account holders may be able to •communicate with other account holders, through use of direct messaging and email functionality associated with their accounts. Your email address will not be visible to other account holders in such communications.

RESPONDING TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Our Services do not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers. Other parties may collect PII about Users’ online activities over time and across different websites when Users use other operators’ websites or online services.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.
OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.

Information Related to Use and Subscription of the Services.
Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we call this information “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links or buttons on our Services that a User clicked on (including advertisements clicked on) and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying, non-personal information about how our Services are used. By using the Services, you understand and agree that Tastemade is providing a platform for you to view and upload content, including comments and other materials to the Services and to share content publicly.

If you subscribe to a paid Service, we use Stripe to process and accept payments, or if you subscribe to a paid Service via Apple iTunes or Google Play, your payment will be processed via those respective services. We do not store any credit card information, but Stripe (or Apple or Google, as applicable) will collect credit card information and any other payment-related information. Each such third-party service uses the payment-related information that it receives as necessary and appropriate to fulfil requests to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing and to otherwise deliver payment services. Personally identifiable information about Users is used by each such service to process payment transactions and for no other purpose, and this information is subject to Stripe’s privacy policy and terms of use found at

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?
We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:
Information Shared with Our Services Providers.
We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf or to enable us to provide better Services for you.
Information Shared with Third Parties.
We may share aggregated information and non-identifying, non-personal information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, measurement of advertising effectiveness and other similar purposes. In addition, advertisers, advertising technology companies and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness and enable other enhancements. This information may include your use of the Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed and your other activities online. We may also provide your PII to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such tailored advertisements or communications by following the opt-out procedure described in this Privacy Policy below.
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.
Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.
It’s our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it’s also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE WITH YOUR CONSENT OR AT YOUR REQUEST.
We’ll share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.
THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive and/or personally-identifying information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. So, we can’t guarantee the absolute security of any information you provide to us, but we’ll take every reasonable measure to do so.
LINKS TO OTHER SITES
Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to those websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information, we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access too.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.
