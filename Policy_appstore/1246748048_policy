Keeping your data safe
We protect your privacy by ensuring we have the appropriate security measures in place, backed up by contractual obligations, to ensure that our suppliers process your data in an appropriate, lawful and safe manner.

to notify you when your Railcard is due to expire, and to suggest other relevant products if you no longer qualify for your current Railcard

to send you information about any changes to your Railcard’s terms and conditions; and
to alert you to any changes to this Privacy Notice
We analyze our customer data for sales insight and marketing research including demographic, geographic and attitude analysis to understand who our customers are in groups rather than as individuals.
We have a legitimate interest in improving our products and services, and we conduct market research for this purpose. We may therefore contact you from time to time to invite you to participate in our market research. This research may be carried out by a supplier not currently listed in this Privacy Notice, however we will always inform you who is completing this research on our behalf. Your data will be shared with this supplier for this purpose alone and will be deleted once this research has been completed.
If you enter one of our prize draws for market research or competitions, the data we collect will be kept securely whilst the survey and/or competition is live. The prize draw winner's(s') details (first name and county) will be made available for 30 days after the closing date to those who email marketing@raildeliverygroup.com with the survey title as the subject line. Personal details will only be used for the purpose of the prize draw and will be deleted once the winner has been confirmed.
How long do we keep your data?
We keep your data while your Railcard is valid and for two years thereafter to enable you to renew easily within that period. During this time, you may receive other communications from us if you have consented.
If you have started but not completed a Railcard application and haven’t purchased a Railcard using an online account with us before, the data you have entered will be held for 30 days to allow you to return to complete your application. After that time, it will be deleted.
If you participate in a prize draw for market research or competitions, your entry will be held for 30 days and then deleted.

to remind you when your Veterans Railcard is due to expire.
to send you information about any changes to your Veterans Railcard’s terms and conditions; and
to alert you to any changes to this Privacy Notice
We do some analysis on our customer data for sales analysis and marketing research including demographic, geographic and attitude analysis to understand who our customers are in groups rather than as individuals.
We have a legitimate interest in improving our products and services, and we conduct market research for this purpose. We may therefore contact you from time to time to invite you to participate in our market research. This research may be carried out by a supplier not currently listed in this Privacy Notice, however we will always inform you who is completing this research on our behalf. Your data will be shared with this supplier for this purpose alone and will be deleted once this research has been completed.
If you enter one of our prize draws for market research or competitions, the data we collect will be kept securely whilst the survey and/or competition is live. The prize draw winner(s) details (first name and county) will be made available after the closing date for 30 days to those who send an email to
marketing@raildeliverygroup.com
with the survey title as the subject line. Personal details will only be used for the purpose of the prize draw and will be deleted once the winner has been confirmed.
How long do we keep your data?
If you have registered your interest for updates about the Veterans Railcard, we will keep your data until the promotional sale period of the Railcard has ended. Your data will then be deleted from all systems unless you have purchased a Veterans Railcard.
We keep your data while your Veterans Railcard is valid, and for two years thereafter to enable you to renew easily within that period. During this time you may receive other communications from us if you have consented.
If you participate in a prize draw for market research or competitions, your entry will be held for 30 days and then deleted.
If you are domiciled in Scotland and purchase a Veterans Railcard before 31 March 2021, your name, address and postcode will be stored by Abellio Transport Ltd until 30 June 2021.
