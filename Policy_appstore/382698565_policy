Protecting your privacy
This Privacy Policy explains how American Airlines, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "American") collects, uses, shares, and protects information both in connection with American’s online and offline services, systems, websites, and apps that refer or link to this Privacy Policy (our "Services"), and as explained below, including without limitation, the collection and processing of personal information in connection with bookings and travel on American Airlines or flights operated by our regional carriers (for example, Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines and PSA Airlines), as well as loyalty data collected and processed in connection with the AAdvantage
®
program. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the way you interact with our Services or the type of device or other means you use to access our Services.
Generally, the “Services” covered by this Privacy Policy fall into one of three categories:
Services related to your reservations and travel, for bookings that include travel on American or that are made through an American owned and operated service (“Travel Services”)
Services related to memberships or programs that you enroll in or purchase benefits from, such as the AAdvantage
®
or AAdvantage Business™ loyalty programs, Admirals Club
®
memberships, or use of Buy, Gift, Transfer to purchase AAdvantage
®
miles (“Program Services”)
Services operated by American to enable you to interact with American, including the websites, mobile apps, and telephone and text messaging systems that enable you to access American’s Travel Services or Program Services (“Interactive Services”)
Some services or programs offered by American (such as SimplyMiles
®
or AAdvantage eShopping
®
) may have additional privacy disclosures to help you understand the collection and use of your personal information under the terms of use of those programs. You will be provided notice of these additional privacy disclosures on the website or mobile app where you register for or use these services. Such disclosures should be read in addition to this Privacy Policy.
American reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the updated Policy here along with the date on which the Policy was changed. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that affect the way we collect, use and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by including a "NEWLY UPDATED" label with the "PRIVACY POLICY" link on aa.com for 30 days after material changes are made. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any contractual rights or obligations.

This content can be expanded
When we use the term ‘personal information,’ we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be associated with you, including the categories and specific types of information described in this Privacy Policy.
We collect and maintain personal information about you from many sources to understand and meet your needs, facilitate your travel, manage our business, and for other purposes disclosed to you. For example, we collect or receive personal information about you from:

If the information is to be collected directly from you, you may in some cases have the option to decline providing American that information.

American will also collect information about changes to your booking, including a cancellation or failure to complete your travel, upgrades, your baggage requirements, airport disruption, and lost baggage
If you book travel for someone else, American may collect your billing information but may communicate with the passenger directly about their flight

Technical information, including browser type, IP address, type of operating system, geolocation, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited on our websites or other digital properties (as further described in the section titled “Automatically collected information (including cookies and geolocation)”)
The content of correspondence you send to us, including information provided via survey, focus group or other marketing research efforts, the content of emails or online customer service requests you send to us, the content of chat, text message, social media, or other communications with us, recordings of calls to our automated or live representative phone services, and our responses to you
Sensitive personal information
This content can be expanded
To the extent that the personal information we collect constitutes sensitive personal information under applicable law, American will collect and process this sensitive personal information within the limits provided by applicable law. Where required by law, and where no other lawful bases exist for processing such data (such as to fulfill laws promoting a substantial public interest), American will seek your specific consent before processing sensitive personal information.
You may submit a request for services (such as a meal preference, or a request for wheelchair assistance) which is not sensitive personal information. American does not consider such data to reliably imply or suggest sensitive personal information.
In some instances, mobile devices or online services may offer you the choice of biometric identification such as fingerprint or facial recognition for enhanced security and convenience. Where possible, these security measures rely on your personal device’s own internal biometric management and secure storage, in which case American does not have access to any biometric information. You may contact your device’s biometric management creator (such as Apple or Google) for more information about their biometric security technology.
You may be offered opportunities to participate in programs that collect biometric information, which are offered to you in connection with your travel, but are not operated by American Airlines. For example, you may be offered the opportunity to participate in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Biometric Exit program. When you choose to participate in these programs, your biometric information is not collected or stored by American, and we do not have access to or control of your biometric information. For information about these programs, please contact the agency or entity that operates the program.

Data collected from other customers
When you provide information to us about your travel companions or other individuals (for example, when you make a booking that includes additional travelers), you confirm to us that you are acting on behalf of such individuals, and you have their permission to provide us their information for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not have their permission, you must not provide us with any personal information about these individuals.
If your travel companions or other individuals have questions about how their personal information will be processed by American, please refer them to this Privacy Policy.
Minors
This content can be expanded
American does not knowingly collect personal information directly from children – persons under the age of 13, or another age if required by applicable law – other than when required to comply with the law or for safety and security reasons. Due to the nature of our Services, we may collect travel information, which may include personal information, about children when it is required to comply with the law, including federal aviation or security regulations, as otherwise required to provide transportation needs and services, or for safety or security reasons. We may retain personal information when required to provide transportation and related services to a child, or in connection with services purchased or enrolled by the parent or guardian on the child’s behalf (such as a parent or guardian’s enrollment of their child in the AAdvantage
®
program).
If you are not the parent or guardian of the child, or otherwise authorized by the child’s parent or guardian, you must not provide us with any personal information of the child.
If you are a parent or guardian of a child who has provided personal information without your knowledge and consent, you may request we remove this child’s information by emailing us at privacy@aa.com.

Automatically collected information (including cookies and geolocation)
This content can be expanded
When you use our Interactive Services, we may receive technical information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, your geolocation, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited. American gets this information by using technologies, including cookies, web beacons, and mobile device geolocation to provide and improve our Interactive Services and advertising, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests and for reporting activity on our Interactive Services. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our Interactive Services or which pages or features get the most attention. This technical information may be combined with information that is personally identifiable in order to personalize our Interactive Services and advertising to your interests, including across browsers and devices. For example, if you spend time reviewing a particular flight or destination but do not complete a travel reservation, we may use this information to show you targeted advertising about similar flights or destinations on our Interactive Services or on third-party websites. Some of this information may be shared with third parties, as described in the section titled “Information collected by third parties on our Services.”
Additionally, and with your specific consent where required by law, American may combine the information we receive from you with information collected from other sources. This information may be used to provide offers and / or services specifically tailored to your interests in accordance with applicable laws.
Cookies and online advertising
This content can be expanded
When you use our Interactive Services, we and third parties on our Interactive Services may automatically receive information using tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively, “Cookies”). This information includes your browser type, IP address, type of operating system you use, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited on our Interactive Services.
We use Cookies for a variety of reasons, including to provide and improve our Interactive Services and advertising and to show you advertising that is relevant to you, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). Some Cookies are necessary to keep our Interactive Services secure. Others ensure you get a high-quality experience and receive relevant advertising.
Some of our Interactive Services include social network or other third-party plug-ins (such as Facebook’s "Like" button) that enable you to log in to certain Interactive Services, to comment on content available on our Interactive Services, and to share things you find on our Interactive Services with your social network. The providers of these plug-ins may be able to collect information about you even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget and regardless of whether you have an account or other relationship with these social networks and third parties. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures to learn what information they collect, use, and share.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to a user’s browser from a website’s computers and stored on a user’s computer’s hard drive, tablet, or mobile device. The cookie stores a small amount of data on your device about your visit to the Interactive Services. Some Cookies are “session cookies,” which expire at the end of the browser session and can capture your activities during the browser session. Other Cookies are “persistent cookies” which remain on your device for the period specified in the Cookie and are able to capture your settings or activities on multiple websites.
Cookies allow websites to recognize your browser or device during your use of our Interactive Services and some Cookies also allow us to track your behavior when you use the services (e.g., websites or apps) of other entities.

What Cookies do we use?
1. Strictly Necessary Cookies:
These Cookies enable you to use our Interactive Services. These Cookies are essential to enable you to browse our Interactive Services and use certain features you have specifically requested. These types of Cookies allow us to:
record that you are logged into your account;
record when you give consent to or opt out of our use of advertising or non-essential Cookies, when applicable;
enable you to use features that provide products and service to you and manage transactions, including enabling the Interactive Services you use to remember the items that you add to your shopping cart or the information you provided in forms;
display the product reviews that you submit to us; and
provide the necessary security the Interactive Services require, for example, to monitor traffic flow and visits in order to let us know of potential security threats (e.g., in case of unusually high or rapid traffic).
We want you to understand these essential Cookies, and why we use them, but your consent is not required for us to use them as we use these Cookies only as necessary to operate the Interactive Services. If you set your browser or device to reject essential Cookies, this may prevent you from using certain parts of the Interactive Services. For example, without these Cookies, services such as shopping activity and paying activity on our websites cannot be provided.
2. Functional Cookies:
These Cookies store information such as your preferred country and language selection, AAdvantage
®
login data, and website preferences. Without these Cookies, our Interactive Services may not be able to remember certain choices you've previously made (such as a saved country / language preference) or enhance your browsing experience by providing you with relevant information (such as saved reservation preferences or AAdvantage
®
award miles balance). These Cookies can recognize what browser or device you are using and what website you come from, and offer you a more personal experience so that you do not have to provide the same information more than once. We also use these Cookies to enable you to comment on a discussion in a forum, or to provide enhanced services such as enabling you to view a video on our website. Disabling these Cookies means that you will be asked to reenter this information every time you use our Interactive Services.
3. Performance Cookies:
These Cookies collect information about how you use our Interactive Services such as which pages you visit regularly. They allow us to understand:
which of our Interactive Services and their functions our customers use most often so that we can use this information to improve their functionality;
your preferences to ensure that more relevant content (including advertising content) is delivered to you;
website performance such as page load and site response times, in order to monitor, identify, and fix performance issues; and
if you get error messages.
4. Content / advertising Cookies:
These cookies gather information about your use of our Interactive Services so we may improve your experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising. They are also used to gather feedback on customer satisfaction through surveys. They remember that you've visited our Interactive Services and help us understand usage of our Interactive Services and tailor advertisements to you. These Cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Some of these Cookies are from third parties that collect information about users of our Interactive Services (as described in the section titled “Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising”) in order to provide advertising (on our Interactive Services and elsewhere) based on users’ online activities (so-called "interest-based advertising") on our Services and elsewhere online.
Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising
Online behavioral advertising, also known as interest-based advertising, is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests. The third parties involved in interest-based advertising collect internet browsing information (e.g., websites visited, time of visit) across different websites and over time, and they may use the information they collect on our Interactive Services to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet. This may include information about you, such as travel destinations that you search for while using our Interactive Services. These third parties may use the information they collect on our Interactive Services to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet (for example, travel products and services that are available at a destination you searched for online). Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on online activities.
To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices, please opt out through the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative website and also through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. Your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising. If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests. American's websites do not honor web browsers' Do-Not-Track signals.

Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive advertisements. Instead, the advertising you do see will likely be less relevant to your interests. Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.
How to manage Cookies
If you do not wish to receive Cookies, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your device. You may also delete Cookies as soon as you leave our Interactive Services. Although you are not required to accept Cookies when you visit our Interactive Services, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of the Interactive Services.
For example, the Help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when new Cookies are dropped, and how to entirely disable Cookies.

This content can be expanded
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Interactive Services may be provided by third parties, including third parties that are not affiliated with us.

How your information will be used
This content can be expanded
Our Services
We use personal information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our products and services.

Data security and integrity
This content can be expanded
We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information you provide to us.
American uses reasonable technical, administrative, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current. When your personal information is shared, American will take a reasonable approach to prevent the unauthorized use of personal information.
Please note, however, that while American attempts to safeguard your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
Here are some things you can do to keep your information secure.
Keep your confirmation code confidential:
When you make a booking, you will be given a 6-character confirmation code, also known as a Passenger Name Record (PNR). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your record locator confidential, as giving it to others may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others and do not want them to have access to your booking details, you should have each person make their own bookings.
Keep your AAdvantage® account number and login information confidential:
To make sure your access to our Services is secure; you should not share your log in details with anyone else. You should always log out of the Services after each use if others have access to your computer or device, especially if you are using a publicly accessible computer such as at a library or internet café. You should follow best practices for online security, such as using a different password for our Services than you do with other websites or services. American is not responsible if someone gains access to your accounts by obtaining your password.
Data retention policy
This content can be expanded
Your personal information will be retained only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above and consistent with our retention policies, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, legal requirements and the duration of your use of our website and receipt of our Services. This retention will be at least for the duration of your customer relationship with us, and a longer period as necessary for legal defense purposes or as required by tax, aviation, and other applicable laws and regulations.
We generally retain personal information related to your use of our Travel Services or Program Services for up to seven years after you complete your travel or terminate your membership with us. This includes information obtained from your use of our Interactive Services (for example, when you book, manage, or cancel travel through our websites or mobile apps).
To the extent it is required to do so by law, American will permanently destroy any biometric data or identifiers in our possession once the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining them has been satisfied, or within three years of your last interaction with American, whichever comes first. This applies to any biometric identifiers or information received by American from any source, even if that source does not refer or link to this Privacy Policy.
With whom your information will be shared
This content can be expanded

Privacy policy
Updated November 27, 2024
Protecting your privacy
This Privacy Policy explains how American Airlines, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "American") collects, uses, shares, and protects information both in connection with American’s online and offline services, systems, websites, and apps that refer or link to this Privacy Policy (our "Services"), and as explained below, including without limitation, the collection and processing of personal information in connection with bookings and travel on American Airlines or flights operated by our regional carriers (for example, Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines and PSA Airlines), as well as loyalty data collected and processed in connection with the AAdvantage
®
program. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the way you interact with our Services or the type of device or other means you use to access our Services.
Generally, the “Services” covered by this Privacy Policy fall into one of three categories:
Services related to your reservations and travel, for bookings that include travel on American or that are made through an American owned and operated service (“Travel Services”)
Services related to memberships or programs that you enroll in or purchase benefits from, such as the AAdvantage
®
or AAdvantage Business™ loyalty programs, Admirals Club
®
memberships, or use of Buy, Gift, Transfer to purchase AAdvantage
®
miles (“Program Services”)
Services operated by American to enable you to interact with American, including the websites, mobile apps, and telephone and text messaging systems that enable you to access American’s Travel Services or Program Services (“Interactive Services”)
Some services or programs offered by American (such as SimplyMiles
®
or AAdvantage eShopping
®
) may have additional privacy disclosures to help you understand the collection and use of your personal information under the terms of use of those programs. You will be provided notice of these additional privacy disclosures on the website or mobile app where you register for or use these services. Such disclosures should be read in addition to this Privacy Policy.
American reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the updated Policy here along with the date on which the Policy was changed. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that affect the way we collect, use and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by including a "NEWLY UPDATED" label with the "PRIVACY POLICY" link on aa.com for 30 days after material changes are made. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any contractual rights or obligations.
Information we collect and how we collect it
This content can be expanded
When we use the term ‘personal information,’ we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be associated with you, including the categories and specific types of information described in this Privacy Policy.
We collect and maintain personal information about you from many sources to understand and meet your needs, facilitate your travel, manage our business, and for other purposes disclosed to you. For example, we collect or receive personal information about you from:

If the information is to be collected directly from you, you may in some cases have the option to decline providing American that information.

American will also collect information about changes to your booking, including a cancellation or failure to complete your travel, upgrades, your baggage requirements, airport disruption, and lost baggage
If you book travel for someone else, American may collect your billing information but may communicate with the passenger directly about their flight
Other information required to facilitate Travel Services, such as requests for assistance, dietary restrictions, interactions with staff and cabin crew, travel companion name(s), emergency contacts, photographs, information about your prior flights, and travel-related issues
Payment information, including credit or debit card number(s), associated billing address(es), and expiration date(s)

You have otherwise chosen to provide such information to us or it has been passed onto us by a third party, such as the travel agent through which you made your booking or other entity, including information about whether you have symptoms of a communicable disease or virus (such as COVID-19), an appropriate vaccination, or a negative test result
Health information related to a medical emergency that occurs while traveling
Biometric information, such as a scan of your face, fingerprint, or other biometric identifiers, as disclosed to you when you participate in a biometric authentication program

Technical information, including browser type, IP address, type of operating system, geolocation, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited on our websites or other digital properties (as further described in the section titled “Automatically collected information (including cookies and geolocation)”)
The content of correspondence you send to us, including information provided via survey, focus group or other marketing research efforts, the content of emails or online customer service requests you send to us, the content of chat, text message, social media, or other communications with us, recordings of calls to our automated or live representative phone services, and our responses to you
Sensitive personal information
This content can be expanded
To the extent that the personal information we collect constitutes sensitive personal information under applicable law, American will collect and process this sensitive personal information within the limits provided by applicable law. Where required by law, and where no other lawful bases exist for processing such data (such as to fulfill laws promoting a substantial public interest), American will seek your specific consent before processing sensitive personal information.
You may submit a request for services (such as a meal preference, or a request for wheelchair assistance) which is not sensitive personal information. American does not consider such data to reliably imply or suggest sensitive personal information.
In some instances, mobile devices or online services may offer you the choice of biometric identification such as fingerprint or facial recognition for enhanced security and convenience. Where possible, these security measures rely on your personal device’s own internal biometric management and secure storage, in which case American does not have access to any biometric information. You may contact your device’s biometric management creator (such as Apple or Google) for more information about their biometric security technology.
You may be offered opportunities to participate in programs that collect biometric information, which are offered to you in connection with your travel, but are not operated by American Airlines. For example, you may be offered the opportunity to participate in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Biometric Exit program. When you choose to participate in these programs, your biometric information is not collected or stored by American, and we do not have access to or control of your biometric information. For information about these programs, please contact the agency or entity that operates the program.

Data collected from other customers
When you provide information to us about your travel companions or other individuals (for example, when you make a booking that includes additional travelers), you confirm to us that you are acting on behalf of such individuals, and you have their permission to provide us their information for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not have their permission, you must not provide us with any personal information about these individuals.

Minors
This content can be expanded
American does not knowingly collect personal information directly from children – persons under the age of 13, or another age if required by applicable law – other than when required to comply with the law or for safety and security reasons. Due to the nature of our Services, we may collect travel information, which may include personal information, about children when it is required to comply with the law, including federal aviation or security regulations, as otherwise required to provide transportation needs and services, or for safety or security reasons. We may retain personal information when required to provide transportation and related services to a child, or in connection with services purchased or enrolled by the parent or guardian on the child’s behalf (such as a parent or guardian’s enrollment of their child in the AAdvantage
®
program).
If you are not the parent or guardian of the child, or otherwise authorized by the child’s parent or guardian, you must not provide us with any personal information of the child.
If you are a parent or guardian of a child who has provided personal information without your knowledge and consent, you may request we remove this child’s information by emailing us at privacy@aa.com.

Automatically collected information (including cookies and geolocation)
This content can be expanded
When you use our Interactive Services, we may receive technical information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, your geolocation, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited. American gets this information by using technologies, including cookies, web beacons, and mobile device geolocation to provide and improve our Interactive Services and advertising, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests and for reporting activity on our Interactive Services. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our Interactive Services or which pages or features get the most attention. This technical information may be combined with information that is personally identifiable in order to personalize our Interactive Services and advertising to your interests, including across browsers and devices. For example, if you spend time reviewing a particular flight or destination but do not complete a travel reservation, we may use this information to show you targeted advertising about similar flights or destinations on our Interactive Services or on third-party websites. Some of this information may be shared with third parties, as described in the section titled “Information collected by third parties on our Services.”
Additionally, and with your specific consent where required by law, American may combine the information we receive from you with information collected from other sources. This information may be used to provide offers and / or services specifically tailored to your interests in accordance with applicable laws.
Cookies and online advertising
This content can be expanded
When you use our Interactive Services, we and third parties on our Interactive Services may automatically receive information using tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively, “Cookies”). This information includes your browser type, IP address, type of operating system you use, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited on our Interactive Services.
We use Cookies for a variety of reasons, including to provide and improve our Interactive Services and advertising and to show you advertising that is relevant to you, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). Some Cookies are necessary to keep our Interactive Services secure. Others ensure you get a high-quality experience and receive relevant advertising.
Some of our Interactive Services include social network or other third-party plug-ins (such as Facebook’s "Like" button) that enable you to log in to certain Interactive Services, to comment on content available on our Interactive Services, and to share things you find on our Interactive Services with your social network. The providers of these plug-ins may be able to collect information about you even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget and regardless of whether you have an account or other relationship with these social networks and third parties. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures to learn what information they collect, use, and share.

The cookie stores a small amount of data on your device about your visit to the Interactive Services. Some Cookies are “session cookies,” which expire at the end of the browser session and can capture your activities during the browser session. Other Cookies are “persistent cookies” which remain on your device for the period specified in the Cookie and are able to capture your settings or activities on multiple websites.

What Cookies do we use?
1. Strictly Necessary Cookies:
These Cookies enable you to use our Interactive Services. These Cookies are essential to enable you to browse our Interactive Services and use certain features you have specifically requested. These types of Cookies allow us to:
record that you are logged into your account;
record when you give consent to or opt out of our use of advertising or non-essential Cookies, when applicable;
enable you to use features that provide products and service to you and manage transactions, including enabling the Interactive Services you use to remember the items that you add to your shopping cart or the information you provided in forms;
display the product reviews that you submit to us; and
provide the necessary security the Interactive Services require, for example, to monitor traffic flow and visits in order to let us know of potential security threats (e.g., in case of unusually high or rapid traffic).
We want you to understand these essential Cookies, and why we use them, but your consent is not required for us to use them as we use these Cookies only as necessary to operate the Interactive Services. If you set your browser or device to reject essential Cookies, this may prevent you from using certain parts of the Interactive Services. For example, without these Cookies, services such as shopping activity and paying activity on our websites cannot be provided.
2. Functional Cookies:
These Cookies store information such as your preferred country and language selection, AAdvantage
®
login data, and website preferences. Without these Cookies, our Interactive Services may not be able to remember certain choices you've previously made (such as a saved country / language preference) or enhance your browsing experience by providing you with relevant information (such as saved reservation preferences or AAdvantage
®
award miles balance). These Cookies can recognize what browser or device you are using and what website you come from, and offer you a more personal experience so that you do not have to provide the same information more than once. We also use these Cookies to enable you to comment on a discussion in a forum, or to provide enhanced services such as enabling you to view a video on our website. Disabling these Cookies means that you will be asked to reenter this information every time you use our Interactive Services.
3. Performance Cookies:
These Cookies collect information about how you use our Interactive Services such as which pages you visit regularly. They allow us to understand:
which of our Interactive Services and their functions our customers use most often so that we can use this information to improve their functionality;
your preferences to ensure that more relevant content (including advertising content) is delivered to you;
website performance such as page load and site response times, in order to monitor, identify, and fix performance issues; and
if you get error messages.
4. Content / advertising Cookies:
These cookies gather information about your use of our Interactive Services so we may improve your experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising. They are also used to gather feedback on customer satisfaction through surveys. They remember that you've visited our Interactive Services and help us understand usage of our Interactive Services and tailor advertisements to you. These Cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Some of these Cookies are from third parties that collect information about users of our Interactive Services (as described in the section titled “Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising”) in order to provide advertising (on our Interactive Services and elsewhere) based on users’ online activities (so-called "interest-based advertising") on our Services and elsewhere online.
Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising
Online behavioral advertising, also known as interest-based advertising, is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests. The third parties involved in interest-based advertising collect internet browsing information (e.g., websites visited, time of visit) across different websites and over time, and they may use the information they collect on our Interactive Services to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet. This may include information about you, such as travel destinations that you search for while using our Interactive Services. These third parties may use the information they collect on our Interactive Services to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet (for example, travel products and services that are available at a destination you searched for online). Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on online activities.
To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices, please opt out through the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative website and also through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. Your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising. If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests. American's websites do not honor web browsers' Do-Not-Track signals.

Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive advertisements. Instead, the advertising you do see will likely be less relevant to your interests. Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.
How to manage Cookies
If you do not wish to receive Cookies, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your device. You may also delete Cookies as soon as you leave our Interactive Services. Although you are not required to accept Cookies when you visit our Interactive Services, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of the Interactive Services.
For example, the Help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when new Cookies are dropped, and how to entirely disable Cookies.

How your information will be used
This content can be expanded
Our Services
We use personal information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our products and services.

®
and AAdvantage Business™ programs. We may also use personal information to verify your identity, including for security purposes.

to protect the health and safety of American’s customers and employees;
to manage and protect American’s property and the property of American’s guests and other visitors; and
for quality assurance purposes

Data security and integrity
This content can be expanded
We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information you provide to us.
American uses reasonable technical, administrative, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current. When your personal information is shared, American will take a reasonable approach to prevent the unauthorized use of personal information.
Please note, however, that while American attempts to safeguard your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
Here are some things you can do to keep your information secure.
Keep your confirmation code confidential:
When you make a booking, you will be given a 6-character confirmation code, also known as a Passenger Name Record (PNR). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your record locator confidential, as giving it to others may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others and do not want them to have access to your booking details, you should have each person make their own bookings.
Keep your AAdvantage® account number and login information confidential:
To make sure your access to our Services is secure; you should not share your log in details with anyone else. You should always log out of the Services after each use if others have access to your computer or device, especially if you are using a publicly accessible computer such as at a library or internet café. You should follow best practices for online security, such as using a different password for our Services than you do with other websites or services. American is not responsible if someone gains access to your accounts by obtaining your password.
Data retention policy
This content can be expanded
Your personal information will be retained only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above and consistent with our retention policies, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, legal requirements and the duration of your use of our website and receipt of our Services. This retention will be at least for the duration of your customer relationship with us, and a longer period as necessary for legal defense purposes or as required by tax, aviation, and other applicable laws and regulations.
We generally retain personal information related to your use of our Travel Services or Program Services for up to seven years after you complete your travel or terminate your membership with us. This includes information obtained from your use of our Interactive Services (for example, when you book, manage, or cancel travel through our websites or mobile apps).
