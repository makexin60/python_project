Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 11th March, 2024
Thank you for using Metaspace, an iOS app designed for drawing in three dimensions. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the types of information we may collect from you when you use the app, how we use that information, and the measures we take to keep it secure. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
1. Information We Collect:
Metaspace is an offline app that does not collect any personal information or data from its users. The app operates entirely locally on your device and does not send or store any information externally.
2. Offline Operation:
Metaspace operates solely on your iOS device and does not require an internet connection to function. Your drawings and creations are stored locally on your device, and the app does not transmit any data over the internet.
3. Data Storage:
All data created within the Metaspace app, including drawings, designs, and any other content, is stored locally on your iOS device. The app does not access or store data on external servers.
4. No User Accounts:
Metaspace does not require user accounts, logins, or any form of user authentication. Your usage of the app is entirely anonymous, and no personal information is collected.
5. Permissions:
Metaspace does not require any special permissions on your iOS device. The app only accesses the local storage on your device for saving and retrieving your creations.
The optional "Augmented Reality" mode on iPhone and iPad requests to use your device's back-facing camera - however this is just so that you can see your drawings in your physical environment.
6. Children's Privacy:
As the app is completely offline, it is safe for use as an educational tool by children.
7. Changes to Privacy Policy:
We reserve the right to update and modify this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes to the policy will be reflected in the app, and it is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
