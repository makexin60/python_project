Introduction
By participating in the Nectar programme in the United Kingdom (the “Programme”), we will collect and use personal data about you and any additional collectors within your account. Companies participate in the Programme by offering Nectar points (“Points”) or a place to redeem them (we call these companies “Nectar Partners”). Through participating in the Programme we will learn about what you buy, and you may receive offers and marketing from Nectar Partners, the companies whose products they sell or advertise (“Brands”) and other third parties through various Marketing Channels (by this we mean ways of receiving advertising or offers, including email, post, SMS, our Nectar app and Nectar Connect, and may include other digital channels such as websites, apps, social media and advanced TV).
This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect, the way we use it and why, the circumstances when we may share it, and your choices and rights with respect to your personal data.
What personal data do we use?
Personal data you share with us
Account Information
This is personal data such as your name, home address, email, and telephone number that you share with us when you create your Nectar account.
Transaction Information
When you shop with our Nectar Partners and use your Nectar card, e.g. when you swipe your card or buy something on an account you’ve linked with Nectar, we receive personal data about that transaction. This can include details about the transaction such as what you purchased and where you purchased it. If you use Nectar Connect, you also share transactions and transaction history related to the payment card you signed up with, you can find out more about Nectar Connect by visiting
https://www.nectar.com/about/privacy-and-legal/nectar-connect
.
Programme Analytics
This is personal data regarding how you interact with the Programme. This includes:
which offers you engage with and use
the Points redemptions you make
how you interact with and experience our websites and apps
predictions about your interests, shopping habits and characteristics – we call these “profiled characteristics”
Surveys and Market Research
This is personal data that you share with us when you take part in surveys, questionnaires or market research run by us, our Nectar Partners, or research partners.
Contact Centre Information
This is the contents of chats, calls and correspondence with our Contact Centre or with our chatbot on the Nectar website, and any associated data.
Competitions Data
When you enter competitions operated by Nectar or our Nectar Partners, you may share personal data with us, such as your entry, contact and delivery details.
Device information, cookies & similar technologies
This is personal data from devices you use to access the internet, including our services such as our websites and apps, received via e.g. cookies and other similar technologies such as pixels. This could be information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, unique IDs such as advertising IDs, location data, information about your browser, or details contained in URLs used in our communications with you (e.g. offer links in emails).
Cookies are small data files that websites or apps place on your device. To find out more about cookies and similar technologies, please visit our

Additional personal data we receive about you
Data from Nectar Partners and Brands
Nectar Partners and Brands may share personal data with us (e.g. when you link your account) which they have collected during their relationship with you. This may be information such as how you use their website and apps, your transactions with them, competitions, surveys and marketing you’ve responded to, other loyalty schemes you’ve engaged in, or profiled characteristics attributed to you from your interactions with that company.
Data from third party data companies
This is personal data that we receive or use provided by companies that provide customer information or that is publicly available. These might be companies that help us verify or update your address, or companies that provide us with information on your modelled household profile. This could be received at an individual or an anonymous level such as information based on your post code (e.g. Experian, CACI, Royal Mail).
Social Media and Digital Advertising
–
If we market to you using social media or digital advertising platforms (e.g. Google or Facebook), we may use segmentations available on those platforms to help make our marketing more relevant to you.
Anonymous data
When personal data has identifying details removed, that information can become anonymous. This can happen if we remove details such as names and addresses, or aggregate personal data into groups and keep only the information about the groups (e.g. information about people at a post code level or a report of shopping behaviour broken down by age), or when we create models from personal data that identify certain characteristics associated with certain traits (e.g. customers likelihood to buy a particular product or category).
Because we can’t identify people within anonymous data, it is treated differently from personal data and is not covered by this policy.
Pseudonymised data
Pseudonymised data is similar but slightly different from anonymous data. Although identifying details such as names and addresses are removed, it is possible to identify them by reference to a ‘key’ held separately. Pseudonymised data may be used to enhance security and privacy by enabling data to be processed at an individual level without requiring identifying details to do so. Pseudonymised data remains personal data and is covered by this policy.

How we will use your personal data, and our basis for doing so
This section explains when we process your personal data, and why we do it. In these use cases, we may use an automated decision-making process which takes into account the types of data listed in each section. For example, when using automated decision-making processes to market to you based on your Nectar profile, we might take into account Transaction Information, Account Information and Programme Analytics.
In some cases, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effects for you or affects you in a similarly significant way.
If you are seeking to exercise this right, please contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below.

Create data models
We combine the personal data we have and analyse it to look for patterns, trends and characteristics that align with a particular outcome – for example, items that are often purchased together, or popular times to redeem points. We use this analysis to create a framework that maps out these patterns, trends and characteristics on an anonymous basis - we call these frameworks “data models” and the process of making them “data modelling”.
Data modelling helps us to analyse the way that groups of people are shopping. For instance, we might look at Transaction Information at Sainsbury’s and see that buyers of ground coffee are starting to buy coffee beans or pods instead - which could be useful information for Nectar Partners who sell coffee machines.
We can then apply data models to a personalised data set, to help us tailor the offers that we show Nectar collectors. For example, sending coffee machine offers to buyers of instant coffee.
In some circumstances we also share personal data with Nectar Partners to enable them to create their own models. Please see the “Who will we share your personal data with?” section for further details.

)
(referred to collectively in this policy as ‘Sainsbury’s Bank’) to enable them to create data models designed to indicate a shopper’s credit worthiness and insurance risk. Sainsbury’s Bank creates those models by combining datasets of Transaction Information at Sainsbury’s, Argos, Habitat and Tu with datasets such as credit worthiness and credit performance data or insurance performance data. They apply the data models they create to personal data we share with them to offer Nectar collectors a more convenient product (such as pre-approval for credit) or, with your consent, to give you a better deal on a financial product such as credit or insurance.
From time to time we may also enter partnerships which mean that we share more data than is set out above.

Nectar Connect Terms & Conditions
Important Privacy Information
About Nectar Connect and your data
In order to take part in Nectar Connect, we, Nectar360 Limited collect certain information about you when you link an eligible debit card or credit card account to Nectar Connect. The information we collect is set out below. We also work with certain third parties: Cardlytics UK Limited (Cardlytics) who act as our data processor and TrueLayer Limited (TrueLayer) who act as a service provider and separate data controller. By you participating in Nectar Connect we can:
Provide you with Nectar points offers based on your everyday spend; and
Work out which offers you have used in order for you to automatically qualify for your Nectar points.
The sections below contain more important privacy information regarding Nectar Connect, and this information is supplemental to the standard Nectar Privacy Policy which can be found here:
www.nectar.com/about/privacy-and-legal
The information we collect
Once you join Nectar Connect we work with Cardlytics and TrueLayer, enabled by Open Banking:
https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/
. This means that we are able to link your debit card and / or credit card transactions to your Nectar account in a secure way [that recognises you using a pseudonymised ID rather than personally sensitive identifiers that humans would recognise].
We only collect and use the minimum amount of information including transaction data required to operate the Nectar Connect programme, as summarised in the two tables below:
Table 1.
The debit card / credit card account data that we do collect:
A unique ID
This ID relates to the payment account you link to your Nectar account (this is not the same as the bank account number and is used purely for the purposes of this Nectar Connect scheme)
Bank name
The issuing bank for your credit or debit card e.g. Lloyds, Barclays, Monzo
Account type
The type of account you hold e.g. current, savings, credit card
Account name
The product name of the account you hold e.g. ‘Classic Current Account’, ‘Regular Saver’, ‘Platinum Credit Card’
Transaction specific information
Date & Time of transaction
Description of transaction
(merchant & category e.g. grocery)
Type of transaction
(purchase, direct debit, cashback, refund credit)
Transaction amount.
Table 2.
The debit card / credit card account data that we do not collect:
Personal information
Your name & address
Your account number & card number
Personal financial circumstances information
Account balance
Credit history or credit worthiness
Non-merchant transactions
ATM withdrawals, standing orders & cheque payments
Incoming transactions
Salary, pension & other payments received
After you link your payment card account(s) to Nectar as part of Nectar Connect we receive between 6 to 36 months of your historical transaction data, depending on your payment card. This allows us to see where and when you have shopped previously, and this history (along with your ongoing payment transactions) is used to personalise the targeted merchant offers you receive as part of Nectar Connect.
We take the security of your data seriously and we have read-only access to your payments transaction data. This means we cannot make any changes to your bank account, or change the data provided to us, or make any payments on your behalf.
How to de-link accounts
We will continue to collect your ongoing payment transactions on a daily basis until such time that you de-link your payment account from Nectar Connect. You can do this at any time by visiting your Nectar Connect account page and selecting the payment account you wish to de-link. From the point that you de-link your payment account we will no longer be able to collect any future payments transaction data. And after de-linking, the payments transaction data held by Nectar will be deleted after 37 months and held in anonymised form by Cardlytics for 7 years. After de-linking, should you wish for payments transaction data held by Nectar to be deleted earlier than 37 months, please contact [
privacy@sainsburys.co.uk
] quoting 'Ref: Nectar Connect'.
How my information is used
The payment transaction data we access will be added to your Nectar profile, so we can analyse and understand your shopping behaviour over time and target you with relevant offers from Nectar & our partners. An example of shopping behaviour we may look at could be how much you spend at different brands within a particular sector (e.g. grocery or fuel). An example of targeting could be to send you points offers to shop differently (e.g. to shop more with Sainsbury’s or Esso and less with their competitors).
Further information on how we use Nectar data can be found in our Privacy Policy which can be found here:
www.nectar.com/about/privacy-and-legal
Third Parties we work with to run Nectar Connect
We work with two third parties to provide Nectar Connect.
Cardlytics UK Limited - Our partner and data processor is Cardlytics who are a provider of online and mobile banking rewards programmes in the UK enabling us to identify and provide you with your personalised offers. They act as our processor and analyse the transaction data you share with us to facilitate Nectar Connect and provide analytics to merchants to help them bring the best offers to you.

Additional Terms and Conditions for Nectar Connect
Nectar Connect offers & earning points
Nectar points are awarded by Nectar and not the retailer / merchant so please contact us if you believe points have been incorrectly awarded to your account or if you believe you are due points which have not been issued.
Nectar Connect offers may be available for a limited period, subject to availability and alteration. Check back regularly to see what is new.
Each offer can only be used once, unless otherwise indicated in the offer terms & conditions. Offers are not transferrable. You will need to activate an offer by clicking on it before you can use it, and you will need to make the relevant transaction on or before the expiry date of the offer in order to collect Nectar points.
If you share a joint bank account and both of you link this account to your individual Nectar accounts, when it comes to Nectar Connect offers the first person to activate and use an offer will receive the points into their Nectar account.
Your points will be awarded (based on the calculated spend and points offer value) after your purchase has been confirmed. We typically award the points you have collected within 28 days of the transaction.
These Additional Terms and Conditions are in addition to the standard Nectar terms and conditions which you have already agreed to as a member of the Nectar Loyalty Programme. Please find them in full here:

About the TrueLayer Terms of Service
We (Nectar) work with TrueLayer (an FCA authorised account information service provider and our authorised data controller) who act as a messenger of your account data between us and your bank, allowing you to share your data with us so we can view your transactions for any payment card account(s) you link to Nectar Connect.

Before you continue…
As part of Nectar Connect, we will be able to view the payment transactions and transaction history of any debit card or credit card that you link to Nectar.
This account linking and viewing of payment transaction data is required for us to operate Nectar Connect.
This data will be added to your Nectar profile, so we can analyse and understand your shopping behaviour over time and target you with relevant offers from Nectar & our partners.
To provide our service, Nectar Connect works with TrueLayer to securely connect to your bank account. By continuing, you are giving TrueLayer permission to retrieve the account and transaction data outlined above and share it with Nectar Connect.
