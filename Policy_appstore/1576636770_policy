Privacy on the internet is a major concern, so these apps reflect my policy. Nothing is collected by me, and you have complete control over your own data.
SamuraiSafe
The SamuraiSafe app does not transmit or retain any private data outside your macOS or iOS device.
SamuraiSafe is however supported by the Apple macOS and iOS platforms, in order to function,
and these platforms may collect data based upon their respective privacy settings.
If you have enabled iCloud Drive, and have created an iCloud safe, your encrypted  safe is
shared with your other devices, via iCloud servers. Responsibility for privacy and security
within iCloud resides with Apple. Your private safe key never leaves your device.
SamuraiSafe does not use any analytics or logging except that provided by the
underlying Apple platforms.
For example, as a developer, I have access to aggregated statistics related to the purchase
and number of uses of SamuraiSafe (if you have agreed to share analytics in privacy settings).
Samurai Search

Samurai Search is however supported by the Apple  iOS platform, in order to function,
