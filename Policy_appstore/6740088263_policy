• Images are immediately and securely transmitted to our AI processing partner (Replicate) and are only held in temporary memory during transmission.
• Once the image is processed and the result is delivered to you, no facial data is retained anywhere in our system.
Use of Face Data
• Facial images are used solely for generating AI-enhanced headshots through Replicate's AI service.
• The processing is temporary and occurs in real-time.
• We do not use face data for any other purposes such as identification, authentication, or marketing.
Third-Party Processing
• We use Replicate's AI services to generate the headshots.
• Images are transmitted securely to Replicate for processing.
• We do not sell, rent, or share your face data with any other third parties.
• For information about how Replicate handles data, please refer to their privacy policy.
Data Security
• All data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
