Bones of the body is meant to rapidly teach you the names of all the bones in the body in both English and Latin. The design is based on the notion that a task that too easy will be boring and one that’s too hard will be frustrating. Since everyone differs in their previous knowledge and learning speed Bones of the body adapts the difficulty based on the users progress.
Bones of the body does not store or collect personal information.
Availabe for iPhone and iPad on the App store.
