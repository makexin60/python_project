. In the preceding 12 months, we disclosed certain personal data from the following categories of personal information to the categories of recipients listed in the Section entitled THIRD-PARTY RECIPIENTS OF PERSONAL DATA of our Privacy Notice, such as our service providers, for one or more business purposes as described in that Section above.
We disclose the above categories of personal data to service providers to fulfill the business purposes, such as:
Maintaining and servicing your account;
Providing you customer service;
Processing transactions;
Processing applications and payments;
Verifying the identity of users;
Detecting and preventing fraud;
Providing loyalty and promotional programs;
Providing marketing and advertising services;
Providing analytics services; and
Undertaking internal research to develop our services.
Please note that when we disclose personal data for a business purpose to a third party, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal data confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.
Do Not Track
. California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently is no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
Third Party Marketing
. If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1789.83 permits you to request (once per calendar year) information regarding the disclosure of your personal data (if any) to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal data shared and the names and addresses of any third parties with whom such personal data was shared in the immediately preceding calendar year.
