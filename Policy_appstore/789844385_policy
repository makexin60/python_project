Our Legal Basis for Collecting Personal Information
Whenever we collect Personal Information from you, we may do so on the following legal bases:
Your consent to such collection and use;
Out of necessity for the performance of an agreement between us and you, such as your agreement to use our Services or your request for Services;
Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where collecting or using Personal Information is necessary for:
Intra-organization transfers for administrative purposes;
Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables TickPick to enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our Services and communications for the benefit of our visitors, and to better understand how people interact with our Sites;
Fraud detection and prevention;
Enhancement of our cybersecurity, including improving the security of our network and information systems; and
General business operations and diligence.
Provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.
When You Choose Not to Provide Personal Information
Your provision of Personal Information is required in order to use certain Services and programs. In some instances, if you do not provide such Personal Information, you may not be able to access and use our Services, or parts of our Services.
Our Retention of Your Personal Information
We use and retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it is being processed, to carry out legitimate business interests, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Information will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.
The criteria we use to determine the retention period is as follows:
whether there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require us to retain the data for a period of time;
whether there is an ongoing legal claim that relates to any business (or otherwise) relationship you have with us, or that is otherwise related to your relationship with us;
whether any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period; and
whether the Personal Information is considered to be sensitive Personal Information, in which case a shorter retention period generally would be applied.
These criteria may also mean we adjust the period of time we retain the categories of Personal Information detailed above.
Disclosing Personal Information
TickPick may disclose any of the categories of Personal Information listed above for our business and commercial purposes as described below and for any other purpose disclosed when you provide the information.
To our affiliates and service providers.

or
Call +1 (888) 443-6673 to submit your request.
You can exercise your right to opt-out of selling or sharing by clicking on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in the footer of our Site.
You may also designate an agent to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.
Upon receiving your request, we will confirm receipt of your request by sending you an email confirming receipt.

We will aim to respond to your request as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with any applicable laws. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, listed below, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.
California residents are also entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Our Legal Basis for Collecting Personal Information
Whenever we collect Personal Information from you, we may do so on the following legal bases:
Your consent to such collection and use;

Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where collecting or using Personal Information is necessary for:
Intra-organization transfers for administrative purposes;
Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables TickPick to enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our Services and communications for the benefit of our visitors, and to better understand how people interact with our Sites;
Fraud detection and prevention;
Enhancement of our cybersecurity, including improving the security of our network and information systems; and
General business operations and diligence.
Provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.
When You Choose Not to Provide Personal Information
Your provision of Personal Information is required in order to use certain Services and programs. In some instances, if you do not provide such Personal Information, you may not be able to access and use our Services, or parts of our Services.
Our Retention of Your Personal Information
We use and retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it is being processed, to carry out legitimate business interests, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).
After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Information will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.
The criteria we use to determine the retention period is as follows:
whether there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require us to retain the data for a period of time;
whether there is an ongoing legal claim that relates to any business (or otherwise) relationship you have with us, or that is otherwise related to your relationship with us;
whether any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period; and
whether the Personal Information is considered to be sensitive Personal Information, in which case a shorter retention period generally would be applied.
These criteria may also mean we adjust the period of time we retain the categories of Personal Information detailed above.
Disclosing Personal Information
TickPick may disclose any of the categories of Personal Information listed above for our business and commercial purposes as described below and for any other purpose disclosed when you provide the information.
To our affiliates and service providers.

You can exercise your right to opt-out of selling or sharing by clicking on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in the footer of our Site.
You may also designate an agent to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.

If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process Personal Information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, listed below, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.

9.Buyers: Finding Tickets and Placing Orders
9.1 Fees
To purchase tickets, a Buyer may search for events and/or browse TickPick's listings for tickets via the Platform. If you purchase tickets on the Platform, you understand that such purchase will result in fees, charges, and other expenses to you for such tickets (“Fees”), which may include, among other things, (a) the price for the tickets (the “Ticket Fees”) and (b) platform, transaction, or other commissions or related fees for using the Platform (“Transaction Fees”). All payments for Fees will be processed by TickPick and/or its payment processor, using your Payment Method.  When you purchase any tickets on the Platform, you are solely responsible for payment of the Fees and any additional fees or charges that may be incurred from your bank, card issuer, or financial institution.  By committing to the purchase, you are entering into a binding contract with the Seller to purchase the selected tickets. All such purchases are final and, once placed, cannot be cancelled or retracted by the Buyer. However, placing an order does not complete the sale; a sale is only completed once it has been confirmed by the Seller. In all cases, the submission and confirmation of orders are transactions between Buyers and Sellers only. When an order is placed, it can take up to forty-eight (48) hours for the acceptance of that sale to be confirmed.
9.2 Payment
The Buyer's Payment Method is not charged until the Buyer's order is confirmed by the Seller. However, when a Buyer places an order, we obtain an authorization from the Buyer's card provider for the full order amount, which is equal to the total purchase price displayed to the Buyer at the completion of the purchasing process. The authorization remains on the Buyer's Payment Method until the sale is completed when the Seller confirms the order or the order is cancelled. Although an authorization is not a charge, debit card providers will place a hold on funds when an authorization is obtained by TickPick. In all cases, TickPick is not responsible for any bank fees or other penalties resulting from authorizations and/or charges to the Buyer's Payment Method when the Buyer places an order.
As a Buyer, you grant TickPick permission to charge your Payment Method for the purchase of tickets.  The terms of your Payment Method agreement governs your use of the Payment Method, and you must refer to those terms and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing TickPick with your Payment Method, you agree that TickPick is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all Fees due and payable to TickPick hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify TickPick of any change in the details of your Payment Method.  It is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date.
You must notify TickPick in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be sent to the following address:
support@TickPick.com
As a Buyer, you may have an option to purchase tickets through a flexible payment provider identified on the TickPick Platform.  Such flexible payment provider may facilitate a payment plan for your tickets.  By using the payment plan, you are agreeing to allow the flexible payment provider to process your Payment Method for the dollar amounts on the schedule that you have selected. If the Payment Method expires or lacks the necessary funds during your plan, it is your responsibility to update it prior to the next payment or risk order cancellation and fees.  Additionally, by purchasing tickets through the flexible payment provider, you are also agreeing to the terms and conditions of the flexible payment provider.  It is your responsibility to read and understand such terms.  TickPick is not responsible for any fees or failure to receive tickets as a result of your failure to comply with the terms of the flexible payment provider.
9.3 Purchase of Tickets
After a Buyer places an order to purchase tickets, it is possible that the Seller no longer has the tickets available for sale. In this case, the Buyer's Payment Method will not be charged and the sale will be cancelled. Upon the Seller confirming the sale, the Buyer is guaranteed to receive the tickets in time for the event. However, Buyer understands that once an order is confirmed, the delivery and shipment of tickets is the responsibility of the Seller. TickPick cannot guarantee the method or time of the delivery for a given sale, only that the tickets will be delivered in time for the event. TickPick does not control, and has no right to control, the Seller’s delivery and/or shipment of tickets.
9.4: Seat Views/Quality and Ticket Details
The seat views provided by TickPick for a given section reflects the view from that location in general and is not specific to any one ticket listing within that section.
TickPick is not responsible for the quality of the specific seat or for the seat location if the venue changes the seating configuration or layout.
Tickets may be substituted with comparable or better seat locations by the Seller. Actual seat and row numbers may vary from those purchased on the Platform. It is at TickPick’s sole determination whether substituted tickets are comparable or better seat locations. Additionally, TickPick does not guarantee any information provided by any Sellers in the “Seller Notes” area of the ticket listings.
Event dates, times, venues, and performers, which are listed on the ticket, may change. It is the responsibility of the Buyer to verify the most recent details for an event. Please contact the box office or refer to local listings for any changes. TickPick is not responsible for these changes or for partial performances and as such, no refunds or credits will be issued.
Unless otherwise expressly stated by TickPick, the display of any tickets or sellers on our website does not in any way imply, suggest or constitute an endorsement by us of those tickets or that seller, or any sponsorship of us by such seller, or any other affiliation between such seller and us.
9.5 Ticket Prices
The face value printed on the ticket and/or the original price of the ticket may not be the same as the purchased price or the cost of the transaction. Ticket prices are set by the Seller. TickPick does not own ticket inventory or set ticket prices. As a result, the ticket prices listed may be higher or lower than the price printed on and/or the original price of the ticket.
The face value for a ticket available for sale may be provided on the Platform, in accordance with applicable law. In those instances, we can only provide the face value the Seller provides to TickPick. TickPick cannot assess or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of such information provided by Seller.
Buyers should be aware that ticket prices for live events continue to fluctuate on the open market. It is possible that prices of similar seats will change over time; if the prices of similar tickets increase prior to the event, you will not be charged more. Conversely, if the price of similar tickets decreases prior to the event, no credits, refunds or upgrades will be given for tickets previously purchased. TickPick will never charge more than what you have authorized. All prices are listed in U.S. dollars.
In some instances, a Price Freeze may be applicable to ticket prices, as set forth in the Price Freeze Terms and Conditions available
here
, which are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement.
9.6 BestPrice Guarantee
TickPick offers a
BestPrice Guarantee
to the Buyer for qualifying purchases, which is incorporated into and forms a part of this Agreement. This guarantee takes effect only after the Seller has confirmed acceptance and the Buyer's Payment Method has been charged.  The instructions for submitting a BestPrice Guarantee Claim are available
here
.  Any claims submitted for the BestPrice Guarantee must meet all the conditions set by TickPick to be eligible to receive any credit, including, without limitation, the following:
(a)
The lower price is based on the final checkout page price on a ticket marketplace other than TickPick. When taking your screenshot, please ensure it displays all fees and taxes. Taxes are not included when comparing the pricing of tickets;
(b)
The lower price must be found and screenshot with a timestamp within 30 minutes of your purchase with TickPick;
(c)
The lower price you found must be for the same event, the same date(s), and the same section, row, and quantity that you purchased on TickPick;
(d)
The lower price must be available to the general public. AARP rates, AAA rates, military rates, corporate rates, etc, do not apply;
(e)
Various prices are not valid as a “lower price” for this BestPrice Guarantee, including but not limited to:
(i)
Prices offered through loyalty programs or membership programs (in each case, paid or unpaid), through contests or as a part of a travel package;
(ii)
Prices that require a login, credit card number, or code to view;
(iii)
Prices that are not bookable, such as some advertisements;
(iv)
Prices offered through government programs or offers;
(v)
Prices obtained through the usage of promo or coupon;
(vi)
Prices obtained as part of a lottery, rush program, or similar promotion;
(vii)
Prices from apps or websites where you don’t know the event until after booking, prices from websites/apps where you name your own price, and prices you must call in for;
(viii)
Prices from professional ticket resellers (those who buy and sell tickets on a regular basis, as determined by TickPick in its sole discretion);
(ix)
Credit issued as part of a claim expire 365 days after issuance if they are not used; and
(x)
Prices that are reflective of unauthorized reselling of a confirmed ticket reservation made in someone else’s name;
(f)
TickPick may deny any suspicious or fraudulent claims.
(g)
The BestPrice Guarantee does not apply in the event of disasters, acts of terrorism, or other events outside of TickPick’s control.
(h)
TickPick caps the amount of TickPick Credit(s) that can be issued as part of a claim at $200.
Under its sole discretion, TickPick reserves the right to deny any BestPrice Guarantee Claim due to any failure to follow instructions provided by TickPick, including the provision of any inaccurate information associated with your claim.
9.7 Ticket Discrepancies
Subsequent to the receipt of tickets, it is the Buyer's responsibility to verify any possible inconsistency or discrepancy in the ticket location, description, and/or price by calling TickPick as soon as possible following the discovery of such a discrepancy. Use of a ticket without reporting a discrepancy to TickPick constitutes acceptance of the ticket as is, notwithstanding any inconsistency with the Seller's listing and the actual ticket.
As noted in our
BuyerTrust Guarantee
, which is incorporated into and forms a part of this Agreement, if there are any issues or discrepancies with the tickets that you receive from what you purchased, TickPick may, at its sole discretion, find comparable or better replacement tickets. If replacement tickets cannot be found or are not available at a comparable price, TickPick reserves the right to cancel the order and refund to you the full purchase price. We may require that you return to us the tickets you initially received.
If a Seller notifies TickPick of a pricing error when listing tickets for sale, TickPick will use their sole discretion to decide whether it is appropriate to cancel a sale and excuse the seller from fulfilling the sale. This is most commonly caused when a seller forgets a digit (ex: $40 vs $140) or reverses the digits (ex: $260 vs $620) when setting the price on a listing but can be the result of other errors as well. In these cases, whether an order is confirmed or not, TickPick in its sole discretion, reserves the right to cancel the sale and provide the Buyer with a credit or refund.
9.8: Right to Cancel Transaction.
In certain circumstances, we may cancel a ticket transaction (whether a purchase, listing, and/or transfer) without notice and return the tickets to the Seller or to the individual who held the tickets prior to the completion of the transaction. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
if an event is canceled without being rescheduled;
(b)
if the Buyer’s Payment Method does not remit payment;
(c)
if we suspect, in our sole discretion, unauthorized or fraudulent use of a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee’s account with us;
(d)
if a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee breaches these Terms of Use;
(e)
if we deem, in our sole discretion, that a ticket transaction violates the law;
(f)
if there is an error in the pricing of a ticket offered for sale through the TickPick Platform; and/or
(g)
if we believe, in our sole discretion, that a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee has otherwise engaged in inappropriate conduct in connection with a ticket transaction.
9.9: Attending Events
When attending an event, you may be required to sign a waiver or other legal document to gain access to the venue by the venue or event organizer or such party’s agent. By purchasing tickets from TickPick, you understand that you may be denied entry if you do not sign such waiver.
We encourage the purchase of travel insurance for any event. If you are not permitted into an event, or are otherwise unable to attend an event, for any reason other than due to the invalidity of the tickets you receive, TickPick is not responsible, and you will not qualify for a refund or any other form of compensation.  TickPick has no obligation to credit or refund (and will not credit or refund) incidental expenses that you have incurred relating to your plans to attend the event including, but not limited to, plane or transportation expenses, hotel reservations, or rental car costs.
10. Text Message Policy

11. Event Cancellation, Postponement, or Rescheduling
If an event is cancelled and not postponed or rescheduled, we will provide a Credit (defined below) or refund to Buyer, as determined in TickPick's sole discretion (except to the extent a refund is required by law), for the full Fee paid by Buyer for the respective tickets. Tickets must be returned by Buyer, in the manner and within the timeline as directed by TickPick, to obtain a Credit or refund.
If an event is postponed or rescheduled, please retain your ticket. In most cases, the original purchased ticket will be honored for the new event date. New tickets will not need to be reissued for most rescheduled or postponed events. Credits, refunds or exchanges will not be made for postponed or rescheduled events.
TickPick assumes no responsibility for the actions of any event organizing body when an event or tickets is cancelled, postponed or rescheduled.
12. Credits
TickPick may offer promotional codes, discount credits, or other types of credits (“Credits”).  Credits can only be used with a registered Account. Credits will expire as stated in the offer.  If no expiration term is stated, Credits will expire no later than one year after issuance.  Credits are for one-time use only and may not be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published either directly or indirectly in any form.  TickPick reserves the right to deactivate any unused Credits for any reason.  If you are given a choice between a refund or a Credit, once that decision has been made it cannot be switched. In some instances, a Credit Boost may be available as set forth in the Credit Boost Terms available
here
, which are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement.
13. Taxes
TickPick collects and remits sales tax in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Sales tax is identified separately on purchases by consumers.

20. ARBITRATION
THIS SECTION TITLED “ARBITRATION” SETS FORTH THE TERMS OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TickPick
. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TickPick AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
20.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION
. YOU AGREE TO GIVE TickPick AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES INFORMALLY BY SENDING TickPick WRITTEN NOTICE. IF YOU ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST TickPick, YOU WILL FIRST CONTACT TickPick BY SENDING WRITTEN NOTICE (“CLAIMANT NOTICE”) TO

YOU AGREE TO GIVE TickPick AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE THROUGH AN INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF A CLAIMANT NOTICE. IF WE CANNOT REACH AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER EMAIL RECEIPT OF A CLAIMANT NOTICE, THEN YOU SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS SET FORTH BELOW. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND ANY FILING FEE DEADLINES SHALL BE TOLLED FOR SIXTY (60) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT EITHER YOU OR TickPick RECEIVE A CLAIMANT OR TickPick NOTICE SO THAT THE PARTIES CAN ENGAGE IN THIS INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS.
20.2 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
: SUBJECT TO SECTION 20.1, YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THE TickPick, TO ANY PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE TickPick, OR TO ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TickPick, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT (A) YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY; AND (B) YOU OR TickPick MAY SEEK EQUITABLE RELIEF IN COURT FOR INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (SUCH AS TRADEMARKS, TRADE DRESS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PATENTS). THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL APPLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ALL CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT OR ANY PRIOR VERSION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
20.3 ARBITRATION RULES AND FORUM
: SUBJECT TO SECTION 20.1, THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY JAMS, AN ESTABLISHED ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVIDER. DISPUTES INVOLVING CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS UNDER $250,000, NOT INCLUSIVE OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND INTEREST, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO JAMS'S MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THE STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.JAMSADR.COM/RULES-STREAMLINED-ARBITRATION/; ALL OTHER CLAIMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO JAMS'S MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.JAMSADR.COM/RULES-COMPREHENSIVE-ARBITRATION/. JAMS'S RULES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AT WWW.JAMSADR.COM OR BY CALLING JAMS AT 800-352-5267. IF JAMS IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ARBITRATE, THE PARTIES WILL SELECT AN ALTERNATIVE ARBITRAL FORUM. IF THE ARBITRATOR FINDS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY JAMS'S FILING, ADMINISTRATIVE, HEARING AND/OR OTHER FEES AND CANNOT OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM JAMS, TickPick WILL PAY THEM FOR YOU. IN ADDITION, TickPick WILL REIMBURSE ALL SUCH JAMS'S FILING, ADMINISTRATIVE, HEARING AND/OR OTHER FEES FOR CLAIMS TOTALING LESS THAN $10,000 UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THE CLAIMS ARE FRIVOLOUS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE, BASED ON WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS, OR IN PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE OR AT ANOTHER MUTUALLY AGREED LOCATION. ANY JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
20.4 AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR
: SUBJECT TO SECTION 20.1, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO (A) DETERMINE THE SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND (B) RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THE INTERPRETATION, APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR FORMATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS VOID OR VOIDABLE. THE ARBITRATION WILL DECIDE THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES, IF ANY, OF YOU AND TickPick. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WILL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER MATTERS OR JOINED WITH ANY OTHER CASES OR PARTIES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT MOTIONS DISPOSITIVE OF ALL OR PART OF ANY CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD MONETARY DAMAGES AND TO GRANT ANY NON-MONETARY REMEDY OR RELIEF AVAILABLE TO AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE ARBITRAL FORUM'S RULES, AND THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT). THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ISSUE A WRITTEN AWARD AND STATEMENT OF DECISION DESCRIBING THE ESSENTIAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ON WHICH THE AWARD IS BASED, INCLUDING THE CALCULATION OF ANY DAMAGES AWARDED. THE ARBITRATOR HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY TO AWARD RELIEF ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THAT A JUDGE IN A COURT OF LAW WOULD HAVE. THE AWARD OF THE ARBITRATOR IS FINAL AND BINDING UPON YOU AND US.
20.5 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
: YOU AND TickPick HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. YOU AND TickPick ARE INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 20.2 ABOVE. AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT AND MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AS A COURT WOULD. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW.
20.6 WAIVER OF CLASS OR OTHER NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF
: ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

Terms & Conditions: TickPick Price Freeze
Last Updated on Jan 3, 2023
TickPick’s “Price Freeze” grants the purchaser the right to purchase from TickPick a ticket for a specified event (“Qualifying Event”) at a specified (“Frozen”) price for a specified period of time, subject to availability, any applicable Credit Cap, and the Terms hereunder. Subject to the Terms below, the price of available Qualifying Tickets may be Frozen for a temporary period of time (the “Price Freeze”). TickPick offers Price Freeze to provide Qualifying Purchasers a more flexible purchasing experience through its mobile application (“Application”). By utilizing Price Freeze, you agree to these TickPick Price Freeze Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). Your use of TickPick’s Price Freeze is subject to the TickPick
User Agreement
. Any capitalized terms used herein that are undefined have the meaning given to such term in the User Agreement. Violation of these Terms can lead to Account suspension or termination.
TickPick may modify any of these Terms at any time, with or without notice to you, subject to applicable law
. In the event of a change in these Terms, we shall post a revised version of these Terms here, which shall automatically replace the terms of any previous terms posted here. Your continued use of TickPick.com and TickPick's Services, as defined in the User Agreement, following the posting of revised terms will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms. If you don't agree with the User Agreement or these Terms, do not continue to use TickPick.com or TickPick's services.
1. Price Freeze Eligibility
You will be able to participate in the Price Freeze program if you are a Qualifying Purchaser. To become a “Qualifying Purchaser”, you must be a registered user of the TickPick Application, and that registered user Account must have either previously completed a purchase of tickets or performed other actions on the Platform as required. If a registered user is a Qualifying Purchaser, you will be able to utilize the Price Freeze functionality (“Event Freeze Window”) through the Application, subject to the terms herein.
2. Events Eligible for Price Freeze
An event is available for Price Freeze if it is a Qualifying Event. A “Qualifying Event” is an event occurring in no sooner than two (2) days from the time of selecting Price Freeze. Only one Qualifying Event can be Frozen by you at any one time. Only Qualifying Tickets available at the time of the Price Freeze will be Frozen for the Qualifying Event. “Qualifying Tickets” will be noted by a representative icon next to the price of the tickets when a Qualifying Event is viewed. Only tickets with these representative icons are Qualifying Tickets. TickPick will not be responsible for errors made by you when selecting the Qualifying Event for Price Freeze.
3. Price Frozen Qualifying Event
When you have Frozen a Qualifying Event, TickPick is not guaranteeing that Qualifying Tickets for the Qualifying Event will be available for purchase through the Event Freeze Window. Those tickets are the property of the Seller and TickPick has no control over the tickets that are available at any point in time. In addition, tickets may be added to Qualifying Events during the Event Freeze Window which would not be subject to the Price Freeze.
4. Event Freeze Window
After you have Frozen a Qualifying Event, and up until twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of the event, the price of available Qualifying Tickets will be Frozen (the “Price Freeze”). After twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of the event the Price Freeze will expire. Qualifying Tickets will be only available for purchase at the then current price. If the Price Frozen Qualifying Event is cancelled, postponed, or rescheduled, the Price Freeze will no longer apply to those tickets or that event.
5. Purchase
At the time of purchase, when a Qualifying Ticket is priced lower with the Price Freeze than the current price of the ticket, you will pay the current price of the ticket and a Credit (discussed in greater detail under the User Terms) will be issued (“Issued Credit”) for the difference between the current price and the Frozen price, up until the maximum Credit Cap, will be credited to your registered user account. Purchases are limited to one transaction per Price Frozen Qualifying Event. If you do not (or are unable) to purchase the Qualifying Ticket, you will not be eligible for any credit.
6. Credit Cap
The Credit Cap is equal to a maximum of twenty-five dollars ($25) per ticket and a maximum of fifty dollars ($50) per transaction.
7. Credit Issued
The Credit Issued will be added to your registered user account after the purchase, if applicable based on qualifying terms previously mentioned. Credits will expire 1 year after receipt if not used toward a purchase within that time.
8. Cancellation
You can cancel a Price Freeze on any active Price Frozen Qualifying Event at any time.
9. Price Freeze Not Available for Certain Events or Tickets
Due to the nature of certain events and tickets for events, the Price Freeze offering may not be available for all events, even if such events would otherwise be considered Qualifying Events or where tickets would otherwise be considered Qualifying Tickets. TickPick reserves the right to make those determinations at its sole discretion. Price Freeze may not be used in combination with other promotions and programs.
The BestPrice Guarantee is not applicable to Price Freeze Qualifying Tickets
.
10. Not Insurance
The terms of this service are not intended to constitute an offer to insure, do not constitute insurance or an insurance contract, and do not replace any insurance obtained or available to be obtained by you.
11. Additional Support
Please contact our customer support through our
Help Center
.
Last Updated on April 29, 2024
These Supplemental Terms (“Terms”) apply to all users of TickPick’s Platform (including any Services) acting as Sellers of tickets who are not participating in our Large Sellers Program. As used herein, a user who is a resident of either the US or Canada and wants to sell tickets may list the tickets on TickPick as a “Seller.”
These Terms are subject to the TickPick
User Agreement
. Any capitalized terms used herein that are undefined have the meaning given to such term in the User Agreement. Violation of these Supplemental Terms can lead to Account suspension or termination.
TickPick may modify any of these Terms at any time, with or without notice to you, subject to applicable law
. In the event of a change in these Terms, we shall post a revised version of these Terms here, which shall automatically replace any previous terms posted here. Your continued use of TickPick.com and TickPick's Services, as defined in the User Agreement, following the posting of any revised Terms will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you don't agree with the User Agreement or the Terms, do not continue to use TickPick.com or TickPick's services.
1. Listing Tickets for Sale
As part of the listing process, the Seller must provide accurate information such as the event description, date, section, row, and seat. Sellers must also ensure that such listings remain accurate. A Seller who lists a ticket for sale on the Platform either chooses to sell that ticket for a fixed price or to use an automatic pricing tool when available on the Platform. Fixed pricing can be raised or lower so long as a Buyer has not purchased the tickets.
Sellers are required to disclose if the tickets state that it is a limited or obstructed view, wheelchair only, wheelchair accessible, alcohol-free, 21 and over, or behind or side stage, and any other information that may be relevant to a Buyer. Some information is legally required for certain venues such as the face value of the ticket. Seller must provide such legally required information. Once submitted, the tickets will be available for immediate purchase by a Buyer.
1.1 Restrictions on Listing Tickets for Sale
Sellers are expressly forbidden from listing for sale:
(a)
if the seller is not a resident of the United States or Canada;
(b)
tickets that the Seller does not own, have in-hand, or that have been allocated to them (“Speculative Tickets”);
(c)
tickets obtained in violation of the Better Online Ticket Sales Act of 2016 (i.e., obtained via circumvention of a security measure, access control system, or other technological control or measure on an Internet website or online service that is used by a ticket issuer to enforce posted event ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online ticket purchasing order rules);
(d)
stolen tickets;
(e)
"local pick-up” and "will-call only" tickets;
(f)
tickets without event access unless clearly stated in the listing (e.g., "PARKING ONLY");
(g)
non-consecutive seats; or
(h)
tickets otherwise invalid or prohibited to be sold by law. 
				Sellers agree not to place any personal information (including, but not limited to, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses) in the Seller Comments area of ticket listings.
1.2 Optional Features
The “Credit Boost” feature enables the Seller to increase the visibility of the listing by offering a 5% credit to the buyer. Credit Boost is applicable to ticket listings of $50 or above for eligible events. The amount of the issued credit will be deducted from the Seller's payout.
The "AutoPrice" feature enables the Seller to automate pricing on their ticket listings for eligible events. The AutoPrice system evaluates ticket prices every hour, adjusting them higher or lower at the Platform’s sole discretion. The Seller does not receive notifications for each price change; however, in the event that the inventory is deemed insufficient for effective use of AutoPrice, the Seller will be notified via email, and the AutoPrice feature will be disabled for the affected listing. The Seller acknowledges that the Platform is not responsible for potential losses that may arise from these automated adjustments and no minimum sale price is guaranteed. These terms and conditions are subject to modification, and the continued use of AutoPrice signifies agreement to these terms.
Both the Credit Boost and AutoPrice features will remain active until the event start time, until the listing is removed, or until the Seller removes the feature from the listing.
The “FanLink” feature enables the Seller to create a shareable checkout link with a specific FanLink price to sell their tickets outside the normal purchase path on TickPick. If a ticket is sold through FanLink, the Seller will be paid out 85% of the FanLink price per ticket sold, within the same timeframe as any other TickPick sale. Additionally, the Seller will receive a TickPick credit worth 15% of the FanLink sale value, usable towards future purchases on TickPick. This credit is valid for 90 days following the sale's payout. The Seller can create or edit a FanLink at any time before their listing is sold or removed.
The Credit Boost, AutoPrice, and FanLink features will remain active until the event start time, until the listing is removed, or until the Seller removes the feature from the listing.
2. Completing Your Sale
When your tickets sell, you are contractually obligated to accept the offer and are bound to deliver the exact listed tickets within the stated time frame (and, in any case, within a timely manner prior to the event) for the price listed. Upon receipt of a purchase by a Buyer, you will receive a notification from TickPick. You must confirm the order in a timely manner, and may not modify or cancel the ticket listing, or otherwise attempt to stop the sale.
Completing a sale means following all the steps to send the purchased tickets, on time and as promised in your listing. The fulfillment of confirmed orders, including delivery of tickets, is the responsibility of the Seller.
2.1 Busted Orders
If your tickets have sold but you cannot fulfill the order or there was a problem with fulfillment it is considered a “Busted Order.” TickPick reserves the right to designate, in its sole discretion, any action by Seller in violation of these Terms or the User Agreement a Busted Order, including but not limited to the following situations:
(a)
you cannot deliver the exact tickets or related passes in a timely manner;
(b)
you do not have a replacement ticket (tickets that TickPick determines in its sole discretion are comparable or better than the ones originally listed);
(c)
TickPick rejects any requested change to the original listing and cancels the order; or
(d)
or for any other reason you fail to complete your sale.
In the event a Busted Order occurs, TickPick may, at its sole discretion, charge the Seller an amount equal to or greater than 200% of the price of the tickets sold to compensate us for the expenses we incur to meet our obligations under the BuyerTrust Guarantee available
here
. TickPick reserves the right to suspend or terminate your TickPick Account in the event of a Busted Order.
3. Payments
Following your first sale on TickPick, you will receive an email to set up your account with our third-party payment provider . In order to set up an account and thus receive payments for your sales on TickPick, you are required to agree and adhere to any additional terms and conditions associated with the third-party payment provider.
Following TickPick’s receipt of money from the Buyer, TickPick, through its third-party payment provider, will remit to Seller the price of the ticket(s), less any fees, charges, set-off and other amounts due to TickPick in accordance with the terms herein. Sellers will usually be sent payments within fourteen (14) business days following the event. Payment receipt times will vary depending on the payment method chosen by the seller.
A TickPick Seller’s payout will be 5% less to cover the Credit Boost percentage given to the prospective buyer. They should expect their payment within the same timeframe as any other TickPick sale.
You agree and acknowledge the applicable Buyer (and not TickPick) is solely liable and responsible for payment for the tickets that you provide. You further agree and acknowledge that TickPick does not have any liability, responsibility, or obligation to make or remit any payment to you (as a Seller) for any provided tickets unless and to the extent TickPick has actually received payment of the Fees from the applicable Buyer for such tickets.
4. Communication with Buyers
TickPick may provide Sellers with certain information related to Buyers, such as their contact information, so that Sellers can send tickets to them. Sellers are prohibited from using such information for any purpose other than the fulfillment of their obligations in providing purchased tickets to Buyers. Sellers shall not include, in any communication to any Buyer, any content or information other than the purchased tickets. Other solicitations, contact information, or marketing or advertisements are prohibited. TickPick is not responsible for any use of such information provided by Seller.
5. General Seller Policies
As a Seller, you grant TickPick permission to charge the credit or debit card associated with your registered account for any and all charges, fees, liabilities, damages, and expenses incurred by TickPick if at any time the Seller fails to deliver the tickets they have listed or delivers invalid, fraudulent, counterfeit, incorrect, or misrepresented tickets.
There may be instances when TickPick requires tickets listed to be delivered to TickPick prior to sale. Upon the sale of the tickets, TickPick will deliver them to the Buyer on the Seller’s behalf. In the event the tickets are not sold, or the listing is removed, the tickets will be returned and accepted by the Seller.
TickPick does not guarantee that any tickets you list will sell, that you will make any particular amount of money in marketing and selling tickets on TickPick, or that any Buyers will complete any transaction with you or be able to pay for tickets. Furthermore, TickPick does not guarantee that any tickets will be listed in any particular way or with any preference or will appear within any particular period of time. TickPick reserves the right to restrict listing of tickets for sale and to remove listings of unsold tickets for any event.
If you have a dispute with one or more users (including Buyers or other Sellers), you release TickPick and all affiliated companies, officers, directors, agents, parents, subsidiaries, legal representatives, and employees from any claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.
The Seller agrees to indemnify and hold TickPick harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of Seller’s breach or alleged breach of these Supplemental Terms.
6. Event Cancellations and Postponement
TickPick will notify the Seller of any cancelled event. If you require your tickets to be returned to obtain a refund of the original purchase price, you must contact us at support@tickpick.com.
If an event is postponed, Sellers are prohibited from reselling, invalidating or changing tickets for postponed events.
7. Taxes
TickPick is not responsible in any way for the accuracy or suitability of any payment of any applicable taxes on your behalf, except as required by law. As a Seller, you are responsible for collecting and remitting any and all applicable international, federal, state, or municipal taxes in connection with ticket sales, except where we are required by law to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on those sales.
We issue tax forms at the conclusion of the calendar year to any Seller that meets the federal thresholds for documenting those sales per IRS requirements. You agree to provide TickPick with your Social Security Number or other tax identification number, if necessary, for TickPick to provide information to the relevant tax authorities related to payments you receive from us.

The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity

Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about

from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties

use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.

If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
