Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to the Sensor VPN app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Smart and Simple Intelligence LLC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

Data Security Commitment
Protecting our customers' data is our foremost concern. We only collect essential user data needed to provide and maintain our services. All terms used in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use. By accessing, installing, or using the Sensor VPN app, and by submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this Privacy Policy and enter a legal agreement with Smart and Simple Intelligence LLC, a Georgian company, referred to as Sensor VPN, “we,” or “us.” The data controller for your personal data is Smart and Simple Intelligence LLC (email: support@smartandsimpleintelligencellc.com). If you object to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sensor VPN app. For any inquiries regarding this policy or your privacy, contact us at support@smartandsimpleintelligencellc.com.
Data Processing Details
The Sensor VPN app limits data processing to what is strictly necessary for service provision, payment processing, and operating our website and mobile applications. Data processing is both automated and manual, and Sensor VPN or its subsidiaries will act as the personal data controller. We use third-party processors for payment processing, email services, marketing, and basic analytics. We adhere to a strict no-logs policy, ensuring that your activities through the Sensor VPN app are not monitored or recorded.
Information We Collect
Registration may be optional. If you choose to register, you'll need to provide your email address, which helps us communicate with you for service updates or troubleshooting. This email is also necessary for password recovery and establishing a VPN connection. For payment processing, our partners handle basic billing information. You are responsible for providing accurate, current, and complete information and have the authorization to do so. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts with inaccurate information. Technical data processed by Sensor VPN is minimal and may include server load information to recommend optimal servers.
Targeted Advertising
We may collaborate with third-party networks using cookies and pixel tags to collect data for personalized advertising. These ads may appear on our and third-party websites and apps. You can learn more about these practices and opt-out choices at the National Advertising Initiative's website. Note that opting out does not exempt you from seeing ads; they will just be less personalized. We are not responsible for third-party cookie use and recommend caution when sharing personal information on external platforms. Our advertising partner is Admob (Privacy Policy: Admob Privacy Policy).
Underage Users
Individuals under 18 should not use the Sensor VPN app or provide personal data without guardian supervision. We assume all users and data providers are at least 18. If we discover underage users, we will suspend their access immediately.
Data Processing Justification
We process your data to provide the best possible service, based on our contract outlined in the Terms of Service. We may use your email for direct marketing with your consent or as legally permitted. Data may be shared with third parties as specified in this policy.
Your Data Rights
You have the right to inquire about your data, request corrections, object to certain processing, receive a copy of your data, request data transfer, or deletion. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant laws. We do not log browsing history or traffic, making it difficult to link VPN IP addresses to individual users. In legal cases, we will provide the limited data we process. Withdraw consent or discontinue use at any time by contacting support@smartandsimpleintelligencellc.com.
Opt-Out and Data Retention
Unsubscribe from our communications anytime or control cookie use through your browser settings. We retain personal data as long as necessary, up to 2 years after the last app use. Contact us for a detailed list of your data. We respond within 30 days as per GDPR. We do not collect biometric data.

This Privacy Policy may be updated at our discretion. Users are encouraged to review the latest version regularly. Changes take effect upon publication.
