A SPECIAL NOTE TO OUR GUESTS CONCERNING PRIVACY
Effective Date: December 11, 2024
CCEC Entertainment Concepts, L.P., its parent company and its affiliates (collectively referred to herein as “CEC Entertainment”) are very respectful of the privacy concerns of the visitors to its sites on the internet. This privacy policy applies to any of the following operated by CEC Entertainment: chuckecheese.com, franchise.chuckecheese.com, pasquallyspizza.com,

, and mobile applications (the “Websites and Applications”).
Our websites and mobile applications are not for children and we have taken steps to ensure we have measures in place not to collect personal information from children. We engaged PRIVO to ensure we have privacy protections in place to prevent collection and meet the standards required under the Children’s online Privacy Protection Act. Further, we do not seek to acquire information specifically from children under the age of 13 on the Chuck E. Cheese Website or its mobile applications.
CEC Entertainment is a member of the PRIVO Kids Privacy Assured COPPA Safe Harbor Certification Program (“the Program”). The Program certification applies to the digital properties listed on the validation page that is viewable by clicking on the PRIVO Seal. PRIVO is an independent, third-party organization committed to safeguarding children’s personal information collected online. The PRIVO COPPA certification Seal posted on this page indicates CEC Entertainment has established COPPA compliant privacy practices and has agreed to submit to PRIVO’s oversight and consumer dispute resolution process.

Data Collection and Use
What Data We Process:
CEC Entertainment collects both required and optional data to enhance your experience. The required data includes your name, obscured email address (e.g., as used in certain social media logins), and phone number. Optionally, you can also provide your date of birth, invitation code, and details of up to six family members (name, DOB, relationship).
How We Process Your Data:
We use the data collected to personalize communications such as email messages, text messages, and promotional offers aimed at enhancing your experience with our services.
Purpose of Data Collection and Processing:
The primary purpose for collecting and processing your data is to improve guest satisfaction by offering tailored experiences and promotions that meet you and your family’s entertainment and dining preferences.
Data Deletion Requests:
Should you wish to cease using our services and have your data removed, you can delete your account at any time. This action will remove all your personal information from our active databases.
If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update, or request deletion of personally identifiable information collected by contacting us by emailing our Customer Support at
guestrelations@cecentertainment.com
or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. To safeguard your information, we will also take steps to verify your identity before granting access or correction. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. Although we do not seek to collect information from children, parents may, after providing proper parental identification, request to review, update, or delete their own child’s information that may have been submitted and refuse to allow CEC Entertainment to collect further information about their child by emailing our Customer Support at guestrelations@cecentertainment.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. Parents who provide information of their under 13 child can consent to collection and use of their child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Your request must include your first and last name, address, phone number and an email address.
If you have an account with us, you must provide the account information with your request.  We will compare the information you provide with your request with previous information provided by you to verify it is you making the request.  We may also contact you by telephone, text or email to complete this verification.
If you authorize an agent to make a request on your behalf, the agent must also provide documentation such as a power of attorney or other signed and notarized authorization from you to verify your agent’s right to request (and in the case of disclosure requests, right to receive information) on your behalf.  Any personal information we collect in connection with verifying your request will solely be used for that purpose.
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at:
