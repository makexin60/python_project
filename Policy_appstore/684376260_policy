What’s included with the 5% off benefit?
Pros get 5% extra off:
All digital games & currencies online.
All pre-owned products. This includes video games, consoles, video game accessories, and tech.
All collectibles (including graded collectibles), trading cards, toys, and apparel.
All clearance.
All GameStop brand products. This includes GameStop, Atrix, Candy Con, Geeknet, and Modern Icons (excluding gift cards).

How do I get free shipping?
Pros are eligible for free shipping when spending $54+ in one order. To qualify, the threshold is based on the subtotal after discounts have been applied but before taxes.
The order subtotal excludes pre-orders, graded collectibles, same day delivery, digital downloads, product protection plans, and Buy Online Pickup In-Store.
Free shipping is subject to change at any time and in GameStop’s sole discretion, and other exclusions may apply.
Can I renew my Pro Membership early?
Yes, you can renew your Membership up to 6 months before the expiration date, in-store.
How do points work?
Pros earn 20 points per $1 spent, excluding GameStop gift cards, taxes/fees, and other non-eligible purchases. Make sure you are signed into your account when making online purchases on GameStop.com.
Visit the Rewards Center within the My Account section online to redeem points for coupons you can use in-store or online. You can also talk to a store associate about redeeming points at checkout when at a GameStop store.
You can redeem points for many things, including redeeming as little as 1,000 points for a $1 Reward Certificate. You can even redeem your points in-store towards another year of Pro membership!
Points will be posted to a Member’s account within approximately 24-48 hours from the time of purchase. Ad hoc promotional points may take up to two weeks to post.
Do my points expire? What is the point expiration policy?
Points expire 13 months from the date of accumulation.
If your Pro membership ends, all of your points will expire 45 days after the end date.
Pro Tip: Keep your Account on auto-renew and redeem your points within a year of accumulating them to prevent your points from expiring!
If I joined Pro at a GameStop store, how do I activate my account online?
Visit
https://www.gamestop.com/create-account/
and select “Activate Membership” to set up your account profile.
What is the $5 Monthly Reward for Pros and how does it work?
This is a coupon that active Pros receive in their account during the first week of each month. The discount will automatically apply to the most expensive eligible item in your order. This coupon can be used in-store or online to get $5 off one eligible item.
Eligible items include most physical games (new and pre-owned), accessories, collectibles, hardware, and almost everything else GameStop sells.
These coupons cannot stack with most other promotions and exclusions apply.
The coupon cannot be used on gift cards, taxes/fees, downloadable content, digital gaming/virtual currencies, digital game downloads, a Pro Membership, or reservations.
To use in-store, present your Pro membership information (such as your phone number) to the store associate and they can apply it for you, or you can present the code found in your GameStop Pro account.
To use online, simply have an eligible item in your cart and hit the “Apply” button next to the coupon on the cart page.
The coupon expires during the last day of that calendar month. Pros will not receive a monthly reward certificate for the calendar month they enroll.
GameStop Pro Membership Autorenewal
What is GameStop Pro Membership Auto-Renewal and how do I manage/refund it?
Auto-Renewal allows Pro Members to have a credit/debit card on file for annual billing of GameStop Pro. It’s a convenient way to add another year of Pro Membership instead of benefits expiring and renewing manually! Plus, you’ll get a $5 Renewal Reward (5,000 points) when your membership successfully auto-renews.
You can easily manage GameStop Pro Auto-Renewal or request a refund within 45 days of Auto-Renewing by calling GameStop Customer Service at 1-800-883-8895 or by email at

GameStop Pro Terms & Conditions
and the

You can easily manage GameStop Pro Auto-Renewal at
https://www.gamestop.com/pro/membership/
or by calling GameStop Customer Service at 1-800-883-8895.

You can request a refund within 45 days of Auto-Renewing by calling GameStop Customer Service at 1-800-883-8895 or by email at
care@gamestop.com

Get Cash or Credit
Do I get cash or credit for my previously loved (used) items?
Most of our stores offer the option of choosing between cash or in-store credit for select items. Keep in mind that the credit value on your trade-in items is usually higher than cash value but in our stores where both options are offered, it’s your choice.
Check here
to find your nearest store and see what trade-in options they offer.
What can I sell for cash or credit?
We’re now accepting more items than ever, including iPhones, smartphones, consoles, video games, video game accessories, smartwatches, tablets, headphones, and more. Some of the items and brands with the highest value include Apple, Samsung, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, just to name a few.
How do I sell my stuff at GameStop?
Simply bring your items to the nearest participating store and a Store Associate/Manager will evaluate them. Remember to erase all your personal information off your product before you bring it in. Be sure to bring in any chargers, cables, controllers, or other hardware that originally came with your product. Also, it’s helpful if you have your product fully charged so it can be tested more quickly.
You can get a preview of the value of your item by visiting our
cash or credit purchase page.
How much do I get?
That depends on the item. Consoles, iPhones, and certain tech devices like iPads, not to mention the hottest new games, fetch more than older items and games. But even most older things have some value. The condition of your item will also play a role in how much cash or credit it’s worth.
The better the condition, the higher the value. Products that are fully operational and cosmetically unblemished will receive the maximum amount for that specific product.
Some damaged items may still be accepted. Things like iPhones with cracked screens or water damage may be taken. Whether damaged items are eligible, and the value received for them, will be determined at the Manager’s discretion.
