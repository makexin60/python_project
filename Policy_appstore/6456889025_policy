Most commonly, we will use your personal data where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests, or where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
How We Share Your Information
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the paragraph above ("How We Use Your Information"):
Internal Third Parties: Other companies in the Dviz Limited group acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the EU provide IT and system administration services and undertake leadership reporting.
External Third Parties Service: Service providers (vendors) acting as processors based in and outside of the EU who provide IT and system administration services, financial transaction processing services, customer service, marketing efforts, and other business operations.
Specific Vendors: We may share your personal data with specific vendors that we partner with to provide certain services, such as money on and off-ramp services.
Potential Business Partners or Buyers: We may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets with other businesses. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
How We Protect Your Information
The security of your personal data is of utmost importance to us. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Our security measures include encryption of your data, security assessments of all service providers who may handle your personal data, regular planning to ensure we are ready to respond to cyber security attacks and data security incidents, and regular testing of our technology and ways of working, including disaster recovery and incident response drills.
International Transfers
ScopeX operates on a global scale which means it may be necessary to transfer your personal data internationally. In particular, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commissionâ€™s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal data they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
Your Legal Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:
Request access to your personal data: This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of your personal data: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Object to processing of your personal data: This is in situations where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing your personal data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request transfer of your personal data: We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Right to withdraw consent: If we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please

Marketing Preferences
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
