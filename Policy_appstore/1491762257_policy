COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKERS
What is a tracker?
A tracker is data used by a server to send information to the internet user’s browser, and used by the browser to send information back to the original server. This information can be a session identifier, a language, etc. Trackers allow data to be collected from the most visited pages of a website, to make it easier to use the website by saving the internet user’s choice of language, etc.
A cookie is a type of tracker that is stored on the internet user’s device (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when he or she vists a website.
Session cookies disappear when the internet user closes the browser or leaves the website, whilst permanent cookies are stored on the internet user’s device until their expiration date (up to six months maximum from the moment they are first stored on the device for cookies requiring your consent, and thirteen months for the other cookies), or until the internet user deletes them.
What types of trackers are used when you visit this website?
When you visit this website, different types of trackers are used.
Some do not require your consent. These cookies are essential for making it easier to browse the website, allowing us to save the information you saw displayed in a central window requesting you to accept the use of cookies and consent to the insallation of trackers on your device, to manage and secure your authentication on our website, to access certain online services, such as shopping basket validation, to measure certain aspects of website performance in order to detect browsing problems, or to save your setting preferences.
Other cookies require your consent. These are:
- Functionality cookies for:
- Adapting the website to your device’s display preferences (language, currency, display resolution, operating system used, display configuration and settings of website pages in accordance with the device you are using and its location etc.)
- Memorising certain information that you enter on the website to make it easier to personalise subsequent browsing (e.g. displaying your first and last names when you have a user account and you have signed in);
- Audience and performance monitoring cookies, helping the STVI to understand your interaction with the website (most visited pages, journey, content views, applications used etc.) and process information collected on third-party websites. They enable us to produce statistics and improve relevance and ergonomics.
- Advertising cookies for:
o Providing you with targeted content that may be of interest to you (e.g: best offers, other destinations,) based on your interests, browsing habits and preferences; and particularly to provide you with offers on STVI products and services that are adapted to suit your needs;
o Limiting the number of adverts displayed.
In the event that you do not give your consent, the advertising will still appear, but it will not be adapted to your interests.
- Affiliation cookies for identifying the original third-party website that redirected you to this website;
- Connection cookies, allowing the STVI to access your information found on third party accounts, should you wish to log in quickly through your other accounts (e.g.: Facebook, Google, Apple);
- Social media network cookies, to allow you the possibility to access the STVI’s pages, or to share/like information on this website, and to allow the relevant social networks to follow your browsing on this website, or to take you to the STVI’s social media network pages. As the STVI does not control the way the data collected by these social networks is used, we would encourage you to read their confidentiality policies.
How do you accept, refuse or delete these trackers?
When you first visit this website, then once every six months, you are asked to accept the collection and use of cookies. For this purpose, a central window displays on this website, requesting you to accept the collection of cookies and set your preferences (if you wish to modify them or refuse all or some of these cookies).
We would inform you that refusal may compromise your experience of our website. The STVI therefore declines all responsibility for any consequences of such a refusal, including the absence of any offering of content suited to your browsing habits or preferences.
Nevertheless, whatever you decide, you may do the following at any time:
- Change your settings in our cookie management tool, exclusively for cookies collected via this website;
- Delete trackers from your device via your browser, these preferences applying to all of your online browsing.
Most browsers are set to accept the use of all cookies and trackers by default. You may change the settings in order to select tracers that you agree to use, or refuse trackers. You need to configure the settings on each of your devices (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.).
Important: if your browser is configured to refuse all or some trackers, certain functionalities, pages or sections of this website may not be accessible to you, or offer the best browsing conditions.
Setting and deleting trackers varies between browsers. The procedure is described in your browser help menu. These are the tracker setting procedures for the most common browsers:
- Internet Explorer: Cookie management on Internet Explorer; - Safari: Cookie management on Safari; - Chrome: Cookie management on Chrome; - Firefox: Cookie management on Firefox.
We would remind you that if you decide to clear all cookies from your device via your browser, the STVI will no longer hold information about your setting preferences and will have to ask you to set your preferences again the next time you visit our website. This also applies when you use a new browser or device. The settings are managed at the sole responsibility of the browsers, and the STVI cannot guarantee that they will function properly.
Browser settings are sometime inadequate. You can refine your settings further if you wish, by targeting the aim of each cookie:
- For audience measuring and performance: To find out more about the system for refusing the Google Analytics (and other Google products) audience monitoring trackers, click here;
- For advertising: This website does not display any advertising. Consequently, the information collected serves primarily to offer you targeted advertising on third-party sites that you visit, based on information collected through audience measuring trackers. Several professional advertising platforms give you the chance to refuse or accept cookies used by their member businesses. Whilst these centralised networks do not block the display of advertising, they stop the cookies that can adapt the advertising to your centres of interest, from being installed onto your device. You can go to the website, Your Online Choices, to forbid the installation of these cookies on your device. This site is run by professional digital advertisers who have come together as the European Digital Advertising Alliance, which is operated in France by the Interactive Advertising Bureau France. The STVI does not guarantee the efficiency or smooth running of this tool, which is reliant on the system’s advertisers;
- For social media networks: On this website you will find sharing buttons that redirect you to the STVI’s social media pages. If you have an account with one of these social media networks, they may also be able to follow your browsing of our website. To find out more about how these networks use trackers, ad how to configure your account, please click on the following links: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram.
The STVI may also offer connection services through social media networks or certain web interfaces (e.g.: Facebook Connect, Google Connect, Apple Connect..) to make it easier for you to log in and make purchases. If you are already a user of these services, this functionality allows you to log in without having to provide your personal details, authorising the STVI to access this information.
Finally, we would like to inform you that a number of different programmes are available to add to your browser to enable you to block and manage all types of tracker, including Abine and Ghostery.
For further information about cookie management and collection, you can also visit the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL) website.

- Change your settings in our cookie management tool, exclusively for cookies collected via this website;
- Delete trackers from your device via your browser, these preferences applying to all of your online browsing.
Most browsers are set to accept the use of all cookies and trackers by default. You may change the settings in order to select tracers that you agree to use, or refuse trackers. You need to configure the settings on each of your devices (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.).
Important: if your browser is configured to refuse all or some trackers, certain functionalities, pages or sections of this website may not be accessible to you, or offer the best browsing conditions.
Setting and deleting trackers varies between browsers. The procedure is described in your browser help menu. These are the tracker setting procedures for the most common browsers:
- Internet Explorer: Cookie management on Internet Explorer; - Safari: Cookie management on Safari; - Chrome: Cookie management on Chrome; - Firefox: Cookie management on Firefox.
We would remind you that if you decide to clear all cookies from your device via your browser, the STVI will no longer hold information about your setting preferences and will have to ask you to set your preferences again the next time you visit our website. This also applies when you use a new browser or device. The settings are managed at the sole responsibility of the browsers, and the STVI cannot guarantee that they will function properly.
Browser settings are sometime inadequate. You can refine your settings further if you wish, by targeting the aim of each cookie:
- For audience measuring and performance: To find out more about the system for refusing the Google Analytics (and other Google products) audience monitoring trackers, click here;
- For advertising: This website does not display any advertising. Consequently, the information collected serves primarily to offer you targeted advertising on third-party sites that you visit, based on information collected through audience measuring trackers. Several professional advertising platforms give you the chance to refuse or accept cookies used by their member businesses. Whilst these centralised networks do not block the display of advertising, they stop the cookies that can adapt the advertising to your centres of interest, from being installed onto your device. You can go to the website, Your Online Choices, to forbid the installation of these cookies on your device. This site is run by professional digital advertisers who have come together as the European Digital Advertising Alliance, which is operated in France by the Interactive Advertising Bureau France. The STVI does not guarantee the efficiency or smooth running of this tool, which is reliant on the system’s advertisers;
- For social media networks: On this website you will find sharing buttons that redirect you to the STVI’s social media pages. If you have an account with one of these social media networks, they may also be able to follow your browsing of our website. To find out more about how these networks use trackers, ad how to configure your account, please click on the following links: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram.
The STVI may also offer connection services through social media networks or certain web interfaces (e.g.: Facebook Connect, Google Connect, Apple Connect..) to make it easier for you to log in and make purchases. If you are already a user of these services, this functionality allows you to log in without having to provide your personal details, authorising the STVI to access this information.
Finally, we would like to inform you that a number of different programmes are available to add to your browser to enable you to block and manage all types of tracker, including Abine and Ghostery.
