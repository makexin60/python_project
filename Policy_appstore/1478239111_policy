If you reside within the EEA and have concerns, objections, or questions regarding our personal data processing policy, contact us at gdpr@rouvy.com. We will do utmost to handle your inquiry.

You may revoke your consent.

processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose personal data require protection.
You have the right to revoke your consent to personal data processing at any time.
Protection of Personal Data of Children
If you are a parent or the legal guardian of a child and you want to open a ROUVY account for your child, read carefully this section of the personal data processing policy.
If you believe that a child, aged below 13 years (USA) or 16 years (EEA) or below the age at which the law of the state where the child resides restricts independent juridical acts in relation to services corresponding to services provided by the ROUVY application has provided personal data without parental consent, contact us at gdpr@rouvy.com. We will make maximum effort to remove such personal data from our files as soon as possible.
In opening an account for your child, we will ask you to create a user name for your child (choose a name unrelated to your child’s real name) and to provide your child's personal data, such as his/her email address that will serve for sign-in purposes. In addition, we will require your name, surname, relationship to the child (parent or legal guardian), and e-mail address. Kindly note that the e-mail address provided for the purpose of signing in to your child's account must not be associated with an existing ROUVY membership. You or your child will be asked about your child's sex, height, and weight to allow us to calculate training data accurately. In addition, we will collect all information provided by you or by your child for the purposes of adapting your child's profile.
When ROUVY services are used by your child, we collect training data, including the route, pedalling frequency, effort, trip length, overall performance, total calories burned, elevation, and heart rate, provided that your child uses a heart rate sensor. In addition, we collect information on all screenshots taken by your child, completed challenges and missions, your child's experience level, and test results.

No data relating to ROUVY child accounts are shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties with the exception of the following situations:
we provide personal data to service providers for data processing based on our instructions, subject to compliance with relevant appropriate measures ensuring confidentiality and security,
if we take part in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue adopting measures protecting the confidentiality of personal data, and you will be notified before personal data are handed over to the successor company; likewise, we will ensure that your child's personal data remain protected by the legal successor in a situation resulting from any of the abovementioned transactions.
We have the right to disclose your child's personal data if required to comply with laws, regulations, legal procedures, requests made by government authorities, to exercise our legal rights, to defend ourselves against legal claims, and to protect ourselves from unlawful acts.
Being the parent or legal guardian, you have control over your child’s account and you have access to the account. That includes the right to make changes concerning the account.
