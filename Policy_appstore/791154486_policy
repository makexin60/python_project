Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 20th, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how Goxal Studios ('we,' 'our,' or 'us') handles information when you use our mobile applications. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.
Analytics and Data Collection
We use third-party analytics services to understand how our apps are used and to improve our services. These analytics providers may collect and process the following information:
• Device information (model, operating system version)
• App usage statistics and performance data
• General location data (country level only)
This data is processed according to the privacy policies of our analytics providers. We do not collect or store any personal information directly.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in understanding how our apps are used and improving our services.
You can opt out of analytics data collection through your device settings.
Advertising
Our apps display advertisements to keep them free. These ads are served through platform-specific advertising networks (Apple App Store and Google Play Store) that operate independently of our apps.
The advertising platforms may use device-level information to show relevant ads. This process is governed by their respective privacy policies and your device's advertising settings.
The legal basis for advertising is our legitimate interest in monetizing our free apps.
You can control ad personalization through your device settings. While you can opt out of personalized ads, our apps will still display non-personalized ads.

International Data Processing
Our third-party service providers may process data outside your country of residence. These transfers are governed by their respective privacy policies and appropriate safeguards.
By using our apps, you consent to this international data processing.
Data Security
We do not collect or store personal information directly. Any data collected through third-party services (analytics and advertising) is processed according to their respective privacy policies and security measures.
We regularly review our practices to ensure they align with industry standards and regulations.
While we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
Children's Privacy
Our apps are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or higher if required by your country). We do not knowingly collect any information from children.
If you believe we may have inadvertently collected information from a child under the applicable age, please contact us, and we will promptly take steps to delete such information.
Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be reflected by updating the 'Last Updated' date at the top of this page.
We will notify you of any material changes through our apps or other means.
By continuing to use our apps after changes are made, you accept and agree to the updated Privacy Policy.
