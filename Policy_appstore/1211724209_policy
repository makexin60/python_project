1. Introduction
At DLA Piper, we take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality and we undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us.
This privacy notice ("Notice") sets out the basis on which DLA Piper processes the personal data it collects from you. For the purposes of this Notice, DLA Piper means DLA Piper International LLP and the various DLA Piper entities operating in the UK, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, also referred to in this notice as "the firm" or "we".
2. Scope of Privacy Notice
Like most businesses, we hold and process a wide range of information, some of which relates to individuals who are applying to work for us. This Notice explains the type of information we process, why we are processing it and how that processing may affect you.
The Notice focuses on individuals who are applying to work for us as an employee, partner, contingent worker, a contractor, a consultant or work experience and the data that we process as part of that process. We have a separate Internal Privacy Notice that applies to our current and former employees.
References in this Notice to employment, work (and similar expressions) include any arrangement we may have under which an individual provides us with work or services, or applies for such work or services, including but not limited to partners of any DLA Piper entity.
We use the word “you” to refer to anyone within the scope of the Notice.
In brief, this Notice explains:
what personal data we hold and why we process it;
the legal grounds which allow us to process your personal data;
where the data comes from, who gets to see it and how long we keep it;
how to access your personal data and other rights;
how to contact us.
3. Types of personal data processed
"Personal data" is a concept defined by data protection law, and refers to any information which relates to an identified or identifiable individual. It includes not only facts about an individual, but also intentions and opinions about them.
"Processing" means doing anything with the data. For example, it includes collecting it, holding it, disclosing it and deleting it.
"Sensitive personal data" or "special categories of data" is data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, sex life, trade union membership and genetic and biometric data and is subject to special protection under relevant data protection law.
The types of personal data which we process will vary depending on your role, your location and the terms and conditions of employment or engagement (if any) relevant to you. DLA Piper generally process data for the purposes of our business including providing services to our clients, management, administrative, employment and for legal and regulatory purposes.
4. Sources of personal data
When you apply to work for us the initial data about you that we process is likely to come from you: for example, contact details and information on your immigration status and whether you can lawfully work. Where necessary and in accordance with this Notice, we will require references and information to carry out background checks. If you have concerns about this in a particular context, you should speak to your contact within our Recruitment team.
Please note we may also receive data from third party recruiters, agents and similar organisations as a part of the recruitment process, or as a referral from one of our employees or clients.
5. Disclosures of personal data
5.1 Internal use
Your personal data will be seen internally by members of the Recruitment team, and other HR team members, recruiting managers, and in some circumstances (if you join us) colleagues. We will also disclose this to other members of the firm where necessary for decision making regarding your application, this will depend on the type of role you are applying for.
5.2 External use
We will only disclose your personal data outside the firm if disclosure is consistent with a ground for processing on which we rely and doing so is lawful and fair to you.
We will disclose your data if it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the interests of a third party (but we will not do this if these interests are over-ridden by your interests and rights in particular to privacy).
Where necessary, we will also disclose your personal data if you consent, or where we are required to do so by law and in connection with criminal or regulatory investigations. Please note that when we disclose your data in such circumstances, where applicable, we will ensure that any necessary due diligence has been undertaken on the recipient and any necessary contractual documentation is in place to ensure the integrity and security of the data as required by law.
Specific circumstances in which your personal data may be disclosed include:
Disclosure to third party providers to carry out reference checks, credit checks and other pre-employment on-boarding activities if you accept an offer from us;
Disclosure to organisations that process data on our behalf such as our payroll service, insurers and other benefit providers, our bank and organisations that host our IT systems and data. This would normally occur if you accept an offer from us and would be carried out as part of the on-boarding process;
Disclosure to any regulator as necessary as part of the recruitment process.
In some jurisdictions, we also use a third party ATS (applicant tracking system) which stores your personal data for us once you have made an application in order to enable the relevant Recruiting manager and Recruiter to consider your application.
6. Retention of data
Our general approach is to only retain your personal data for as long as is required to satisfy the purpose for which it was collected by us or provided by you. If you become employed by us we will keep your personal data for the duration of your employment and for a period afterwards.
If you are unsuccessful in gaining employment with us, we will keep your personal data for a short period after informing you that you were unsuccessful and in any event, normally, for no longer than 12 months or a shorter period where legally required, from your last contact with us. Your data may be kept on file and considered for other roles.
7. Cross border transfers
The global nature of our business means that your personal data may be disclosed to other DLA Piper entities, or to third party suppliers or partners, located outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including (but not limited to) our entities in Africa, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and the United States of America which do not offer a level of protection of privacy equivalent to the level within the European Union.
In respect of internal transfers within DLA Piper, we have entered into an intra-group agreement, using the Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure your data receives an adequate level of protection.
In respect of transfers of your personal data to third party suppliers outside of the EEA, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection, including by, for example, entering into data transfer agreements or by ensuring that third parties are certified under appropriate data protection schemes.
8. Data Subject Rights
You have a variety of rights to exercise control over your personal data, including rights of access, erasure and objection. These rights are subject to certain exemptions which we may need to apply, and certain rights (such as erasure) only apply in limited circumstances. Further information on this and on other rights is in Schedule 2 Data Subject Rights, to this Notice.
9. Children under 16
If you are aged 16 or under‚ we require your parent/guardian's permission before you provide us with your personal information.
10. Automatic decision making
We may use automatic decision making within our processes in order to appropriately progress applications you make to us. Any automatic decisions made will be on the basis of online assessment results only and not on the basis of personal information.
You may contact us to find out more information about automatic decision making including speaking with us about your application by emailing recruitment@dlapiper.com or by writing to Recruitment Team - Data Privacy, 160 Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HT, United Kingdom, or by telephone +44 (0) 8700 111 111.

This only applies if the ground for processing is Consent or Contract.
If we have relied on consent as a ground for processing, you may withdraw consent at any time – though if you do so that will not affect the lawfulness of what we have done before you withdraw consent.
