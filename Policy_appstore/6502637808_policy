This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and share information—including facial data—when you use our face-swapping features. By using Face Swap App, you agree to the terms of this policy.
1. Information We Collect
1.
Facial Data
•We collect certain facial data when you choose to use our face-swapping functionality. Facial data generally includes unique measurements or a representation of a user’s facial characteristics derived from uploaded images or video content.
•
Note:
We do not collect or store biometric identifiers (such as face scans for the purpose of determining identity) beyond what is strictly necessary to perform face-swapping features, as described below.
2.
Other Data
•We may also collect non-face-related data, such as device information (e.g., operating system, device type), usage analytics (e.g., frequency of app use, crash logs), and any personal information you provide when you contact us.
2. Why We Collect and Store Face Data
We collect and process your facial data for the
sole purpose
of providing and improving our face-swapping features. Specifically, we use facial data to:
1.
Identify Facial Landmarks
Our algorithms detect facial landmarks to enable the swap and produce a convincing final image.
2.
Enhance User Experience
Storing certain facial data temporarily allows us to optimize the quality of face swaps, troubleshoot technical issues, and improve the performance of our services.
3.
Quality Assurance
We may use aggregated or anonymized data to refine our face detection and swapping technology. This helps us ensure consistent, high-quality results for all users.
3. How Long We Store Face Data
1.
Retention Period
We store facial data
only for as long as necessary
to provide and improve the face-swapping feature. Typically, facial data is retained temporarily
(e.g., for X days)
so that you can revisit or modify the face swap, and so we can continuously improve accuracy.
2.
Reason for This Duration
•
Technical Optimization:
Temporary storage allows you to edit your face swaps or undo them if needed.
•
Continued Improvement:
Short-term retention enables us to enhance our technology based on aggregate trends and feedback.
3.
No Indefinite Storage
We do
not
store facial data indefinitely. All face data is either deleted or anonymized once it is no longer needed for its original purpose.

Feature Improvement

only on our behalf
and under strict contractual obligations to protect your privacy.
