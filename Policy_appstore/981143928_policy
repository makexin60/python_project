Privacy Policy

Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
for Apple or
shazam.com/privacy
for Shazam.
To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or by calling 1-800-275-2273.

At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to
collect only the personal data that we need
. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
When you create an Apple Account, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:

Device Information.
Data from which your device could be identified, such as device serial number, or about your device, such as browser type

Location Information
. Precise location only to support services such as Find My or where you agree for region-specific services, and coarse location
Health Information.
Data relating to the health status of an individual, including data related to one’s physical or mental health or condition. Personal health data also includes data that can be used to make inferences about or detect the health status of an individual. If you participate in a study using an Apple Health Research Study app, the policy governing the privacy of your personal data is described in the
Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
.
Fitness Information.
Details relating to your fitness and exercise information where you choose to share them
Financial Information.
Details including salary, income, and assets information where collected, and information related to Apple-branded financial offerings
Government ID Data.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government-issued ID in limited circumstances, including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law
Other Information You Provide to Us.
Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels
You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.
Apple may receive personal data about you from other
individuals
, from businesses or third parties acting
at your direction
, from our
partners
who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other
lawful sources.
Individuals.
Apple may collect data about you from other individuals — for example, if that individual has sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.
At Your Direction.
You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases.
Apple Partners.
We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the
Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form
. For more information about Applebot, visit
support.apple.com/120320
.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Power Our Services.
Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.
Process Your Transactions.
To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it’s also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
child’s educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
“cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

Apple products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible,
your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world,
including Apple-affiliated companies, to perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live.
For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. and other Apple-affiliated companies on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For example, Imagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps and to support our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc. in California.
Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Apple’s international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by
Standard Contractual Clauses
. If you have questions or would like a copy of Apple’s Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Personal data collected by
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures.
Apple’s privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit

Personal data relating to individuals in the People’s Republic of China may be processed by Apple in countries outside of the People’s Republic of China, such as Apple Inc. in the United States or Apple Distribution International Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law. For the purposes of processing set out in this Privacy Policy, Apple may also transfer such personal data to third-party service providers, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of the People’s Republic of China.

apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or call the
Apple Support number
for your country or region.
You can also ask us questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to help.
Apple takes your privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best to respond to your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or download request. In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other cases, we may require additional information or let you know that we need more time to respond.
Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.
You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with Apple’s response — refer your complaint to the applicable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.
When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

If you have an active, duly executed contract for Quantcast services (“
Existing Contract
”), the Existing Contract will govern your use of the service(s) covered in the Existing Contract instead of these Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (“
Terms
”). In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the “
Service
” as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service.
Quantcast Measure Terms of Service
This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this
“Agreement”
)
describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the
“Services”
)
available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
This Agreement incorporates the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the
Privacy Implementation for
Quantcast Publisher Partners
.
1. Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call,
“
Reachpoints
”)
for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call,
“
Measurement Data
”
). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the
“
Measurement Results
”,
which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“Authorized Affiliate”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
2. Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions
provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
3. Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
4. Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual’s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web
pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and
(iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe.

In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the
“
Ad Preference Setting
”
). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement.
Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws.

7. Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.

12. Miscellaneous.

Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision.

Quantcast Measure Terms of Service
This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this
“Agreement”
)
describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the
“Services”
)
available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
This Agreement incorporates the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the
Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners
.
1.     Introducti
on: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call,
“
Reachpoints
”)
for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call,
“
Measurement Data
”
). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the
“
Measurement Results
”,
which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“Authorized Affiliate”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
2.     Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
3.     Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
4.     Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual’s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the
“
Ad Preference Setting
”
). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
5.     Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:

Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
6.     Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (
“
Quantcast Property
”
). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
7.     Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense.

If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.

IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
This Agreement incorporates the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the
Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners
.
Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call,
“
Reachpoints
”)
for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call,
“
Measurement Data
”
). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the
“
Measurement Results
”,
which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“Authorized Affiliate”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the
“
Ad Preference Setting
”
). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (
“
Quantcast Property
”
). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing contact@quantcast.com (if you are resident in the US) or contact.dublin@quantcast.com (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.
This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.
This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, “
Reachpoints
”) for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, “
Measurement Data
”). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the “
Measurement Results
”, which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3). For more information about how the Services work, please see our
FAQ
.
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“
Authorized Affiliate
”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
Registration.

Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites.

To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users in the EU, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(such as
Quantcast Choice
) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the “
Ad Preference Setting

Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied.

Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing
contact@quantcast.com
(if you are resident in the US) or
contact.dublin@quantcast.com
(if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).
Miscellaneous.
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast.

“Agreement”
) describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure and Q for Publishers (the
“Services”
) available to you.
BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.
Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.
Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, “
Reachpoints
”) for direct measurement.
You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.
Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, “
Measurement Data
”). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the “
Measurement Results
”, which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3). For more information about how the Services work, please see our
FAQ
.
To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an
“
Authorized Affiliate
”
); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.
Registration.
In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Data when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Privacy Policy which you can access
here
.
You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.
Measurement Data and Results.
Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.
Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.
Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:
Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast
www.quantcast.com
”;
Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
Tagging Rules and Privacy.
You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a
Quantcast Learning Center Guide
. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.
You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users in the EU, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the
IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
(such as
Quantcast Choice
) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.
You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.
In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the “
Ad Preference Setting
”). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.
To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of processing of any Personal Data disclosed or received under this Agreement.
To the extent that CCPA applies, Quantcast is a Third Party in its relationship with you regarding your use of the Services.
If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.
Restrictions.
You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Service to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:
Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.
Quantcast Rights.
All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (“
Quantcast Property
”). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.
Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.
Indemnity.
Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement.
The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.
You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.
Warranty Disclaimer.
The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.
Suspension and Termination.
Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing
contact@quantcast.com
(if you are resident in the US) or
contact.dublin@quantcast.com
(if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.
Modification of the Service and of the Terms.
Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.
Limitation of Liability.
In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.
Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more
Pseudonymous Identifier
s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Email Address
See Hashed Email Address
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
Hashed Email Address
A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes
Device Information
.
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.
Read more about the TCF here
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Email Address
See Hashed Email Address
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online

Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
Hashed Email Address
A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.
Read more about the TCF here
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address
.

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics.  Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
.  An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and Inferred Data to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
on behalf of the Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store  a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device  or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives Bid Requests from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of Personal Information, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided  to a user; (B) whether  or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s Processing and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s Processing and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.
Read more about the TCF here
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you.  For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel.  Other Inferences  include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with Pseudonymous Identifiers to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and Inferences/Inferred Data.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as Pseudonymous Identifiers,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or Inferences/Inferred Data, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as Personal Information. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to Pseudonymised Identifiers. Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a Pseudonymous Identifier which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as IP Addresses) with Bid Request Data and/or Event Data using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using Cookie IDs, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon Personal Information or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by Clients or Third Party Data Partners. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
, Inferences, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a Label (in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers,  where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used  for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These Inferences are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics.  Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
.  An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
on behalf of the Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store  a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device  or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided  to a user; (B) whether  or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.
Read more about the TCF here
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you.  For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel.  Other Inferences  include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data
).
Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Third party identifiers
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.
For detailed descriptions of TCF “Purpose” or TCF “Special Purpose”, see

Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers,  where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used  for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address
.

Attributes/Attribute Information
Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from
Event Data
, Bid Request Data,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
. Quantcast associates attributes with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
.
Audience
An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an
Interest
, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an
Attribute
, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.
Audience Insights
Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an
Audience
. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not
Personal Information
. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.
Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferred Data
to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.
Bid Request/Bid Request Data
A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an
Advertising Exchange
. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (
https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/
), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a
Pseudonymous Identifier
(if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as
TCF Signals
. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.
Browsing Data
Browsing Data is information collected relating to your
Online
activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a
Pixels, Tags, or SDKs
installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website
URL
of the page you are visiting, often along with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from
HTTP Header Information
, such as referral
URLs
(which is the
URL
that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).
Browsing Data is included in
Event Data
.
Client Data
Client Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is
Pseudonymised Information,
which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’
Online Data
or
Offline Data
, or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right
Audiences
on behalf of the Client.
Cookie
A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are
Pseudonymous Information
; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a
Pseudonymous Identifier
to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
or
Pseudonymous Information
from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.
There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.
A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“
First Party Cookie
”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If
www.example.com
incorporates Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that
Pseudonymous Identifier
in the context of your visits to that site.
A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting
www.example.com
and a Quantcast
Pixel, Tag or SDK
on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
. Quantcast uses
Pseudonymous Identifiers
stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.
Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.
Cookie ID/Identifier
A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a
Cookie
that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are
Pseudonymous Identifiers
. A
First Party Cookie
ID is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
First-Party Cookie
set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A
Third Party Cookie ID
is a unique
Pseudonymous Identifier
relating to the
Third-Party Cookie
set by Quantcast.
Cookie Syncing/Matching
In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own
Pseudonymous Identifier
can determine which of their respective
Pseudonymous Identifiers
may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective
Pseudonymous identifiers
may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.
Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing
Attributes
related to Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched
Pseudonymous Identifier.
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or
Inferred
to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.
If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide
Third Party Data
to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide
Client Data
to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party
Audience
Segment Data
from different sources (such as
Online Data
and
Offline Data
) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share
Pseudonymous Identifiers
with
Data Management Platforms/Data Providers
in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see
Cookie Syncing/Matching
).
Device ID/Identifier
A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “
Device IDs
”) serve a similar purpose as
Cookies
and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
A Mobile Advertising ID (or “
MAID
”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device by the mobile device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.
Device Configuration/Device Information
Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a
User Agent.
Some Device Information is derived from
HTTP Request Header Information
.
Event Data
Information collected relating to your
Online
activity/behaviour, which may include
Personal Information
in
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
,
HTTP Request Header Information
,
Device Information
,
Browsing Data
and
TCF Signals
. Event Data is generated when a
Pixel, Tag, or SDK
installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a
Tag
.
Exchange/Advertising Exchange
A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives
Bid Requests
from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to
Bid Requests
with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.
First Party Cookie
See
Cookie
.
HTTP Request Header Information
HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a
Pixel
loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a
Bid Request
. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:
IP Address
Cookie
(if available)
User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
Date, which includes the precise time of access
Referral
URL
, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data
Processing
by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that
Processing
.
The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.
The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:
(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
, the specific purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
, and Quantcast's legal basis for such
Processing
, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;
(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of
Cookies
, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's
Processing
, which are the reasons why Quantcast
Processes
the personal data of users (“
TCF Purposes”
), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such
Processing
directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;
(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's
Processing
of
Personal Information
(for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.
Using the
TCF
allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s
Processing
to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the
TCF's
“
Global Vendor List
”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy
URL
, the purposes for which it
Processes
Personal Information
, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.
In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s
Processing
and/or any purposes for which Quantcast
Processes
Personal Information
on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “
TCF Signal
”).
TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast
Tags
if the digital property on which the
Tag
is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“
CMP
”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the
Bid Requests
it receives from
Advertising Exchanges
. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only
Process
Personal Information
for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.
Read more about the TCF here
https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/
Imported Data
Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“
API
”). Imported Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include information relating to your
Online data
or
Offline data
or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see
Client Data
or
Third Party Data
.
Imported Data (Client)
See
Client Data
.
Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)
See
Third Party Data
.
Imprecise/Approximate Location Information
Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.
Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.
Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from
IP Addresses
.
Inferences/Inferred Data
Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
, or
Third Party Data
. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
as part of a set of device
Attributes
.
For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as
Interests
, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.
Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an
Audience
.
Interests
Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and
Inferences/Inferred Data
.
IP Address
An IP (“
Internet Protocol
”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.
An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a
Pseudonymous Identifier
.
Labels/Label Data
Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with
Pseudonymous Identifiers
to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all
Pseudonymous Identifiers
associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.
Labels processed by Quantcast are:
Labels from
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
: these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a
Pseudonymous Identifier
;
Custom-
Client Data
Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
Inferred Data
Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a
Pseudonymous Identifier
, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see
Inferences/Inferred Data
) or may be
Imported Data
(see
Client Data
and
Third Party Data

Log Data
Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our
Processing
, we use more precise terms, such as
Pseudonymous Identifiers
,
Event Data
,
Bid Request Data
,
Client Data
,
Third Party Data
, and/or
Inferences/Inferred Data
, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the
Pseudonymous Identifiers
, will not qualify as
Personal Information
. For example, a single time zone and publisher
URL
without an associated
Pseudonymous Identifier
would not qualify as
Personal Information
.
Online Data
Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.
Offline Data
Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.
Panel
A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.
This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.
Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.
Personal Information
Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”
The Personal Information
Processed
by Quantcast is limited to
Pseudonymised Identifiers.
Quantcast does not
Process
Personal Information
that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive
HTTP Header Information
, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.
Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:
Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match
Pseudonymous Identifiers
between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
Probabilistic Identifier
A Probabilistic Identifier is a
Pseudonymous Identifier
which we create by combining
Pseudonymous Identifiers
(such as
IP Addresses
) with
Bid Request Data
and/or
Event Data
using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using
Cookie IDs
, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.
Process
Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon
Personal Information
or sets of
Personal Information
, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Pseudonymous Identifiers
Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.
Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.
We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:
Third Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
First Party Cookie ID: see
Cookie ID
.
IP Addresses
.
Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
Device ID
.
Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a
Bid Request
that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
Probabilistic Identifier
.
Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
TLS Session ID: when you visit a website
URL
that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information
Pseudonymised Information is
Personal Information
that has been
Processed
in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.
Segment Data
Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by
Clients
or
Third Party Data Partners
. Segment Data is
Pseudonymised Information
, which may include
Online Data
and/or
Offline Data
as well as
Attributes
,
Inferences
, or
Interests
inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a
Label
(in which case it is referred to as “
Label Data
”).

TCF
See
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework
.
TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose
The
TCF
has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the
TCF
. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.
Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the
TCF
to establish the legal basis to
Process
Personal Information
and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.
For detailed descriptions of TCF “Purpose” or TCF “Special Purpose”, see
IAB Transparency & Consent Framework

Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID
See
Cookie
.
Third Party Data
Third Party Data is
Imported Data
that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party
Data Management Platforms and Data Providers
. Third Party Data may include
Segment Data
.
Training Data
Training Data is
Pseudonymous Information
that we receive from Clients and third party data providers, where the actual
Attributes
or
Interests
of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various
Interests
and
Attributes
, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make
Inferences
. When our systems subsequently receive
Event Data
relating to a user, we can infer whether the
Event Data
displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the
Event Data
displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely
Attributes
and
Interests
of the user to whom the
Event Data
relates. These
Inferences
are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as
www.quantcast.com
; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an
IP Address

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners is for Quantcast publisher partners and clients (“publishers”) who include Quantcast code, such as pixels or tags, on their websites for Quantcast Measure or the Quantcast QID Module in Prebid. It documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for publishers, which are in addition to the
US Data Privacy Addendum
(the “DPA”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPA, the DPA is the controlling document.
Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.
Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.
This document does not contain legal advice, and adherence to this document does not ensure legal compliance. Publishers must ensure for themselves that they operate in a legal manner, based on their particular circumstances. In the event of any conflict between this document and applicable laws or regulations, the laws or regulations should prevail.
Terminology
This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.
When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.
We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Industry standards and self-regulatory programs
Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Publishers are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.
Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.
Unfortunately, terms used across jurisdictions that describe the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data.
Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a “controller” of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels dropped on your sites. This document, together with the Quantcast agreement under which you access our services, addresses our respective GDPR compliance responsibilities. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party” unless agreed otherwise.
Notice/Transparency and Choice
Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.
When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, including Quantcast Measure tags and the QID prebid module, publishers are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, publishers have to make sure of notice and choice for their own collection and processing of personal data.
At minimum, and further subject to any other applicable laws or rules, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising and advertising measurement), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice, and a link to Quantcast’s
privacy policy
be included.
Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching, and cross-device matching (using passively collected data). The data Quantcast collects includes information about users’ visits to sites, such as IP address, device information, timestamp, referrer URL, etc.
Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods, and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.
For their part, publishers need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Publishers should, at minimum, and subject to any additional legal requirements provide a link to the geographically relevant industry opt-out page, including but not limited to
YourAdChoices
and the
NAI
in the US,
Your Online Choices
in Europe, and
Your Ad Choices
in Canada.
In all cases, publishers should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.
Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.
Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, publishers are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained. Publishers must not send to Quantcast, or enable Quantcast to collect, personal data without having established required permissions, and certainly not if the user has explicitly opted out.
EU and the UK
: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the publisher has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such publishers may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these TCF requirements.
Publishers not using the TCF for EU or UK users may, only with Quantcast’s express written permission, use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF. In any case, publishers should not allow data to be collected by, or transmitted to, Quantcast on their sites without user consent, and must be able to provide proof of consent to Quantcast, upon request.
Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.
US
: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.
California
: The CCPA applies for users in California. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. Unless agreed otherwise with Quantcast, Quantcast acts as a “third-party,” as defined under the CCPA, with respect to personal data it collects or receives from publishers’ sites. Quantcast will check the US Privacy String,
as specified by the IAB
.
Other US states:
Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and elsewhere. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
US State Privacy Addendum
: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US Data Privacy Addendum,
which is available here
.
Access and Deletion
Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, when acting as a controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for honoring users’ access and deletion requests with respect to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services.
Other Matters
Sensitive data
. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category data” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, publishers must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.
Directly identifying personal data
. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and publishers may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Reidentification
. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.
Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”
Notice/Transparency and Choice
Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.

Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).
Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.
For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.
In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.
Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

Access and Deletion
Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data
after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.
Other Matters
Sensitive data. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law (including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or related to health status or treatment) or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. Sensitive data also includes any data that qualifies as “consumer health data” under the Washington My Health My Data Act, 2023 Wash. Laws 191 or any other equivalent laws.
Directly identifying personal data. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast’s
privacy policy
be included.
Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).
Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.
For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.
In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.
Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.
Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained.
EU and the UK: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform.
Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these requirements.
Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.
Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.
US: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.
California: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
Other US states: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.
US State Privacy Addendum: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum,
which is available here
.
Access and Deletion
Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.
Other Matters
Sensitive data. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law (including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or related to health status or treatment) or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. Sensitive data also includes any data that qualifies as “consumer health data” under the Washington My Health My Data Act, 2023 Wash. Laws 191 or any other equivalent laws.
Directly identifying personal data. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Reidentification. Under no circumstances will clients and other partners use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
and the
International Data Privacy Addendum
(collectively, the “DPAs”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.
Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.
Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.
Terminology
This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.
When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.
We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.
Industry standards and self-regulatory programs
Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.
Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.
Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.
Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”

We partner with other companies to help us provide and improve our services and products. Sometimes, it is necessary for us to share information that could be considered to be personal information about you with these partners. (Remember that we don’t share directly identifiable information about consumers, such as your name or address, because we do not collect that type of information, as discussed in our
Products and Services Privacy Policy
).

Ad Serving
The companies in this category serve digital advertisements on various digital platforms such as the web, social media, or mobile apps, and issue reports on the performance of advertising campaigns (e.g., the number of users who saw a particular ad, the particular ad type that was served, etc.). We need to use these vendors to deliver and measure the advertising campaigns that we serve. To do this, these vendors collect and use certain identifiers, such as the IP address of the visitor to the digital platform (e.g. to deliver the ad to that visitor’s browser or device) and an identifier specific to the advertisement (so they can identify the ad they need to serve and measure).

Ad Verification
These companies provide a technology to ensure that digital advertisements appear on intended sites and reach the targeted audience; examples include measuring the viewability of an ad, brand safety and fraud (e.g., whether a site is safe for the particular advertiser’s brand or whether it is a fraudulent site). We use these vendors in order to better meet the requirements of our clients and deliver more effective advertising. These companies collect and use certain identifiers, such as the IP address of the visitor to the digital platform and an identifier specific to the advertisement (so that they can pass these details to the ad server, if they determine it is appropriate for the ad server to deliver the ad).

v. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is solely responsible for all amounts payable for Third-Party Services (defined below) and the cost of placing the AdChoices or similar icon (“
Third-Party Costs
”), whether Quantcast includes such Third-Party Costs on its invoices or Company pays such Third-Party Costs directly.

Without limiting the foregoing, throughout the term of the IO, the parties agree to adhere to Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self- regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“
DAA
”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“
NAI
”). If a change in Applicable Privacy Laws or self- regulatory principles necessitates a change to these IO Terms, the parties will work together in good faith to agree to appropriate revisions. “
Applicable Privacy Laws
” means all applicable international, federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to personal data or personal information, as may be amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and any EU Member State laws implementing the GDPR, the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “
GDPR
”), the e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (collectively, “
ePD
”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 – 1798.199), as amended, including by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”).
ii. Each party will (a) prominently display a user-friendly, easily-accessible, clear, and comprehensive privacy policy on its website or mobile application that complies with all applicable laws (including Applicable Privacy Laws) and applicable self- regulatory principles; and (b) if and as applicable, provide website or application visitors in its privacy policy (i) notice that its website, application, or service permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the data collected and the means of collection, and (iii) a link to an industry-standard opt- out mechanism, such as the
NAI
or
DAA
opt out page.
iii. Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of a user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties directed at children. “Direct Identifier” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID or other digital identifiers. For purposes of these IO Terms, “children” refers to anyone age 16 or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.
iv. These IO Terms incorporate (i) the
US State Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and (ii) the
International Data Privacy Addendum
to the extent that the Services include processing of personal data that is subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum).
In addition, Company will comply with Quantcast’s then-current
Campaign and Data Policy
and
Privacy Requirements
(collectively the “
Campaign Policy
”). All of the foregoing linked adden
da and policies constitute “Policies” under the 4As Terms.
g.
Viewability
i.
Viewability Calculation
:
Viewability is calculated as the number of in-view impressions divided by the number of vendor-measured, delivered impressions served across the entire campaign. The percentage viewability for measured impressions will be imputed to unmeasured impressions.
ii.
Viewability Goal
:
If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will optimize delivery towards the applicable Viewability Goal.
iii.
Viewability Guarantee
:
If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will provide the Viewability Guarantee. Such guarantee will only be offered for video placements, Search Powered Audiences, Demographic Audiences, and Data Partner Audiences.
a.
Makegood
. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.
b.
Conditions
.
1.Viewability Vendor must be MRC accredited. Other than for MOAT, Company will provide Quantcast with the Viewability Vendor’s daily reporting.
2. Company must raise any viewability dispute within 30 days of the campaign end date.
3. Lowering the viewability requirement during a campaign voids the guarantee.
4. Makegood impressions expire 90 days from the campaign end date.
5. At its discretion, Quantcast may issue a credit memo for the value of makegood impressions.
iv.
vCPM
:
If a placement uses a vCPM pricing model, Company will only be billed for viewable (or “in-view”) impressions (regardless of the percentage of viewability) as reported by the Viewability Vendor (specified in the placement on the IO).
h
.Third-Party Ad Server
:
If Company is using a third-party ad server, Company will provide Quantcast log-in access to each Ad Server listed in the placements above within 24 hours of campaign start date for reporting access (including conversions, if applicable).
j.
Additional Company Representation and Warranty
.
i. Company represents and warrants that it will comply with all applicable laws and has obtained all necessary licensure for performance hereunder, and that Ads will not infringe or violate any applicable laws, ordinances, rules, codes, or regulations (including, without limitation, any industry-specific ethical, professional, or self-regulatory requirements or guidelines, and Applicable Privacy Laws) or the rights of any third party. If Company is an Agency (as defined in the 4As Terms), Company also represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind its Clients to these IO Terms and each IO, and that all of Company’s actions related to these IO Terms and each IO will be within the scope of such agency.
k.
For Placements Priced on a CPA basis.
i.
Company agrees to pay Quantcast for the conversions and click-thru conversions as stated within the applicable placement. The conversion is defined as from both click-thru and view-thru conversions.
I.
IAB Ads.txt Principles
:
Quantcast supports the principles of IAB initiative ads.txt and recommends all publishers adopt ads.txt as soon as possible. For inventory where we crawl a non-empty ads.txt file, Quantcast will only consider buying inventory from authorized sellers.
m.

Platform
”), the following terms apply:

Authorized Users
”) with view only access to the Platform. Quantcast will set up the initial Authorized Users requested by Company. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is required to maintain at least one Authorized User, and access credentials for that user, during the Services. Each Authorized User will have the ability to add new Authorized Users and terminate access for existing Authorized Users. Company may also request that Quantcast add additional Authorized Users (email being sufficient for such requests). Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users and all activity under its account, including maintaining the confidentiality of its account logins and passwords and shall immediately notify Quantcast in writing of any loss or involuntary disclosure thereof. Company shall ensure that all Authorized Users (a) use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, as Company is authorized to access and use the Services under these IO Terms, and (b) are aware of, and comply with, all requirements and restrictions described in these IO Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Company shall be liable for any breach of these IO Terms by any Authorized User.
ii. Subject to these IO Terms, during the term of the IO and for any additional period permitted by Quantcast, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform solely to (a) view campaigns set-up in the Platform as part of the Services, and/or (b) view reports generated by the Services.

v.For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing and improving the Services.
n.

Client
”), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with their written request (including, without limitation, sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Platform). For clarity, “
Client Data
” means the (i) data Quantcast receives from campaign tag(s) placed by or on behalf of Company or its Clients on websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data.

d.

Quantcast cannot guarantee the continued availability or pricing of such Third-Party Services, or any features thereof, and may cease enabling access to them without liability to Company, if, for example and without limitation, the provider of a Third-Party Service ceases to make the Third-Party Service available for interoperation with the corresponding Service in a manner acceptable to Quantcast. Company irrevocably waives any claim against Quantcast with respect to such Third-Party Services.
Quantcast is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with Company’s receipt, enablement, access or use of any such Third-Party Services, or Company’s reliance on the privacy practices, data security processes or other policies of such Third-Party Services.

da and policies constitute “Policies” under the 4As Terms.
g.
Viewability
i.
Viewability Calculation
:
Viewability is calculated as the number of in-view impressions divided by the number of vendor-measured, delivered impressions served across the entire campaign. The percentage viewability for measured impressions will be imputed to unmeasured impressions.
ii.
Viewability Goal
:
If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will optimize delivery towards the applicable Viewability Goal.
iii.
Viewability Guarantee
:
If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will provide the Viewability Guarantee. Such guarantee will only be offered for video placements, Search Powered Audiences, Demographic Audiences, and Data Partner Audiences.
a.
Makegood
. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.
b.
Conditions
.
1.Viewability Vendor must be MRC accredited. Other than for MOAT, Company will provide Quantcast with the Viewability Vendor’s daily reporting.
2. Company must raise any viewability dispute within 30 days of the campaign end date.

4. Makegood impressions expire 90 days from the campaign end date.
5. At its discretion, Quantcast may issue a credit memo for the value of makegood impressions.
iv.
vCPM
:
If a placement uses a vCPM pricing model, Company will only be billed for viewable (or “in-view”) impressions (regardless of the percentage of viewability) as reported by the Viewability Vendor (specified in the placement on the IO).
h
.Third-Party Ad Server
:
If Company is using a third-party ad server, Company will provide Quantcast log-in access to each Ad Server listed in the placements above within 24 hours of campaign start date for reporting access (including conversions, if applicable).

If Company is an Agency (as defined in the 4As Terms), Company also represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind its Clients to these IO Terms and each IO, and that all of Company’s actions related to these IO Terms and each IO will be within the scope of such agency.
k.

Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the
Information Collection
section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the
Information use and legal basis
section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Information use and legal basis
See
Key Terms

As described in the
Who we are and what we do
section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.
We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:
the purposes for which Quantcast Processes Personal Information ,which are tied to the defined purposes for Processing, special purposes, and features set forth in the
TCF Policies
and official technical documentation disseminated by IAB Europe where applicable(see Appendix A of the
TCF Policies
for examples and illustrations of the purposes, special purposes and features)
a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.
Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “Legitimate Interests” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

International transfers
See
Key Terms
for definitions of capitalized terms.
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy[at]quantcast[dot]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Clients for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.
To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights

Quantcast Privacy Choices
page.
Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the
Information Collection
section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the
Information use and legal basis
section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Key Terms

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy[at]quantcast[dot]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Capitalised terms used in this Products and Services Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) are defined in
Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.
To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights
below), please visit the
Quantcast Privacy Choices

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Personal Information
relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Personal Information
collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of
Personal Information
in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click

Any third parties’ handling of
Personal Information,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the

.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).

relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:

International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your
Personal Information
may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your
Personal Information
internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your
Personal Information
to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for
Personal Information
. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for
Personal Information
that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection.  You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of
Personal Information
or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Processing
of your

Processing
of your
Personal Information

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.
To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights
below), please visit the
Quantcast Privacy Choices
page.
Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Personal Information
relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Personal Information
collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of
Personal Information
in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click
here
.
Any third parties’ handling of
Personal Information,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.
We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the
Key Terms
.
California Notice at Collection: We collect the categories of
Personal Information
listed in the “
Categories of personal information collected
” subsection of the “
California privacy rights

“Information use and legal basis”
section below, we collect this information in order to deliver the Solutions and conduct our business. To learn more, please see the “
California privacy rights

Self-regulatory standards

International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your
Personal Information
may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your
Personal Information
internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your
Personal Information
to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for
Personal Information
. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for
Personal Information
that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection.  You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of
Personal Information
or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found below.

Right of rectification/correction: The right to request that we rectify (or correct) inaccurate
Personal Information
about you. In practice, if you seek to exercise your right of rectification/correction, due to the limited

Right to object (legitimate interests): The right to object to the
Processing
of your

Processing
your

Processing
of your
Personal Information
is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject or for the exercise or defense of legal claims. Additionally, in order to protect your privacy, we may require proof of your identity before we can act on your request but only where it is necessary and proportionate to request this information.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.
Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via
dpo@quantcast.com
.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing
that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Capitalised terms used in this Products and Services Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) are defined in
Key Terms
unless otherwise defined herein.
To exercise your Data Subject Rights (described in the
Your choices and legal rights
below), please visit the
Quantcast Privacy Choices
page.
Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.  As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match
Personal Information
about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast
Pixels, Tags or SDKs
(which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or
Offline Data
. This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine
Personal Information
that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called
Cross-Media Matching/Linking
. To the extent that we combine
Personal Information
that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
Personal Information
, otherwise obtain and
Process
it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.  As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the
Transparency and Consent Framework
(“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the
TCF
is one means of explaining
Processing
activities, and because our
Processing
activities are consistent globally, the
TCF Purposes
are applicable to all
Personal Information
that we
Process
(regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.
Personal Information
relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International  Limited is the controller of your
Personal Information
if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of
Personal Information
for the Solutions only.  This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Personal Information
collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of
Personal Information
in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click

.
Any third parties’ handling of
Personal Information,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.
We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the
Key Terms
.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing
(i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated
Processing

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In
Processing
Personal Information
in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your
Personal Information
will be
Processed
. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for
Personal Information
that is collected as Quantcast
Cookies
, or using
Pixels, Tags and SDKs
deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the
Processing
of other
Personal Information
introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and
Process
the
Personal Information
.  In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of
Personal Information
when we are
Processing
it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast
Pseudonymous Identifier
or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.
Your choices and legal rights
Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your
Personal Information
. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the
Your choices and legal rights
section above.  .
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via

.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated
Processing

Who we are and what we do
Quantcast (“
we
”, “
our
”, or “
us
”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “
Clients
”) understand and grow their audiences (the “
Solutions
”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and
Audiences
with the right advertising.
To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses
Personal Information
for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “
Information Collection
” section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your
Online Data
from your visits across different digital properties, like websites or mobile apps, that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “
Information use and legal basis
” section below, we use the Transparency and Consent Framework (“
TCF
”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).
In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.
Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of Personal Information for the Solutions only. This Privacy Policy does not cover:
Quantcast’s privacy management products, which include our TCF consent management platform (“CMP”), Quantcast Choice. For more information about Quantcast Choice, please click here.
Personal Information collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of Personal Information in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click
here
.
Any third parties’ handling of Personal Information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.
We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the
Key Terms
.

Information use and legal basis
As described in the “
Who we are and what we do
” section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.
We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:
the purposes for which Quantcast Processes Personal Information (which are tied to the defined purposes for Processing, special purposes, and features set forth in the
TCF Policies
and official technical documentation disseminated by IAB Europe where applicable),
a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.
Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “
Legitimate Interests
” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

Relevant third parties as part of a corporate transaction
In the event of a reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share your Personal Information with (or transfer your Personal Information to) certain third parties, such as the acquiring entity and its advisors. We may also make certain information available to a potential investor or purchaser (and their advisers) in advance of any such transaction’s completion.
All or certain categories of Personal Information are shared only as necessary or appropriate.

We employ appropriate organisational and technical security safeguards designed to keep Personal Information secure when it is transmitted to us and once we receive it. These measures may include encryption and employment of information storage security technologies to restrict access to our network. However, please be aware that no method of transmitting information over the internet or storing information is completely secure.
Information retention
We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in the “
Information Collection
” section above, except where we are required to retain the information for a longer period of time. Once Personal Information has reached its retention period, as applicable, we may either de-identify it (for CCPA purposes), anonymise it (for GDPR purposes) or permanently delete it.
International transfers
Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.
If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the
European Commision
and/or the
UK government
as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.
In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.
Additional disclosures for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.
6.4.

The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.
