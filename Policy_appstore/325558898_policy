1. Introduction
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal health information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our Apps, which are designed to help you monitor various aspects of your health.
2. Information Collection and Use
2.1 User-Inputted Health Data
Our Apps are designed to help you monitor various aspects of your health. While we do not collect or have access to this information, our Apps do allow you to input and store health-related data such as:
Blood pressure readings
Blood cholesterol levels
Blood glucose levels
Body temperature measurements
Pulse/heart rate readings
Body weight and height
Other health metrics relevant to each specific App
This data is stored locally on your device and, if you choose to enable it, in your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to us or any third parties.
2.2 App Usage Data
Our Apps do not collect usage data or analytics about how you use the App.
2.3 Device Permissions
Some of our Apps may request access to your device's camera, microphone, or health database to provide certain functionalities. For example:
Camera access may be used for pulse measurement features
Microphone access may be used for voice note features, if available
Health database access is used for integration with Apple's HealthKit
You can grant or revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings. Denying these permissions may limit some App functionalities but will not prevent you from using the core features of the Apps.
2.4 Advertisements
Some of our Apps may include advertisements. If you interact with these ads, some non-personal information may be shared with the ad service provider (such as Google AdMob). This information is used to serve relevant ads and is not linked to your health data. You can use iOS permissions to opt out of ad tracking.
2.5 Use of Information
The health data you enter into our Apps is used solely within the App to provide you with health tracking and monitoring features. This includes generating charts, reports, and other visualizations of your health data. We do not have access to this data and do not use it for any purpose outside of the App's functionality.
3. Use of Information
The data you enter into our Apps is used solely to help you track and monitor your health. We do not have access to this data and do not use it for any purpose.
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your data with any third parties. The Apps provide features for you to generate reports or export your data, which you can then choose to share with others (such as your healthcare provider) at your discretion.
5. Data Storage and Security
5.1 Local Storage
All data is stored locally on your device using Core Data.
5.2 Cloud Storage
If you enable iCloud sync, your data will also be stored in your personal iCloud account. Please refer to
Apple's Privacy Policy
for information about how Apple handles data stored in iCloud.
5.3 Security Measures
To protect your data, our Apps implement the following security measures:
Option to set up a security lock code
Biometric authentication (such as Face ID or Touch ID)
6. User Rights and Control
You have full control over your data. You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time within the Apps. We do not have access to your data and cannot assist with data retrieval or modification.
7. Children's Privacy
Our Apps do not have any age restrictions and can be used by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
8. HealthKit Integration
Some of our Apps integrate with Apple's HealthKit framework. This integration allows you to sync data between our Apps and the Apple Health app. We adhere to Apple's guidelines for HealthKit integration:
We only access HealthKit data with your explicit permission.
We do not use HealthKit data for advertising or data mining purposes.
We do not disclose any information gained through HealthKit to third parties.
Please refer to
Apple's Privacy Policy
for more information about how health data is handled within HealthKit.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available within our Apps under the 'Privacy Policy' menu item. The effective date at the top of this policy will be updated to reflect any changes.
10. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:

11. Consent

Privacy Policy
Privacy. That’s Apple.
Privacy.
That’s Apple.
Privacy is a fundamental human right. It’s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That’s the kind of innovation we believe in.
Apple Intelligence.
Great powers come
with great privacy.
Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.
On-device
processing
allows Apple Intelligence to be aware of your data without collecting your data.
On-device processing
The cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on‑device processing, which gives Apple Intelligence the ability to fulfill many of your requests without leaving your device.
Deeply integrated into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac
Powered by Apple silicon
Designed to protect your privacy at every step
Private Cloud Compute
extends the privacy of Apple devices for more complex requests.
Private Cloud Compute
Some requests require more computational power than what fits in your pocket. For these more complex requests, Apple Intelligence can draw on Private Cloud Compute and extend the privacy of your Apple devices to Apple silicon servers.
Your data is only used for your requests
Your data is never stored or made accessible to anyone
Independent experts can verify its privacy promise

Locked and Hidden Apps.
Choose
what’s
visible.
Locked and Hidden Apps
Locked apps allow you to show your screen to someone while protecting sensitive areas of your phone. For additional privacy, you can hide a locked app. This removes the hidden app’s name and icon from the Home Screen and search results, and pauses its notifications. You can access locked or hidden apps with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.
Private Browsing.
Powerfully
private.
Private Browsing
When you turn on Private Browsing, Safari won’t save the sites you visit, your searches, or any information from forms you fill out. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections help prevent websites from tracking or identifying your device. And your private browsing windows automatically lock when you’re not using them.
Passkeys.
Simple.
Secure.
So not a
password
.
Passkeys
A passkey eliminates the need for a password by using a unique digital key that only works from the site or app it was created for, so you don’t have to worry about website leaks or phishing. Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices. Just use Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate and you’re done.
Lock Hidden Albums.
Keep Hidden
and Recently
Deleted
photos
private.
Lock Hidden Albums
Your Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos are locked by default and can be unlocked using your device’s authentication method — Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.
Safety Check.
Take
control
in times of crisis.
Safety Check
Safety Check is a section in Settings that helps people in domestic or intimate partner violence situations quickly reset the access they’ve granted to others. It also helps you manage which people and apps you’ve given access to.

App Tracking Transparency.
Decide which
apps are
allowed to
track
track
track
track
you.
App Tracking Transparency
Make more informed choices about the apps you use and the permissions you grant them. Apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. And you can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in Settings.
Mail Privacy Protection.
Read
Read
,
delete
,
and
reply
with peace
of mind.
Mail Privacy Protection
Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.
Our apps mind their business. Not yours.
Safari throws trackers off your trail.
Safari
Some websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari toolbar.
When you use Private Browsing, the details of your browsing aren’t saved, and the websites you visit aren’t shared with your other Apple devices. And starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Private Browsing locks your private browsing windows when you’re not using them, completely blocks known trackers from loading on pages, and removes tracking added to URLs as you browse.

Health keeps your records under wraps.
Health
From your heart rate to your menstrual cycle, apps and devices for your health can give you insight into some of your most personal details. With the Health app, you’re in charge of what information you’d like to include, what not to, and who has access to it.
When you do want to securely share your health data from the Health app with your doctors, they’ll see the data you shared in a dashboard in the provider’s health records system.
All of your data is encrypted and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. So however you use the Health app, you’re always in control of your data.
Wallet and Apple Pay help hide what you buy.
Wallet and Apple Pay
When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.
When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.
Maps makes your location history, history.
Maps
Where you go says a lot about you. Maps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. And because Maps doesn’t include a sign-in, where you go isn’t associated with your Apple Account at all.
Personalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly changing.
Photos lets you choose who has the full picture.
Photos
Your photo and video albums are full of precious moments, friends, and your favorite things. Apple devices are designed to give you control over those memories.
Photos is also designed so that the face recognition and scene and object detection — which power features like For You, Memories, Sharing Suggestions, and the People album — happen on device instead of in the cloud. In fact, the A13 Bionic and later chips perform over 100 billion operations per photo to recognize faces and places without ever leaving your device. And when apps request access to your photos, you can share just the images you want — not your entire library.
Messages are only seen by who you send them to.
Messages
From inside jokes to invitations, a lot of life happens in text and video chats. Every blue-bubble message, picture, Animoji, and video is encrypted while being sent between devices.
Smart suggestions in Messages, like pulling up photos to send based on who you’re messaging, are all done on your device.
Siri learns what you need. Not who you are.
Siri
Siri was designed from the beginning to learn your preferences without sharing your identity with Apple or anyone else. You don’t sign in with your Apple Account to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your device thanks to the power of the Apple Neural Engine.
When Apple does process or store data on our servers, it’s associated with a random identifier — a long string of letters and numbers. That data is used only to improve Siri, and we never share or sell it. Apple doesn’t retain audio of your requests unless you choose to share it with us to improve Siri.
Apple News leaves what you read off the record.
Apple News
Many news sources keep track of your identity and create a profile of you. Apple News delivers personalized content without knowing who you are. The content you read is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple Account.
You get editor-curated content and a personalized newsfeed so you can stay up to date with the latest news and stories. And because Apple News uses machine learning, the more you use it, the better your app gets to know what you like — without Apple ever knowing what you’re into.
App Store shows you what’s in store for your data.
App Store
Every one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at Apple.
When you’re checking out an app, you’ll see its Privacy Nutrition Label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location — and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or data brokers.
