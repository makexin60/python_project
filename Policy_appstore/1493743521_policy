Terms & Services
Welcome to RANDONAUTICA, a real-world adventure game which uses quantum entropy to randomize and output coordinates for the user to journey to. RANDONAUTICA offers a reality driven experience after the user has derived coordinates within the app ("App"). Please read these RANDONAUTICA Terms of Use and any applicable App guidelines (the “Guidelines” and, collectively, “these Terms”), because these Terms govern your use of the App. These Terms also govern your interactions with and use of any RANDONAUTICA products or services (together with Apps, the “Services”).
If you live in the United States, these Terms are entered into between you and Randonauts, LLC., PO BOX 24486 Omaha, NE 68124, USA. If you live in any other country, these Terms are entered into between you and Randonauts Limited Liability Corporation, a company registered to do business under the laws of the United States of America. Randonauts, LLC and Randonauts Limited Liability Corporation are collectively referred to as “RANDONAUTICA,” “we,” or “our” in these Terms.
By using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services. RANDONAUTICA may modify these Terms at any time, and if we do, we will notify you by posting the modified Terms on the
www.randonautica.com
website (the “Site”) and in the App Terms of Use. It’s important that you review any modified Terms before you continue using the Services. If you continue to use the Services, you are bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you should not use the Services.
If you breach these Terms, we may take action against you, including but not limited to terminating your account. You acknowledge that RANDONAUTICA has no obligation to, and will not, reimburse or refund you for Services lost due to involuntary suspension or termination of your account.
​
Privacy.
Our Services are designed to enable you to interact with your surroundings in either: (a) your real world environment or (b) digitally using an online map to view the coordinates provided by the App. To provide the Services, we need your location, and we only use your information where we have a legal basis to do so.
​
Use of the Services.
Safe and Appropriate Use.
While you are using our Services, please be aware of your surroundings, and play and communicate safely. You agree that your use of the Services is at your own risk, and that you will not use the Services to violate any applicable law, regulation, Event policies, or instructions as outlined in these Terms and you will not encourage or enable any other individual to do so.
Further, you agree that in conjunction with your use of the Services you will not make available any unlawful, inappropriate, or commercial Content (defined below). You agree that you will not submit inaccurate, misleading, or inappropriate Content, including data submissions, edits, or removal requests to the trip reports.
RANDONAUTICA does not intend Apps to be medical or health devices, or provide medical, emotional or mental health advice. RANDONAUTICA is a create your own reality adventure game, meaning your involvement with your surroundings is based wholly on your experience as a user and is in no way the responsibility of RANDONAUTICA.
​
Locations and Coordinates.
RANDONAUTICA has a verifiably random process for deriving the points in which the user is given. It is wholly the user’s choice to travel to the coordinates provided. Users should abide by the following guidelines:
Do not trespass on private property
Do not travel to locations that could cause physical harm
Do not travel to locations that appear to be dangerous
Journeys and other location-based activities facilitated by our Services can be dangerous and may take you to difficult to access or potentially treacherous locations. When taking part in such location-based activities, you risk property damage, bodily injury, or death. There are many variables that must be considered prior to engaging in the location-based activities, including: weather, fitness level, terrain features, and outdoor experience. Be prepared and be sure to check the current conditions before heading outdoors. Always exercise common sense and caution.
RANDONAUTICA does not incentivize a user to travel to a location and the provision of locations does not imply that accessing such locations is safe or legal. It is wholly the user’s responsibility to decide if the location is deemed safe in all forms, and legal, to travel to. After location coordinates are provided in the app, RANDONAUTICA is not responsible and will not be made liable for the user’s subjective experience on the journey to the destination. The user agrees that exploring unknown locations is done so at their own risk.
​
Interacting with the Environment and People.
You agree that in conjunction with your use of the Services, you will maintain safe and appropriate contact with other people and environments in the real world. You will not harass, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights of others including their property. You will not trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, nuisance, or liability of any kind. If you have a dispute with any third party relating to your use of Services, you release RANDONAUTICA (and all employees, agents, directors, and officers) from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
