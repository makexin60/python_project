Read our Data Processing Agreement
Dear customer
By 2022 we conclude that we do not use Google Analytics on any of our web-based software products. On two of our marketing websites, we do use Google Analytics with reverse proxy for the pseudonymization of data. All data is located on servers within the EU borders.
Consent and transparency are essential elements to secure the personal data of EU citizens. The main purpose of the GDPR
is to ensure that organizations are in sync with the prerequisites for protecting their customers’ data.
We’ve always held data security as a top priority at AIR SUPPORT A/S, and we’ve been working hard to keep your data, and
the way we administer it, compliant with the new laws.
The Data Processing Agreement between you as a customer and AIR SUPPORT A/S outlines our agreement concerning
the processing of your personal data in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. To see the agreement use the document link in the header.
If you have any questions or inquiries, please reply with a detailed description of your concerns.
We’ll do our best to resolve such issues as soon as possible.
Kind regards,
Peter Gravesen
CCO
