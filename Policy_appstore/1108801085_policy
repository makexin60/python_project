Bella “AI Wellness Coach” privacy policy
By choosing to use Bella (sometimes referred to as an “AI wellness coach”) on the app or website and submitting content, personal information, or other information to Bella, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions.
The content, responses, and outcomes presented by Bella are intended solely for general informational purposes and should not be construed as medical or any other form of professional advice, treatment, or diagnosis. It is imperative to consult a qualified healthcare professional for any inquiries related to medical conditions. Do not ignore professional medical advice or postpone seeking it based on information from Bella. Bella does not assert any warranty or guarantee concerning the accuracy, comprehensiveness, or dependability of the information it provides.
To offer you information, responses, and outcomes, Bella employs a Large Language Model (LLM)  and other artificial intelligence services developed by OpenAI, L.L.C. (“OpenAI”) alongside the Baby2Body knowledge base and our proprietary algorithm. These systems are continually advancing, and due to the inherent nature of LLMs, there might be instances where the results are inaccurate, incomplete, or do not precisely reflect real-world details. It's a good idea to assess the accuracy of the outputs as they pertain to your specific use case, and you can even consider involving human review when necessary. Remember, even in cases where inaccuracies are absent, the information Bella provides is rooted in general pregnancy knowledge and the Baby2Body knowledge base and may not be able to consider your entire individual circumstances, health history, or other pertinent factors. That's why we highly recommend consulting a qualified healthcare professional before making any decisions about your health, your child’s health, or anyone else’s well-being based on the information generated by Bella.
It's important to note that any information you share, including messages, content, and personal details, through Bella, or that Bella collects, will be securely transmitted to our service partner, OpenAI, responsible for our chat and artificial intelligence services. This transmission is essential for us to deliver our Services effectively to you. Bella might store, share, transmit, process, and utilize this information, including your messages, to facilitate our Services, as outlined in our Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions. OpenAI may also process, transmit, and use such information, including communications, as part of delivering our Services to you. Your privacy and data security is of utmost importance to us, and we will remain committed to that in all future developments.
Updates to this privacy policy
We regularly review and, if appropriate, update this privacy policy from time to time, and as our services and use of personal data evolves. If we want to make use of your personal data in a way that we haven’t previously identified, we will contact you to provide information about this and, if necessary, to ask for your consent.
We will update the date of this document each time it is changed.
