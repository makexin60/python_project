PRIVACY POLICIES
INTRODUCTION
We, at Wings Lab Pte. Ltd. ("we," "us," or "our"), recognize the importance our users attach to the handling of their Personal Data (as defined below). This Privacy Policy outlines our data processing practices when visitors and users access our websites and services. We kindly urge you to carefully review this Privacy Policy. Should you have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to us as specified in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy serves as a supplementary document and does not replace any prior consents you may have granted us regarding your Personal Data. Any consents provided in connection with this Privacy Policy add to any rights we hold under applicable law for the handling or processing of your Personal Data.
We retain the right to modify this Privacy Policy periodically. While you should regularly review this Privacy Policy to be informed of any revisions, we may also communicate updates via various means, including notices or alternative forms of communication, as deemed suitable, or as mandated by applicable law.
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
By engaging with us, submitting information to us, or enrolling in any of our products or services on our websites, you acknowledge and consent to our processing of your Personal Data. Such processing may be carried out by our authorized service providers, adhering to the manner and purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Should you disagree with any aspect of this Privacy Policy or find it discomforting, we advise you to cease access or use of our websites and services immediately.
COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
"Personal Data" pertains to (a) data concerning an identified or identifiable natural person; or (b) data analogous to “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or related terms as defined in relevant data protection laws.
The scope and kinds of Personal Data we gather and process hinge on the nature of your interactions with us. In general, the following categories are collected and processed:
Account and profile information, including email addresses, passwords, and/or blockchain wallet addresses;
Payment and transaction information, comprising credit/debit cardholder names, credit/debit card numbers, country, city, state, address, and/or blockchain wallet transactions. We might involve third-party vendors for payment information collection and processing;
Contact information, encompassing usernames in third-party services like Telegram or Discord, first and last names, email addresses, professional titles, company names, and/or phone numbers;
Technical information and usage data, such as site-related and statistical details about visitor arrivals, IP addresses potentially revealing approximate or precise locations, device information, clickstream data, time stamps, and particulars about how our websites and services are utilized. This information might be automatically recorded via server logs or cookies. Further details are provided in the Cookies section below;
Marketing and communications data, involving preferences for receiving marketing communications from us, communication preferences, communication history with us, our service providers, or third parties; and/or
Other information, including participation in contests, promotions, or surveys, along with photographs, videos, and/or audio recordings taken by us or our agents.
We may also collect and process information from third-party sources, such as public records, social media platforms, and blockchain data related to records or transaction histories occurring on the applicable blockchain for a blockchain wallet address.
Additionally, we may provide features that enable users to invite or refer friends or contacts to utilize our services. In such cases, we may collect Personal Data (e.g., contact details) about these invitees or referrals to facilitate outreach. We advise against referring individuals to us or sharing their Personal Data without proper authorization or consent.
While tagging blockchain wallet addresses is intrinsic to our business, we refrain from employing user Personal Data (e.g., blockchain wallet addresses within account or profile information) to append or publish such labels or expose the identity of any natural person as the owner of a given blockchain wallet address. Furthermore, we take measures to ensure no inadvertent identification of blockchain wallet address owners occurs through our technical and organizational arrangements. Exceptions to this rule are limited, such as labeling high-profile public figures who have openly disclosed their blockchain wallet addresses. However, such exceptions account for a negligible percentage of the blockchain wallet address-associated information utilized to deliver our websites and services.
