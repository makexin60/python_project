Online Privacy Policy Generator for Website, Blog, eCommerce or App
Do you have a website, blog, or app on the internet? If yes, then you absolutely need to have a
Privacy Policy
for it.
Today, online privacy is more important than ever. Everyone should care about privacy and
comply with the privacy laws
of the respective jurisdiction.
Many countries have enacted information privacy laws that you are required to follow if you collect information about your users. Likely, your website or mobile app collects, at the very least, the
names and email addresses of your users
.
Often online services ask for more information such as
phone number, residential address, location
, financial details, etc.
You might be asking, what is a privacy policy?
Privacy Policy definition:
Privacy Policy is the document that outlines which information about the users you collect, where this information is stored, and how it will be treated.
Chances are when operating your website or a mobile app, you will need to
collect, process, and store private user information
. When doing it, you will have to comply with the privacy laws of the country where you operate or the country where your users come from.
The first step in making your service compliant  –  is
creating and publishing the privacy policy
for your website or application.
PolicyMaker will help you to create a standard Privacy Policy
for your website or mobile app that should be sufficient for most services.
Data Privacy and Information Privacy Laws
Data privacy, which is also known as
data protection or information privacy
is a very prominent topic in today’s world.
According to Wikipedia
:
Data Privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, legal and political issues surrounding them.
In simple terms, Data Privacy governs how user data is
collected, shared, and used
.
There are many laws in various countries around the world that govern the complex issues of data privacy. Some of the well-known regulations are the
GDPR in European Union
,
CCPA in the California United States
, and
China Internet Security Law
.
We encourage you to make yourself familiar with the
privacy laws
of the countries where you run your business and make sure to follow them.
Why Do I Need a Privacy Policy Statement?
First of all, you need a Privacy Policy statement for your website or app to make a written
commitment to guarding the privacy of your users
. When collecting private information, you become responsible for this data.
Depending on the countries where you are incorporated or operate in, you might be
subject to the privacy laws
, that in most cases, would require you to have a written and published Privacy Policy.
If you decide to publish your app in the app stores, start accepting the payments or monetize your website using ads, you will also likely need to
provide the link to the privacy policy
of your service.
When operating a website or mobile app, you should be ready to answer questions that your users, business partners, or authorities might have about the privacy policy of your service. If you work with other businesses, you will likely need to share with them your privacy policy and
make sure you abide by it
.
Privacy Policy Template
Big companies usually hire
experienced lawyers
to create a privacy policy for their websites and apps. Hiring a professional law firm to create a privacy policy will likely cost a sizable amount of money and could take a lot of time.
The good news is that the majority of privacy policies on the internet today are made from templates that have universal wording. You might be thinking about looking for those templates on the internet and going through them yourself, but please
do not waste your time
!
Our team at PolicyMaker has already done it for you! We
constantly check for the updates on the privacy policy laws
worldwide and update the PolicyMaker with the latest developments.
We create a
VERY simple and universal privacy policy generator
that will save you the time and stress of trying to write the privacy policy yourself by using the templates!
GDPR Compliant Privacy Policy Made For Your Business
General Data Protection Regulation or as many people call it
GDPR
– is the c
ornerstone of the Privacy Protection laws in the European Union
. It was implemented in 2018 and is made to let people control their personal data.
If you have visitors or users that reside in
European countries, you have to comply with GDPR
regulations. We have made it easy for you!
Our team included the clauses that will cover all the necessary GDPR requirements in your Privacy Policy. All you need to do to get a
GDPR compliant Privacy Policy
is to generate it using PolicyMaker and paste the ready-made policy text on your website!
Privacy Policy That Includes Latest 2020 CalOPPA Requirements
CalOPPA is a vital regulation that you need to follow when servicing users that reside in
California, USA
.
The
California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003
is the regulation that requires websites to have clear privacy notice available to users. The privacy policy should satisfy several
CalOPPA requirements
and have appropriate wording.
PolicyMaker offers you a CalOPPA privacy policy generator that follows all the
latest requirements of this legislation
.
Make Your CCPA Privacy Policy Fully Compliant With California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations of 2020
The
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)
went into effect on the 1st of January 2020. It is a relatively new legislation that was only created in 2018.
CCPA was made to further safeguard consumers and their privacy rights
.
CCPA applies to all businesses that serve customers in California
, USA, and satisfy the list of specific criteria.
Some of the abovementioned criteria are:
The business has annual gross revenues of over
25 million USD
The business has personal information of over
50,000 consumers
While this regulation at the moment applies mostly to medium or large businesses, it is easy to imagine how even a small online business can accumulate the
data of over 50,000 consumers
.
That is why your Privacy Policy made by PolicyMaker will, by default, include clauses that will make your business
compliant with CCPA law
.
