To provide you with information about goods or services we feel may interest you.

When we share and disclose information
Jack’s Flight Club does not rent or sell personal information about you to third parties, however, we reserve the right to share the personal information we collect about you with third parties or our service suppliers when we have your consent or pursue our legitimate interests under the following circumstances:
When core features are delivered or supported by third party suppliers who are supplying their services to us as Data Processors for the sole purpose of delivering our Services (e.g. sending emails, storing data);
If you are making a purchase through our Services, we often work with third parties and trusted business partners, such as Stripe, Paypal and Apple, to securely collect your credit card, billing address and other verifying information. Our third party partners are required to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information they receive and/or process on our behalf. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and thus we cannot guarantee its absolute security;
We may provide anonymised data to trusted partners who work on our behalf to communicate with you about offers from Jack’s Flight Club, including to select and serve relevant adverts to you. Typically, no personally identifiable information is passed to our service partners as your usage will be associated with an impersonal ID number or hashed identifier, not your email. Note, these companies do not have any right to use or share your personal data for any other purposes and we do not typically disclose information about identifiable individuals, however they may use aggregate data for statistical purposes;
We may also provide data to our third party analytics partners, such as Google Analytics, Braze, for the purposes of tracking usage information and site traffic. We will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. To opt-out of Google Analytics use of your information, please visit:

If information is collected and used by a third party, you will need to read their Privacy Policy to understand how that information may be used;
We or our review partners (e.g. Trustpilot) may invite you to give feedback or write a review on your personal experience and display the information that you provide us. We may share your email address and information about your use of our Services when we do so but your details will only be used for the purposes of inviting you to give feedback and will not be sold or passed on in turn. When submitting a review you should not provide any personal information that you do not wish to make publicly available. If you wish to update or delete your feedback, you can contact us via the email address at the end of this policy. You may also wish to leave a comment on one of our posts by means of a third party, such as Facebook or Instagram. Please be aware that you may be sharing personal information with these other networks; and
If you purchase certain services for others, we will collect the personal information of the recipients of these services. You must make sure that you have the right to provide such personal information. When you provide any personal information about another person, you must make sure that they agree to the provision of their information to us for us to collect, use and disclose such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If an individual whose personal information you have provided us wishes to request the removal of their personal information they can contact us via the details at the end of this Policy.
In addition, we may share your personal information with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, courts with competent jurisdictions, emergency services or other necessary third parties for legal, protection, security, and safety purposes, including:
to comply with legal requirements, orders, or proceedings;
to comply with laws or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests and legal process;
to perform fraud or credit checks, report or collect debts owed;
to protect the rights and property of Jack’s Flight Club, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use and protecting our network and physical assets; and/or
to protect the safety of our employees and agents, our customers, or any person.
Furthermore, if we have a legal basis to do so (such as legitimate interests or for purposes required by law), we may share your data with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, parent company and its subsidiaries and affiliate companies in which Jack’s Flight Club has control through either direct or indirect ownership.
Finally, we may transfer, share, or disclose your personal information to third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process such as a merger, acquisition, and/or a sale of all, substantially all, or part of our assets, and/or a licensing agreement with third parties. Jack’s Flight Club will provide you with notice before your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy unless the privacy policy remains tied to Jack’s Flight Club's own practices.
Tracking technologies
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically, process it on our servers and store it. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date and timestamps of your clickstream data and of your events and interactions with our Services. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information you provide or we collect about you in order to improve the services we offer you, improve our marketing efforts, perform analytics, or improve site functionality.
Jack’s Flight Club and our technology, affiliate, service or marketing partners, may use cookies, server side event tracking, “pixel” tags and scripts to monitor and analyse your use of our Services, to recognise you and personalise our Services to your preferences and to provide an automatic log-in process. Typically, no personally identifiable information is passed to our partners as your usage will be associated with an impersonal ID number or hashed identifier, not your email. If you prefer, you may set your computer preferences to decline cookies. Note, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all the features of our Services. For more information about our use of cookies, see our Cookies policy below.
We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. In addition, we may partner with an ad network, which may use cookies, server side event tracking and “pixel” tags to collect information on your activities on this and other websites, to provide you targeted advertisements based on your interests. We do not directly disclose email addresses and personal information about identifiable individuals to our ad networks or advertisers, but we may provide them with impersonal ID numbers or hashed identifiers (from which they may be able to associate you with an existing user profile in their systems) as well as aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking

Confidentiality and security of your personal information
Jack’s Flight Club takes industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to protect your user information under our company's control against loss, misuse, or alteration. When you enter a credit card number on our website, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will put in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Jack’s Flight Club websites include links to other websites owned or operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from those of Jack’s Flight Club and are also likely to use cookies. For example, our website can contain links to and from third party websites of advertisers, hotels, tour operators and partner merchants. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and the information you submit is governed by their privacy policy. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Data transfer and storage outside of the EEA
The personal information we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at, destinations inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
Some of the jurisdictions outside of the EEA offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and have implemented the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or make sure your data is protected by a vendor’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules.
By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
Third Party widgets
Our Site and Mobile App include social media features, such as ‘share this’ buttons and widgets, or interactive mini-programs such as live chat support via Helpscout. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this Policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Site or our Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
Single sign on
Our Services may offer you the ability to register and login using federated third party account details (like your Google or Facebook logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from the federated account provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public. If you login using Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to your account, such as friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you through our Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third party account provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
Data retention
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Jack’s Flight Club.
Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future. This record will be kept for as long as we retain your personal data in accordance with this section.
We may retain certain information associated with your account in our archives, including for analytical purposes as well as for recordkeeping integrity. The periods for which we retain your information depend on the purpose for which we collected it and we use it.
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you request termination of your Jack’s Flight Club account, it is our practice to deactivate your account and block further email deliveries to you within ten business days.
