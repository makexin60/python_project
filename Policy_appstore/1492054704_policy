If your personal data is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (
GDPR
) protection, please be aware that while 12GO collects and transfers your personal data outside the EEA, 12GO always complies with the GDPR provisions in order to ensure the level of protection of personal rights available inside the EEA.

12GO may also share your personal data with the following third parties for the purposes described hereof:
■   government authorities, law enforcement bodies, regulators and airports in your itinerary and for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other similar legal instruments;
■   audit organisations (auditors) for carrying out an audit upon their request and only in cases when it is required for the conduction of such an audit;

12GO may choose to comply with or disregard such requests or orders in its sole discretion.
PERSONAL DATA STORING AND SECURITY:
All your personal data is collected, processed, and kept for internal record keeping as required by the applicable laws and regulations. 12GO only processes your personal data where it is necessary to do so. The legal basis will depend on the reasons 12GO has to collect and use your personal data.
Personal data that 12GO processes for any purpose shall not be retained for longer than it is necessary for those purposes and under the applicable laws and regulations. Where it is impossible to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained, 12GO will determine the period of retention based on the purposes of collecting your personal data and the exhaustion of the need to retain it. For the purposes of determining the appropriate retention period, 12GO considers the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data and the purposes for which the personal data is collected and processed. For example, the expected data retention period is ten (10) years from the date at which the services were terminated.
When 12GO no longer needs personal data, it will be securely deleted or destroyed. 12GO will also consider if and how 12GO can minimise over time personal data processed by 12GO and if it can be anonymised so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case 12GO may use that information without further notice to you.
Notwithstanding the other provisions herein, 12GO may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with any legal obligation to which 12GO is subject or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person or persons.
12GO is committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, 12GO has put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information collected online.
In case 12GO discloses your personal data to the trusted Carriers, Suppliers and/or third-party partners for the purposes set out in the 12GO’s Privacy Policy, 12GO always requires them to have the appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your personal data.
12GO will not sell, distribute or lease your personal data to any third parties unless 12GO has your permission or it is required by the applicable laws and regulations. 12GO may use your personal data to send you promotional information about the Carriers, Suppliers and/or other third parties, which, in 12GO’s opinion, you may find interesting; however, subject to your prior consent and or its further withdrawal.
YOUR PERSONAL DATA RIGHTS:
Your principal rights towards your personal data provided to 12GO under the 12GO’s Privacy Policy  are:
■   the right to access;
■   the right to rectification;
■   the right to erasure;
■   the right to restrict processing;
■   the right to object to processing;
■   the right to data portability;
■   the right to complain to a supervisory authority, and
■   the right to withdraw consent.
You are also entitled to:
■   request the details of your personal data which 12GO holds about you;
■   restrict the collection or use of your personal data by indicating that you do not want your personal data to be used for direct marketing or promotional purposes which do not directly concern your travel data or data necessary for your booking and purchase of the 12GO’s products and services;
■   to withdraw your consent and delete your personal data at any time by clicking the “delete” buttons provided in your personal profile on the 12GO’s Internet Sites.
The disposal of your personal data is possible only after completing all your booked and purchased 12GO's products and services. If you wish to delete your personal data before completion, 12GO will have to cancel your bookings and purchases. It will be unable to inform you about any unexpected changes, cancellations or other influences on your future travels and/or booked and purchased 12GO’s products and services.
You should be aware that some of your personal data can not be disposed of or deleted for the purpose of complying with the applicable laws and regulations to which 12GO is a subject and/or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person or persons and/or for accounting, billing and audit purposes and/or to detect and/or prevent any fraudulent or money laundering activities.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, 12GO may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Additionally, 12GO may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
You should be aware that 12GO may request specific information from you, which may help 12GO confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information and personal data or exercise any of the other rights. It is a necessary and appropriate security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person with no entitlement for this.
12GO also understands the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children. Accordingly, children under 16 years of age will not be permitted to open any account with 12GO. 12GO will delete any such accounts if 12GO is made aware that it was created by a child under 16 (subject to the
12GO Group General Terms and Conditions
). Where required by applicable law, 12GO may ask for certain information about children from parents or guardians to process a booking or provide other services. If you are a parent and believe we may have inadvertently collected personal data from a minor, please notify us, and we will remove that personal data and unsubscribe that minor from any of our electronic marketing lists. Minors can normally accompany their parent(s) or legal custodian(s) who have booked our services unless prohibited by suppliers' policies.
