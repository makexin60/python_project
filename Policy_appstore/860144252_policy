SMART Technologies ULC Privacy Vision
Vision
Privacy by design and privacy by default.
This Involves
Being proactive, not reactive
Preventative, not remedial
We aim to prevent breaches before they happen by designing our software products to capture as little personal information as possible.
Privacy as the default setting
There are no privacy settings in our products because we don’t want you to share anything except the bare minimum required.
Privacy embedded in the design
Privacy is not an afterthought to us. Privacy is at the core of our software design. The result is that privacy is an essential component at the core of our business.
Full Functionality:
Positive-sum, not zero-sum
We do not sell or trade your personal information. SMART wins because we value your privacy (positive-sum) not because we exploit it (zero-sum).
Security:
Full Lifecycle Protection
We ensure all data is securely stored, transmitted and then destroyed upon your request or at the end of the process in a timely fashion. We only keep what is required for legal and tax reasons.
Visibility and Transparency:
Keep it Open
We tell you exactly what information we collect and what we do with it.
Respect for User Privacy:
Keep it User-Centric
We protect the interests of our users by keeping you informed.

Schedule A - Cookies Used By SMART
Purpose
The following information explains our website privacy policy (the “
Policy
”)  and practices of SMART Technologies ULC (together with its subsidiaries, collectively "
SMART
", “
we
” or “
us
”) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal  information.  The purpose of this Policy  is to make clear what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose this  information, and the ways in which you can help manage the information we  collect.
Application  of this Policy
Click here for SMART Learning Suite’s Terms and Privacy Policy.
This Policy applies to our websites (including
smarttech.com
), offered by SMART (collectively "
Services
").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Services  may have additional and/or specific privacy terms that relate only to such  Service.  When applicable, such  additional terms will be communicated to you at the time you elect to receive such  Service from SMART.
To the extent discrete  elements of certain Services are not directly provided or managed by SMART, you  may be required from time to time to agree to supplemental third party policies  in order to receive such Services from SMART.   For example, if you are a Funterra user, certain information may need  to be provided by you or SMART to third party service providers (including  those involved in hosting user content) in order to facilitate your use of such  product.  In each such instance, SMART  will identify for you any third party elements prior to your use of the  relevant Service.
By using a Service, you are  agreeing to this Policy and consenting to SMART's collection, use and  disclosure of your personal information as necessary for the Identified  Purposes or as otherwise identified herein.
Personal  Information of Children and Minors
There are two primary ways  through which information of minors can be provided to SMART: the information  could be provided directly by the individual or the information could be  provided by the individual’s school.
If you are not of legal age to  form a binding contract in your jurisdiction (i.e. have not yet reached the age  of majority, which in many jurisdictions is 18 years of age), we require that  you or your school obtain your parent’s or guardian’s express consent prior to  disclosing any personal information to us and using any Services.  You should also thoroughly review this Policy  with your parent or guardian to ensure it is understood and accepted.  No personally identifiable information of  individuals under 18 years old should be submitted to or through our Services  without the consent of their parent or guardian.  We do not knowingly collect any information  from individuals under the age of 18 without such consent.
We only collect personal  information through our Services from a child under 18 where that student’s  school, district, and/or teacher has confirmed to us that they have obtained the  requisite, verifiable parental or guardian consent for that child to disclose  personal information to us.  If you are  under 18 please do not send us any personal information unless your school,  district, and/or teacher has obtained the necessary parental or guardian  consents.  For more information regarding  school, district and teacher responsibility to collect consents please see the  applicable Service terms of use or license agreement.
In the case of Services where  SMART stores or manages student personal information, information that is, to our knowledge, provided to us by someone under 18 not  in accordance with these requirements will be deleted where possible (it may  not be possible, for instance, to delete such information where it is embedded  in a collaborative work product created using the Services).  To report information provided without  requisite parental or guardian consent, please contact us at
privacy@smarttech.com
.
We do not condition a minor’s  use of our Services on provision of personal information by such minor beyond  what is reasonably necessary to make the Services function properly.
What is "Personal Information"?
Personal information means any  information about an identifiable individual (e.g. name, home address, resume  information, financial information, health information, photographs, age,  marital status, religion etc.).
To the maximum extent  permitted by applicable law, this Policy is not intended to and does not apply to:
the collection, use or disclosure of personal information for personal, domestic, artistic, literary or journalistic purposes; or
the collection, use or disclosure of "business contact information" (i.e. an individual's name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address,    business e-mail, business fax number and other similar business    information) for the purpose of contacting an individual in their business    capacity.
Collection  of Personal Information
As a general rule, and to the  extent possible, SMART collects personal information directly from the  individual it pertains to.  If third  parties hold information SMART requires to meet the Identified Purposes, it  will endeavor to ensure the information has been collected with the appropriate  consent.
Personal information may be  collected directly from you, from your use of our Services, or from third  parties who provide such information to us as part of a Service you receive  from SMART.  This information may be  collected in person, over the telephone, through the mail, or over the  Internet. When SMART collects personal information from you, we will: (i)  explain how we intend to use such information; (ii) collect only such  information as we believe is reasonably necessary to meet the Identified  Purposes or such other purposes as are communicated to you at the time of  collection; and (iii) not use or disclose such information for any other  unrelated purposes without your consent, unless legally required or entitled to  do so.
As an example, SMART may collect  personal information: (i) when you register to receive personalized information  on its website or from SMART Customer Service; (ii) when you provide  information to gain entry into one of SMART's secure sites; (iii) when you  enter one of SMART's promotions; or (iv) through one of our Services.
Where permitted or required by  applicable law or regulatory requirements, SMART may collect personal  information about an individual without their knowledge or consent.
Using  Your Personal Information
SMART collects and uses  personal information in order to: (i) respond to queries or requests from you;  (ii) process orders from you; (iii) track sales data; (iv) understand your  needs and preferences; (v) develop, enhance, market and provide products and  services; (vi) personalize and facilitate the ease and efficiency of your visit  to our web site; (vii) provide  Services  to you in the most functional and efficient manner; (viii) administer and  discharge our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us; (ix)  manage and develop our business and operations; and (x) meet legal requirements  (collectively the “
Identified Purposes
”).
If you are using a Service  that requires or otherwise involves the use of a third party element, SMART may also collect (whether directly or  through such third party) and use your personal information in order to: (i)  facilitate your access to such Service; (ii) enable you to authenticate your  account with any such third parties, or with SMART through such third parties, using  their authentication or online security services; (iii) aggregate assessment  and other student performance data to help improve student outcomes; and (iv)  store artefacts of work projects such as images or files you attach to work  products in order to optimize delivery.
SMART does not use the  personal information of minors for the purposes of marketing our products or  the products of any third party to such minors, nor do we permit third parties  to do this through our Services.
Sharing  and Disclosing Your Personal Information
Except as set out in this  Policy, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent  unless we are legally required or entitled to do so.  For greater certainty, SMART may share your  personal information with third parties, such as channel partners, service  providers or other organizations: (i) where the third party or SMART has your  consent; (ii) where legally required or entitled to do so; (iii) where the  third party is acting as our agent, contractor or service provider and has  agreed to handle your personal information in confidence and in accordance with  applicable laws; or (iv) where business mergers, divestments or acquisitions  are involved. For example, when you register for certain sales promotions,  SMART may share your personal information with a SMART channel partner that it  reasonably believes will help meet your needs.
SMART may also release  personal information to third parties when such release is in compliance with  applicable law or, if you are a student, SMART is directed to do so by your  school, if SMART believes in good faith that this is necessary to: (i) protect  the safety of SMART and its employees and users, or the safety of others; (ii)  comply with applicable laws; or (iii) enforce terms of use or licenses  associated with our products or services.   To the extent possible we will try to provide you with notice of our  release of information for these reasons.
SMART does not engage in the  collection of personally identifiable information over time and across  third-party web sites except where such collection is required for operation of  the Services.  SMART does track non-personally identifiable  user data in the form of aggregate behavior for the purposes of allowing SMART  to improve the operations of Services. SMART may provide non-personally  identifiable aggregate reports on user behavior to third parties we work with  for the same purpose of improving Services.
If you don't want your  personal information disclosed to others, or if you would like to be removed  from any of SMART's subscription lists, please email
privacy@smarttech.com
.  SMART will not knowingly sell or rent your personal information to any other  organization without your explicit permission except as otherwise set forth  herein in. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SMART may sell or otherwise transfer  the information collected from you to a third party in the event that all or  any portion of SMART is merged or otherwise transferred to the third party, provided  that such third party is bound by appropriate agreements or obligations that  require them to use or disclose your personal information in a manner  consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Policy.
In the event that you are a  minor, SMART reserves the right to provide access to your account to your  parents, guardian or other authorized adult, upon such adult's request.
Security
SMART's business processes are  designed and applied to appropriately safeguard your personal information,  having regard to the sensitivity and use of that information.  Nevertheless, such security measures may not  prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information provided to  SMART, and SMART is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to  any such security failures. By using our Services you understand that there is  a risk that data and communications, including e-mail and other electronic  communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated  over the Internet. The foregoing does not affect any liability which cannot be excluded  or limited under applicable law.
If you have any questions or  concerns regarding the security measures applied to collection, use or  disclosure of your personal information please email
privacy@smarttech.com
.
If you are using a Service  that involves third party elements, please  review the policies of such third party service providers as they relate to  security and data protection.

International  Storage and Transfer of Data
SMART and its service  providers may, from time to time, locate certain computer databases, which  store personal information relating to SMART's products and services, in  countries outside of Canada.  The export  of personal information to such countries is permitted subject to the provision  of adequate levels of protection in relation to the processing of such  information.  As a key part of the  contractual arrangements between SMART and third party service providers, such  parties are required to maintain appropriate levels of security and  confidentiality in respect of personal information.
When appropriate, or otherwise  required by applicable law, you will be provided with notice of the fact that  your personal information may be transferred, stored or processed outside of  Canada.
Access or Updating Personal Information
We aim to keep your personal  information as accurate as possible. If you would like more information about  SMART's privacy practices or would like to request access to or update your personal  information, please contact:
Privacy Officer
privacy@smarttech.com
SMART respects the concerns of  individuals regarding their personal information, and will respond within a  reasonable timeframe and within the time required by applicable law.
Please note that an  individual's right to access the personal information an organization holds  about them is not absolute.  In that  regard, there may be instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements  permit or require SMART to refuse an access request.
Opting  Out or Removing Personal Information
If you would like to request  that your own or your child’s personal information or publicly posted content  be provided to you for your review, be removed from our services, or be  updated, please contact
privacy@smarttech.com
.  If you are accessing a Service through your  school, you may also be able to make such request  through your school administrator.  In  some cases we may not be able to remove the information or continue to provide  Services following removal of such information, in which case we will let you  know if we are unable to do so and why.
If you are the parent or  guardian of a minor and would like to review, remove or change any consents you  may have provided in relation to your child, either to us or to a school,  teacher or administrator, or inform us that you have not given such consent,  please contact us at
privacy@smarttech.com
.
General Information that we Collect
SMART collects general,  non-personal information, such as IP addresses, for system administration and  internal tracking. When you visit SMART's website, our servers log the IP  (internet protocol) address, length of each visit, number of requests per  visit, operating system and browser type. SMART does not link this information  to any personal information that an individual may otherwise voluntarily submit.  SMART may use this general, non-personal  information for any purpose.
Cookie Policy
To enhance your experience  many of our web pages and Services use "cookies". Cookies are small  text files that are placed on your computer or device. Most web browsers allow  some control over cookies through the browser settings. Blocking all cookies  will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of our Services. Thus,  you may prefer to accept cookies and then delete them at a later date or upon  exiting your browser.  In addition, our Services  may contain URLs posted by users to other sites that contain cookies that we are not responsible for.  Cookies and student data will only be used for the provision of the Services.
Additionally, some browsers  have a ‘do not track’ feature that lets you tell web sites that you do not want  to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so  we are currently not set up to respond to those signals. If you block or delete  cookies, please be aware that not all of the tracking described in this policy  will stop.
A table outlining the primary  cookies used by SMART is attached to this Policy as Schedule A.
General
SMART may also monitor your  use of our Services for system management and security purposes, and in order  to detect inappropriate software and unauthorized access. Privacy and  confidentiality may not be possible when using unencrypted Internet  communications.
In cases where SMART uses  third parties to process transactions that include personal information,  reasonable efforts are taken to ensure they apply comparable or higher  standards concerning collection, use and disclosure.
By using SMART's Services, you  signify your agreement with this SMART Privacy Policy. SMART reserves the  right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy  at any time. Please review our web site (
https://www.smarttech.com/legal/privacy-policies
) regularly  for the latest updates to the Policy. Your continued use of our Services  following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy will indicate your  assent to any such changes or amendments.
Your  California Privacy Rights
Under California law, a  California resident with whom SMART has an established relationship has the  right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal  information SMART has shared with third parties for their direct marketing  purposes (if any), and the identities of those third parties, within the  immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. In response  to a written request, SMART is allowed to provide a cost-free means to opt-out  of such sharing. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent  to the address set-out at the end of this Policy.

INTRODUCTION
This privacy policy for Lumio
®
(“
Privacy Policy
”) forms part of the
Terms
agreed upon between you and SMART. This policy explains how SMART works with you to protect your information.
By using Lumio you are consenting to SMART's collection, retention, use, and disclosure of certain information as necessary to provide Lumio to you. If you do not agree, you must not use Lumio.
DATA TYPES
It is important to remember that
customers
and
users
are two distinct groups:
Customers
are typically an organization (e.g., district, school, company) and not a personally identifiable individual. The identifiable information we require is from the customer for transactional purposes. The customer shall not provide SMART with personally identifiable information unless permissible by law and the customers’ policies.
Users
(e.g., teachers, students) are generally not the ones who purchased or set up the account (e.g., IT administrators) and only access Lumio because the customers’ IT administrator has granted them access. As such, SMART’s exposure to personally identifiable information only comes from how the customer operates when providing e-mail addresses and names of users to SMART and from user created Content. If you have a concern as a user about your PII you must demand the customer provide only non-identifiable information to SMART and you as a user must only create Content with no PII in it.
We collect two types of data, depending on your interaction with us:
“
Non-Personal Data
” means aggregated non-identifiable information, which may be made available or gathered via your access to and interactions with our services. We are not aware of the identity or other identifiers of the individual from which the Non-Personal Data is collected. The Non-Personal Data being collected may include aggregated usage information (meta-data), as well as technical information transmitted by your device, such as the type of browser or device, type of operation system, device settings and technical software data, etc.
“
Personal Data
” or “personal information” means individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies a natural person (not a corporation) or may, with reasonable effort, be used to identify a natural person.
We do not knowingly collect or process any Personal Data constituting or revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, or data concerning a person's health (“Special Categories of Personal Data”).
The Customer is responsible for obtaining consent and authorization for a student to use our products and services from their parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Where a customer instructs us to collect personal information from children, we collect, use, process and retain such information solely to provide the educational services on behalf of the customer and for the purpose of providing Lumio.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect and use information to allow us to provide our products and services to you. We collect information from you when you sign up for an account or voluntarily provide additional information.
We also collect information about the navigation pages users visit within Lumio using cookies and third-party analytics tools. This information includes information about the device(s) you use to access the websites including unique device identifiers, IP address, operating system, browser, and cookies. Depending on your device settings, we may also collect information about your geographical location. A list of cookies is provided at the end of this policy.
We collect data when you:
use Lumio;
create an account or make a purchase;
request support;
register for or participate in an online class, exam, certification, training, webcast or other event;
request information or materials;
participate in surveys or evaluations;
submit questions, comments or crash reports; or
submit content or posts on our forums or other interactive webpages.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use the personally identifiable data we collect solely for the purpose of providing Lumio to you. We may share this data with third-party service providers to provide our services to you. All providers contracted by SMART are contractually bound to keep your personal data secure and use it only for necessary service delivery.
In addition to processing your personal data for the purposes of providing our services and facilitating correspondence, we may also process your data based on legitimate interests/lawful basis. These interests or basis include but are not limited to improving our services, managing our business operations and sending you information about our products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, provided you have opted in or not opted out of receiving such communications.
We do not sell your data, and we do not share personal data with third parties without your informed consent, which is the purpose of this document. We share your information in accordance with this agreement and a list of the third parties we share data with to provide our services to you are detailed below.  Data is not shared between sub-processors unless explicitly stated.
YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to control how your personal information is used. You may have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of personal information we hold about you. You also may have the right to object to or restrict certain types of use of your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact
privacy@smarttech.com
.
Please note that many of these rights are not absolute. In some circumstances, we are not legally required to comply with your request because of relevant legal exemptions.
DATA RETENTION AND DELETION
SMART will only keep personal data for as long as required to provide the service or as required for tax and legal reasons. SMART adheres to an internal document retention policy to ensure this. SMART will respond to customer requests to delete personal data within 30 days.  Users (teachers and students) must contact their school (i.e., our customer) to make this request to SMART on their behalf.
All student and teacher created content stored within a teacher’s account can be deleted by the teacher without contacting SMART.  Customers (not users) may request deletion of their SMART account at any time by e-mailing
privacy@smarttech.com
or contacting our
support department
.  Non-paying accounts are deleted after two (2) years of inactivity.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove the information or continue to provide services following removal of such information, in which case we will let you know why.
RIGHT OF NOTIFICATION
If SMART becomes aware of a personal data breach, it shall without undue delay, and where feasible, no later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the affected customer and the supervisory authority (if it was for data where SMART was the Data Controller) in accordance with Article 33 of the GDPR, unless the data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. SMART’s communication of a breach shall be in clear and plain language and contain a minimum of:
Contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact person,
A description of the nature of the breach,
Likely consequences of the breach,
Advice on steps data subjects can take to protect themselves, and
The measures SMART has taken or proposes to take to address the breach.
DATA SECURITY
SMART's business processes are designed and applied to appropriately safeguard your personal information, having regard to the sensitivity and use of that information. Nevertheless, such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information provided to SMART, and SMART is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such security failures. By using our services, you understand that there is a risk that data and communications, including e-mail and other electronic communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated over the Internet. The foregoing does not affect any liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the security measures applied to collection, use or disclosure of your personal information please contact us at
privacy@smarttech.com
.
If you are using a service that involves third party elements (e.g., embedded videos in your lessons), please review the policies of such third-party service providers as they relate to security and data protection.
ENCRYPTION
We employ a variety of safeguards designed to protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
We use cloud services to provide several state-of-the-art security measures, including the same end-to-end 256-bit TLS encryption used by all major banks to secure your data. We do not store or handle any of your login credentials, including passwords, as these are managed by single-sign-on (SSO) identity providers.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our products and services, our operations, or to meet new legal and regulatory requirements. Any material amendments will be communicated to customers 30 days in advance and become binding once posted online.

Thank you for choosing SMART Notebook
®
collaborative learning software.  This privacy policy is applicable to SMART Notebook
®
and SMART Notebook
®
Plus (collectively, “Notebook software”).   Starting with Version 22 the paid subscription features were renamed as “SMART Notebook Plus”.
This privacy policy for Notebook software forms part of the
Terms
agreed upon between you and SMART.  This policy explains how SMART works with you to protect your information and privacy when using Notebook.
By using Notebook software you are consenting to SMART's collection, retention, use and disclosure of certain information as necessary to provide Notebook to you.  If you do not agree, you must not use Notebook.
Automatic Error Reporting: If an Notebook software encounters an issue, the application automatically sends the following anonymous information to SMART’s sub-processor Sentry.io (located in the United States):
Lesson ID (no PII)
User ID and Session IDs (hashed and salted to maintain anonymity)
Request header (application and version, platform, operating system, browser, language, date and time)
Bread crumbs (last pages visited and links clicked)
Optional User Error Reporting: After automatic error reporting is complete, users are given the option to provide their name, email address, and additional information about the error. Users are also asked if they wish SMART to follow up with them. This optional personal information is stored in Salesforce (located in the United States) and shared with our customer support team.
It is important to remember that
customers
and
users
are two distinct groups:
Typically, a
customer
is an organization (e.g., district, school, company) and not a personally identifiable individual. The identifiable information we require is from the organizational purchaser for transactional purposes.  The customer should not be providing SMART with personally identifiable information unless permissible by law and the customer’s policies.
Our
users
(e.g., teachers using Notebook) are generally not the ones who purchased or setup the account and users are only accessing Notebook because the customer’s administrator has granted them access.  As such, SMART’s exposure to personally identifiable information only comes from how the customer operates when providing e-mail addresses and names of users to SMART and from user created Content.   If you have a concern as a user about your PII you must demand the customer provide only non-identifiable information to SMART and you as a user must only create Content with no PII in it.
Still concerned?
Teachers can use SMART Notebook without signing-in.
Teachers can choose to share their created content in a number of ways that do not require students to sign-in.
You own your data and SMART does not sell it or use it for advertisement purposes.  We use your data to provide Notebook to you.  Data portability and deletion is managed by the customer who can request its deletion at any time.
SMART does not advertise or market to minors.
Optional sign-in and therefore account security, is handled by the world class providers Google and Microsoft.  Both providers support two-step (dual) authentication and enforce strong password creation.  Both providers state you can use their services in compliance with GDPR.
User data is encrypted at rest and in-transit.
What about GDPR, CCPA, and FERPA?
User created Content is not a student or educational record, transcript, gradebook, health or directory information.  Notebook is not a learning management system (LMS).
SMART supports the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and numerous other laws including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  SMART is committed to helping our customers work under these and other stringent regulations and we continue to add in-region solutions.  We currently offer American and European data storage for user created Content and we are satisfied our out-of-region user data processors provide appropriate safeguards for the data they handle.
Remember, SMART only receives information because you provide it; you are the data controller.  In this way, customers and users are obligated to comply with their local laws and are responsible for any obligations they owe to their users with respect to their personally identifiable information.
PRODUCT USER DATA COLLECTED AND PROCESSED

About iQ4
iQ4 is an all-in-one Android™ (a trademark of Google LLC) experience for SMART Board
®
interactive displays by SMART Technologies ULC. You have one-touch access to a full suite of SMART education and third-party applications without connecting to an external computer. These applications include a powerful whiteboard, a built-in web browser, wireless screen sharing, and more. The iQ4 experience provides a simple, fully integrated experience between personal devices and interactive displays.
Upon your SMART Board’s start up you are asked to agree to Google’s Privacy Policy. You are also asked to choose a language and a region (USA or Germany) that will tell your Board where to store your data if you log-in using your SMART account. You do not need to log-in and you may store your data locally on your Board.
Introduction
The following information explains our privacy policy (“Policy”) and practices of SMART Technologies ULC regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. This Policy makes clear what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose it, and how you can help manage it. SMART is devoted to making sure your privacy rights are respected and personal data is collected and used in accordance with the current and applicable privacy and data protection laws.
SMART supports numerous privacy laws including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). SMART is committed to helping our customers work under these and other stringent regulations and we continue to add in-region solutions. We currently offer American and European data storage for user created Content and we are satisfied our out-of-region user data processors provide appropriate safeguards for the data they handle. Our SMART Boards and iQ4 are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Therefore, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) does not apply.
By using iQ4, you are agreeing to this Policy and consenting to SMART's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as necessary for the identified purposes or as otherwise identified herein.
Android
™
The Android operating system is open-source software by Google LLC.  While SMART Boards
®
currently have their updates usually provided by SMART, there are times (GMS certified for example) when Android connects to Google servers directly.  If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to Google services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.  By using Android and Google Play Store you are agreeing to Google’s
terms
and
privacy policy
.
Opting out or removing personal information and data retention
We do not sell your data, and we do not share personal data with third parties without your permission. A list of the third parties we share data to provide our services to you are detailed below. Data is not shared between sub-processors unless explicitly stated.
SMART will only keep personal data for as long as required to provide the service, or as required for tax and legal reasons. SMART adheres to a document retention policy to ensure this. SMART will respond to customer requests to delete personal data within 30 days.
You may request deletion of your SMART account at any time by e-mailing
privacy@smarttech.com
or contacting our
support department
. Inactive accounts are deleted after two (2) years. All data stored locally on iQ can be deleted by you at any time by resetting it to factory settings.
If you would like to request that your personal information be provided to you for your review, be removed from our services, or be updated, please contact
privacy@smarttech.com
. In some cases, we may not be able to remove the information or continue to provide services following removal of such information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Right of Notification
If SMART becomes aware of a personal data breach, it shall without undue delay, and where feasible, no later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the affected customer and the supervisory authority (if it was for data where SMART was the Data Controller) in accordance with Article 33 of the GDPR, unless the data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. SMART’s communication of a breach shall be in clear and plain language and contain a minimum of:
Contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact person,
A description of the nature of the breach,
Likely consequences of the breach,
Advice on steps data subjects can take to protect themselves, and
The measures SMART has taken or proposes to take to address the breach
Data Security
SMART's business processes are designed and applied to appropriately safeguard your personal information, having regard to the sensitivity and use of that information. Nevertheless, such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information provided to SMART, and SMART is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such security failures. By using our services, you understand that there is a risk that data and communications, including e-mail and other electronic communications, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated over the Internet. The foregoing does not affect any liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the security measures applied to collection, use or disclosure of your personal information please contact us.
If you are using a service that involves third-party elements, please review the policies of such third-party service providers as they relate to security and data protection.
Encryption
iQ cloud services uses several state-of-the-art security measures, including the same end-to-end 256-bit TLS encryption used by all major banks. We encrypt all your credentials and separate them from your personally identifiable information. We do not store any of your login credentials, including passwords as these are managed by our single-sign-on (SSO) providers.
Data Types
We collect two types of data, depending on your interaction with us:
“Non-Personal Data” means aggregated non-identifiable information, which may be made available or gathered via your access to and interactions with our services. We are not aware of the identity or other identifiers of the individual from which the Non-Personal Data is collected. The Non-Personal Data being collected may include aggregated usage information, as well as technical information transmitted by your device, such as the type of browser or device, type of operation system, device settings and technical software data, etc.
“Personal Data” or “Personal Information” means individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies a natural person (not a corporation) or may, with reasonable effort, be used to identify a natural person.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Data connected or linked to any Personal Data shall be deemed as Personal Data as long as such connection or linkage exists.
We do not knowingly collect or process any Personal Data constituting or revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning a person's health (“Special Categories of Personal Data”).
It is important to remember that
customers
and
users
are two distinct groups:
Customers
are typically an organization (e.g., district, school, company) and not a personally identifiable individual. The identifiable information we require is from the organizational purchaser for transactional purposes. The customer should not be providing SMART with personally identifiable information unless permissible by law and the customer’s policies.
Users
(e.g., teachers, students) are generally not the ones who purchased or setup the account (i.e., IT administrators) and users are only accessing Lumio because the customer’s administrator has granted them access. As such, SMART’s exposure to personally identifiable information only comes from how the customer operates when providing e-mail addresses and names of users to SMART and from user created Content. If you have a concern as a user about your PII you must demand the customer provide only non-identifiable information to SMART and you as a user must only create Content with no PII in it.
