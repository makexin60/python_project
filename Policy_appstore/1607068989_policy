Privacy Policy
At SalesMachineX.com Ltd, we have always honoured our users’ right to data privacy and protection.
We have never relied on advertising as a revenue stream. We have never served ads to our users.
We do not share or sell any data to any third parties; this means that we have no necessity to collect and process users’ personal information beyond what is required for the functioning of our products.
We already have strong Data Processing Agreements and we are revising them to meet the requirements of the GDPR.
We recognise that the GDPR will help us move towards the highest standards of operations in protecting customer data.
