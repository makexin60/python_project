SINGLE SIGN ON SERVICE.
When a User becomes a registered member of DORNA digital services, a personal, individualized, non-transferable and multiuse ID will be assigned. This personal ID will be managed by DORNA through the service “Single Sign On” service (hereinafter, “SSO”), allowing the User the use and access to all DORNA Channels that have already implemented SSO.
The SSO service will provide a profile with a username and a password (hereinafter called, “Credentials”), which will enable the identification of the registered User and will allow the User to manage the privacy preferences and the information provided at the relevant  section on DORNA Channels (hereinafter “My Profile” section). Some minimum required information will be deemed mandatory in the registration form. Additionally, the SSO service allows the User to provide complementary information which may be required, in order to provide certain services offered by some of the DORNA Channels, with the aim of easing and simplifying the experience, purchase of products or request of services by the User.
Furthermore, the SSO service may be used by the User to register in and use any Partners’ Services (identified in Section 3 above) with the same Credentials, provided that they have already implemented that functionality. User is informed that the use of the SSO service in any of these Partners’ Services is completely voluntary and shall be expressly accepted. There will be no forwarding of personal data to third parties unless the explicit consent is freely given by the User.
When the User expressly elects to use the SSO service to complete information, validate its account on and use any of Partners’ Sites, DORNA will act as an external platform, which based on your request and consent, will load your information to Partners’ Sites registration form/process. The aim of SSO Service is to assist you in your registration process in such Partners’ Sites. Only once the User expressly authorizes to use the SSO service and the information that has already been provided to DORNA to be loaded in the co-owned websites or partners’ sites forms, personal data will be shared by DORNA with those third parties. At this point, the User shall finish the registration process by accepting the specific T&Cs and Privacy Policy of the relevant Partners’ Services  (a new user profile will be created in these websites), as provided in the relevant Privacy Policies.
Additionally, complementary information or data that shall be provided by the User in any registration form or request of service/product of the abovementioned Partners’ Services, beyond the previous information provided to DORNA through the SSO registration form, will be synchronized and loaded in the SSO profile and/or My Profile section.
DORNA shall not be responsible for any privacy policy or data processing of other sites or applications you may visit, including Partners Services or those linked to or advertised on any of the DORNA Channels.
