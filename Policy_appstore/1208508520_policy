We Care About Your Personal Data
As
LF FLORA MEXICO S. de R.L. de C.V.
(“
LolaFlora
”), we prepared this Privacy Policy (“
Policy
”) to inform you about how we handle your personal data as a data controller. This Policy sets out the different ways you interact with us and the types of personal data that we collect and the reasons why we use your personal data. This policy also explains why and whom we will share personal data and the rights/choices you have.
At LolaFlora, we are trying to do our best to serve our customers and sellers to make their LolaFlora experience better. Taking good care of the personal data you share is a hugely important part of this. We want you to be sure and confident that your data is safe and secure with us.
Before informing you in detail, we would like to briefly explain which values we act on while we protect your personal data.
One of our fundamental values is transparency. We consider it our duty to inform you with full transparency how we process your data and for what purposes we use it. If there is a change in this policy, we guarantee that you will be informed first.
We are aware of that your personal data only belongs to you. In this regard, we act carefully and responsive to determine which personal data of yours is to be processed by us. Before we provide our services to you, we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. We delete, anonymize, or destruct your personal data when we no longer need them unless there is a legal obligation for the retention of the personal data.
While our information technology team is developing new projects to provide you with a better experience, they put privacy first and ensure that all the necessary measures have been taken to protect your personal data.
We want you to rely on us that your personal data is in good hands. If there is no legal obligation to force us to share your personal data, or if we do not have a different legal basis for sharing your personal data, we ask for your consent to share your personal data. In order to ensure the safety of your personal data, we sign the necessary privacy agreements with third parties when we needed to share your personal data with them.

To prevent fraud
We want to ensure that our customers shop in a safe environment, in accordance with the laws. That is why we conduct anti-fraud checks. In this way, we want to prevent financial and/or reputational damage as a result of fraud. Fraud prevention is therefore not only in our interest but also in yours.
Because every customer has a customer account, fraud often involves a customer account. Based on our own research, we determine whether fraud has occurred. As part of this research, we carefully examine the payment and purchase details. If there is indeed a scam (suspected), we can cancel the order.
With our anti-fraud checks, we try to find fake orders and detect transactions made with stolen credit cards. At the same time, we are trying to prevent the repeated use of campaign codes. For all these transactions, we examine login information, purchase history and order details on the site.
