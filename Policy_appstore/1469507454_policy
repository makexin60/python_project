We collect your Personal Data and other information to give every User of the Service a safe, optimal and personal user experience. We may use information that we collect for the following purposes:
The publication of your user profile.
A social platform means that you can make contact with other users. We process your data in a unique user profile that will be visible for other users, visitors of the platform and users of some search engines.A User controls the information on his or her profile and can choose whether or not his or her profile is included in public search results (via settings).
The improvements and development of matching results, techniques and other functionalities.
We are specialized in successful matching. Our results are more accurate and more successful as we have more details on our users.
The improvement of platform functionality by analysis and interpretation of user statistics.
We are happy to make use of new techniques to improve and renew our products and services.
Advertising.
Advertising allows us to provide you the rich content available on the Service. Some of our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing elsewhere on the internet (i.e. online behavioral advertising). We believe that such tailored ads are more relevant to you and, therefore, more desirable.We and our partners, including Facebook and Google, use your personal data to tailor ads and possibly even show them to you at the relevant time. For example, if you have installed our App, you might see ads of our products, for example, in your Facebook’s feed. How to opt out or influence personalized advertising iOS:On your iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings,” then “Privacy” and tap “Advertising” to select “Limit Ad Track”. In addition, you can reset your advertising identifier (this also may help you to see less of personalized ads) in the same section. Android:To opt-out of ads on an Android device, simply open the Google Settings app on your mobile phone, tap “Ads” and enable “Opt out of interest-based ads”. In addition, you can reset your advertising identifier in the same section (this also may help you to see less of personalized ads).
The detection of, and protection against fraud, errors and/or criminal behavior and breaches of our code of conduct.
This is necessary in order to be able to offer a secure and a high-performance platform. Although we do not usually read or monitor the messages sent or received by you via the Service, we reserve the right to access and view such messages to detect any fraud or other illegal and undesirable user behavior, perform background checks on users or take any legally required actions. For instance, that may happen if we receive numerous complaints from the users on the content of the messages received from you.
General member management and carrying out our paid services.
By this we mean any action necessary to ensure proper service to our users. We use information to personalize the Service for you, such as to select the payment processor available to you, determine eligibility for promotions, and show you personalized advertisements. Some of the data we receive can, due to their nature, be qualified as "sensitive". Sensitive data is data considering your health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and sexuality. Users are not required to share sensitive Personal Data on their profiles, but they can choose to do so. Sensitive Personal Data will only be processed in function of previous mentioned objectives. During the registration process, the User agrees explicitly to the processing of all of his or her personal data.
