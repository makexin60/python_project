, including any services, features, and content accessible or downloadable from the Site, and (ii) any other CentLab Solutions application, service, or product licensed, downloaded, or otherwise accessed by such users through third-party websites or sources ((i) and (ii) collectively, the “Service”).
Acceptance and Consent
By registering for a user account that enables you to post to the Forums (the “Account”), and/or using the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information by CentLab Solutions in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Service.

CentLab Solutions reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changed or modified version on the Site. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting. The Last Revised date will be updated accordingly.
Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the Service, administer and assist you in managing your Account, and improve your overall experience with the Service. We store and process information in the United States.
Personal Information and Non-Personal Information
CentLab Solutions may collect personal and non-personal information when you use the Service. Personal information specifically identifies an individual (e.g., name, email, phone number). Non-personal information includes data such as browsing activity. Both types of information are referred to as "Your Information" in this policy.
Face Data Collection and Usage
We do not collect or store any face data in the Service. The app does not use facial recognition technologies, nor does it process or retain any facial information from users. No sensitive biometric data is collected, shared, or processed by our app. This includes face data in photos, videos, or any other content provided by users.
​
App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and User Tracking Disclosure
Tracking Disclosure
In compliance with Apple’s [App Store Connect Privacy Guidelines](
https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/manage-app-privacy),
we disclose that our app tracks users for analytics, advertising, or marketing purposes. This includes collecting data used to track the user across apps and websites owned by third parties.
​
App Tracking Transparency Implementation
In accordance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy, we have implemented a system that requests user consent before any tracking activities begin. This consent prompt is required under Apple’s guidelines and ensures transparency with our users.
​​
Requesting User Permission for Tracking
Before collecting any data used for tracking purposes, we request explicit permission from users through Apple's ATT framework. This prompt is presented when the app is first launched or when accessing specific features that involve tracking. Users can choose to allow or disallow tracking within the prompt. When resubmitting the app, the Review Notes will indicate where the permission request is located.
​
Use of Account
When you register for an Account, we may collect Your Information, such as your email address, to help administer your Account. You can control what information is shared within your Account settings.
Use of Applications
When you launch any of our applications, we collect certain device-specific information to ensure proper functionality and improve the user experience. However, no face data or biometric information is collected or used.
Log Data, Cookies, and Web Beacons
We use cookies and web beacons to monitor the Service's performance and user behavior. However, these tracking tools do not collect any personal information like face data.
Retention of Data
As previously mentioned, our app does not collect or store face data, so no such data is retained. All other information collected is retained only for as long as necessary to provide and improve the Service or comply with legal obligations.
Sharing Your Information
We may share Your Information with third parties that assist in providing the Service. However, no face data is shared with any third parties, as none is collected.
Security
We take reasonable steps to protect Your Information from unauthorized access. However, since no face data is collected, this specific sensitive information does not pose any security risks in our Service.
Third-Party Links
Our Service may contain links to third-party websites, but this Privacy Policy does not apply to them.
International Users
If you are located outside the United States, Your Information is transferred to and processed in the United States.
