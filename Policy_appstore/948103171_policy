Privacy Policy
Rooms is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection of any information you share with us.
Use of Personal Information
When you register for a Rooms account (optional) we ask only for a valid email address.
Information will be shared, only as necessary, in order to investigate, prevent, or take action against fraud or suspected illegal activities. 
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
You will be notified before any personal information is transfered in the event of an acquisition or merger.
Client Data and Storage
When you register for a Room account (optional), all client data submitted during use of Rooms's services will be securely kept on Rooms's hosted servers. This data will not be used in any way other than to provide Rooms's services. Although Rooms owns the data storage, databases and all rights to the Rooms application, you retain all rights to your data. 
You have the ability within the Rooms app to delete your account at any time, which will remove all of your data from the Rooms server.
