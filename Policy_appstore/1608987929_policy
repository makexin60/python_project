The Company does not knowingly collect data from persons under the age of 18 and such persons are not allowed to use the Company Apps and doing so is a breach of the Terms of Use. If you believe we have information regarding or relating to your child you may also make a request to know or delete on behalf of your child by emailing
legal@triumpharcade.com
.
You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:
A government issued identification number.
Responding to a one-time code sent to the mobile device associated with the account.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete.
We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it.
For instructions on exercising your sale opt-out or opt-in rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.
Response Timing and Format
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact both
legal@triumpharcade.com
and
help@triumpharcade.com
.
We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are age 18 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know are less than 18 years old as such users are not authorized to use the Company Apps and, if found are removed from the system. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. If you believe we have obtained information from a person under the age of 18 please contact
legal@triumpharcade.com
.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us through the Triumph Application by going to the “Settings” tab under your profile page and clicking “Do Not Sell”. You may also email
legal@triumpharcade.com
with your name, phone number, and profile name with the subject of the email “Do Not Sell”.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by changing your Opt-Out preference to Opt-In.
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights, if you do not have an account you can email
legal@triumpharcade.com
with the subject line “Opt-Out Request” with the body of the email including your legal name, phone number, and email address. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that
can result
in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time. At this time we do not offer different incentive structures.
