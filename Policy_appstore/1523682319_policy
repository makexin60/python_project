Widgetsmith
Privacy Policy & Terms
I take your privacy very seriously.  I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. To that end I’ve designed Widgetsmith from the ground up to ensure that your data stays completely private.
Widgetsmith can optionally access a variety of your personal data for display
within
the app.  This includes your health data, your calendar data, your reminders, your photos and your location data.  All of this access is handled using the standard iOS/watchOS privacy prompts.  If you give Widgetsmith access to this data it will be read and displayed only within the app, with the following exceptions:
A GPS coordinate (either provided by your search or current location) is necessarily sent along with any weather data requests.  This goes to Apple Weather and is governed by their
privacy policy
.
A GPS coordinate (either provided by your search or current location) is necessarily sent along with any tide data requests.  This goes to WorldTides and is governed by their
privacy policy
.
A GPS coordinate (either provided by your search or current location) is necessarily sent along with any Air Quality and Pollen data requests.  This goes to Breezometer and is governed by their
privacy policy
.
Other than these cases, no personal data ever leaves your devices.  Unless you email me for support, I will have no information about you or what you do within the app.
I don’t want the responsibility of managing your data correctly, so I don’t collect it, which I think is better for both of us.
If you sign-up for a Widgetsmith Premium subscription, additional non-personally identifiable data will be kept.  Your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the App Store and are not visible to me.  I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire.  This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion.  This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider (
RevenueCat
).
For non-subscribers Widgetsmith may display advertisements within the application.  These are managed by Google’s AdMob system.  I have configured my advertising to minimize the privacy considerations often inherit with advertising.  I don’t show personalized ads within the app.  Additionally, I have disabled all of Google’s user tracking and analytics capabilities for ads shown within Widgetsmith.  You can read more about Google’s Privacy policies

(Now for the legal boilerplate part of the Privacy Policy. I always prefer to start with plain English before I get into that part of things.)
Email Newsletter
By signing up for the optional Widgetsmith email list, you are providing your first name, last name and email address. This data will be used to send occasional promotional emails. You can opt out of these emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of these emails. SendGrid Analytics are used to track the open and click-through rate of these emails. None of your personal data is used for any uses other than associated with these marketing messages.
Personally-Identifying Information
Widgetsmith does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences about the user interface within its local database.
Business Transfers
If Widgetsmith, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Widgetsmith goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As Widgetsmith does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Widgetsmith may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Widgetsmith’s sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
Indemnity
You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.

If you allow Weather to access your location, your location will be sent to Apple to provide relevant weather forecasts. Your location is not associated with your identity.
If you request a forecast for a location you follow, that information will be sent to Apple to provide a forecast for that location. This is not associated with your identity.
If you enable severe weather notifications, Apple can associate the region of such notifications with your Apple Account.
Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better. When we do collect data we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Weather, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.
To understand and improve the Weather app, Apple collects limited information about the first time you launch the app in a day. This information is not linked to your identity.
If you allow Weather to access your location, your location will be sent to Apple to provide relevant weather forecasts. If you request a forecast for a location you follow, that information will be sent to Apple to provide a forecast for that location. Additionally, Weather will access your Home and Work locations, where available, to label these locations in the app. You can use My Card in the Contacts app to update your home and work addresses. You can also turn these labels off at any time. On your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Apps > Weather, then tap to turn off Home and Work. On Mac, go to Weather > Settings > General and deselect Home and Work. The information Apple collects to provide forecasts is not linked to your identity.
If you choose to enable severe weather notifications, where available, Weather corresponds each location where you have enabled such notifications with a region. A region may be a country, or for some countries (such as the U.S. and Canada), a region may be an area with at least 500,000 residents. The list of regions for which you have enabled such notifications will be sent to Apple and can be associated with your Apple Account. Apple uses the list of regions to enable this feature and deliver the notifications to your device. Weather filters the regional notifications on your device based on the specific locations for which you have enabled severe weather notifications in order to deliver the relevant notifications to you.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy

        services and enhance your experience with them).
HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
Security
. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to protect your personal data. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the
            information will not be compromised as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the
            security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect this information.
Retention of your Personal Data
. In addition to the retention periods mentioned above, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time, for example (i)
            where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we
            reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings. We have an internal data retention policy to ensure that we do not retain your Personal Data perpetually. Regarding retention of cookies,
            you can read more in our
cookie policy
.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
In addition to the recipients described above, we may share your Personal Data as follows:
With our business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services. We may also share Personal Data with our affiliated companies.
To the extent necessary, with regulators, courts or competent authorities, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules (including, without limitation, federal, state or local laws), and requests of law enforcement, regulatory
            and other governmental agencies or if required to do so by court order;
If, in the future, we sell or transfer, or we consider selling or transferring, some or all of our business, shares or assets to a third party, we will disclose your Personal Data to such third party (whether actual or potential) in
            connection with the foregoing events;
In the event that we are acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer, disclose or assign your Personal Data in connection with the foregoing
            events; and/or

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
Storage:
We store our data in Hubspot CRM. The HubSpot platform is hosted in data center providers in the US - Amazon Web Services in the US-East-1 region. Google Cloud Platform- data
            stored here is located in the US.
Internal transfers:
Transfers within the Breezometer Group will be covered by an internal processing agreement entered into by members of the Breezometer Group (an intra-group agreement)
            which contractually obliges each member to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred to.
External transfers:
Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Union (including the European Economic Area) (“EU”), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (for example to
            third parties who provide us with services), we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. When we engage in such transfers of personal information, we may rely on i) Adequacy Decisions as adopted by
            European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) (for example, when we access from Israel), ii) the Data Privacy Framework described below, or iii) Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European
            Commission. We also continually monitor the circumstances surrounding such transfers in order to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by applicable law, such
            as the GDPR.
Data Privacy Framework:
As described in our parent company Google LLC’s
Data Privacy Framework certification
, we comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension
            to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework” or “DPF”), as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
            received in the U.S. from the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF. Google LLC and its wholly owned US subsidiaries has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles. Breezometer
            remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the “How We Share Your Personal
            Data” section. To learn more about the DPF certification program, and to view our parent company Google LLC’s certification, please visit the
Data Privacy Framework website

. Google is subject to the
            investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority, and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the
            Data Privacy Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the
Data Privacy Framework Principles
