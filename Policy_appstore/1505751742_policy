How Long We Keep Your Personal Information
As stated earlier in this Policy, we will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Where it is no longer necessary to retain your Personal Information, we will securely delete, or in some circumstances, anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further statement to you. Any such anonymization would be performed in accordance with, and where allowed by, applicable law.
Your California Privacy Rights
As a California resident, you have rights in relation to your Personal Information; however, your rights are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we cannot disclose specific pieces of Personal Information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the Personal Information, your account with us or the security of our network systems.
Right Against Discrimination – You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your right to know, delete or opt-out of sales.
Right to Know – You have the right to request in writing: (i) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, email address, that a business has disclosed to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and (ii) the names and addresses of all such third parties. In addition, you have the right to request: (i) the categories of personal information we have collected about you, (ii) the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, (iii) the business or commercial purpose for the information collection, (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal information, and (v) the specific pieces of personal information we hold about an individual. You have the right to request a copy of the specific Personal Information we collected about you during the 12 months before your request.
Right to Delete – You have the right to request us delete any Personal Information we have collected from you or maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to Correct – Effective beginning January 1, 2023, if you believe that any of the personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, under the CPRA you may submit a request for us to correct that information. Upon receipt of a verifiable request to correct inaccurate personal information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the information as you direct.
Right to Limit the Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information – Effective beginning January 1, 2023, you may direct us to limit the use of your sensitive Personal Information to uses that are reasonably necessary to provide our goods and services, or as needed; to ensure security and integrity; for short-term, transient use, including for non-personalized advertising; to maintain or service accounts, provide customer service, process or fulfill orders and transactions, verify customer information, process payments, provide financing, provide analytic services, provide storage, or other similar services; and to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance such services or devices.
To assert your right to know, delete, or correct your Personal Information or to limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information or for any other questions or concerns, please contact us by emailing us at
privacy@hornblower.com
or calling us toll-free at 833-311-0971.
When making a request regarding your privacy rights, we may ask you to verify your identity. To do so, we may ask you to verify Personal Information we already have on file about you. If we cannot verify your identity from the information we have on file, we may request additional information from you, which we will only use to verify your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. If you exercise your right to request specific pieces of your personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
Right to Opt-Out of Selling or Sharing of Your Personal Information– The CCPA broadly defines “personal information” and “selling” such that sharing identifiers and identifiers linked to you for a benefit may be considered a sale. You have the right to opt-out of having your Personal Information sold as defined in the CCPA. We do not sell your Personal Information. However, we do “share” Personal Information collected by cookies such as IP address to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. To opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information for this purpose, please refer to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled, “You can control cookies and tracking tools” or visit our

1. MARKETING
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain uses of your Personal Information, particularly around marketing.
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, Geolocation and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us, purchased goods or services from us, consented to receiving such communications or where we are pursuing a legitimate interest and have a lawful right to do so and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in this way or to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes, please click an unsubscribe link in your emails or emailing us at
privacy@hornblower.com
. You can object to direct marketing at any time and free of charge.
2.
OPTING OUT
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by   clicking on an unsubscribe link in your emails or emailing us at
privacy@hornblower.com
at any time.
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Information provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, service experience or other transactions.
3.
DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
To provide services and effectively run our business, we may need to share your Personal Information as permitted by law. We may share your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients:
Other companies within the Hornblower Group Family of Companies;
Service providers (which may include “service providers” as that term is defined under the General Data Protection Regulation, including IT and system administration services and recruitment agencies;
Third party ticket providers who are entities outside the Hornblower Group Family of Companies (“Ticket Providers”), but from whom you purchased services from our Sites.
Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers;
Regulators and other authorities where required by law;
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners are permitted to use your Personal Information in the same way as set out in this privacy statement.
We require all group companies and third party Service Providers to respect the security of your Personal Information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third party Service Providers to use your Personal Information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.  Your personal data is subject a Ticket Provider’s privacy policies once the data is transferred.
We do not sell the Personal Information we collect about you. We may, however, share your Personal Information with group companies, service providers, or third parties in accordance with the business purposes set out in this privacy statement.
4.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Hornblower Group is headquartered in the United States and the Sites are hosted in the United States. As a result, if you are located in Europe or the United Kingdom your Personal Information may be transferred outside Europe.
Personal Information that is voluntarily provided to us may be maintained or accessed in servers or files located in the United States, which some or all of the Designated Countries have not deemed to provide “adequate” privacy safeguards. If you do not consent to having your Personal Information processed and stored in the United States, please do not provide it to us. By voluntarily providing your Personal Information on or via the Sites, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States.
Some of our third party service providers and group companies are based outside the Designated Countries so their processing of your Personal Information will also involve a transfer of data outside the Designated Countries.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Information out of the Designated Countries, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission.
Where we use certain providers or transfer data between the Hornblower Group Family of Companies, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Information the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see:
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en
for the EU,
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/
for the UK, and https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/datenschutz/arbeit_wirtschaft/datenuebermittlung_ausland.html for Switzerland.
Please contact us at the details set out above if you are located in Europe and want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring Personal Information out of Europe.
5.
DATA SECURITY
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
6.
DATA RETENTION
As stated earlier in this Policy, we will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Where it is no longer necessary to retain your Personal Information, we will securely delete, or in some circumstances, anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further statement to you. Any such anonymization would be performed in accordance with, and where allowed by, applicable law.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
7.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF THE DESIGNATED COUNTRIES
If you are located in the Designated Countries, under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. These rights include:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”): this enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you: this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information: this enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
You have the right not to be subject to automatic decision-making, including profiling. We sometimes use our computers and technology to study your personal information. This helps us to use this information so we know how you use our services, and make suggestions and recommendations to you about goods or services that may be of interest to you.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:
(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at
privacy@hornblower.com
.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
The Australian Privacy Policy (“Australian Policy”) supplements the above Standard Privacy Policy and only applies to the management of personal information collected in Australia.
We will manage personal Information that is subject to the Australian Policy in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) set out in the
Privacy Act 1988
(Cth) (“Privacy Act”).
For the purposes of the Australian Policy,
“Personal Information” means any information or an opinion about an identified individual, or individual who is reasonably identifiable.
“Sensitive Information” means any personal information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record or health information.
Unless otherwise stated, all other capitalized terms in the Australian Policy have the meaning set out in the Standard Privacy Policy.
Sensitive Information
We will not ask you to disclose sensitive information (other than health information) to us. If sensitive information (other than health information) is disclosed to us, we will take reasonable steps to de-identify the data or destroy it where we can. Otherwise, Sensitive Personal Information will be dealt with in accordance with the Standard Privacy Policy.
We may collect information about your health, where necessary for safety reasons, to facilitate provision of your access to our products and services, and for insurance purposes. Specifically, we may collect data about:
o          Any health conditions you have;
o          Your Covid-19 vaccination status; and
o          Your dietary requirements.
Security of information
The security of your information is very important to us. We regularly review developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as totally secure.
We take all reasonable steps to protect the information in our systems from misuse, interference, loss, and any unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. If we no longer require your information, and we are legally permitted to, we will take all reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information.
We take reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information in accordance with the Australian Policy. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (unencrypted).
Overseas recipients
Some personal information may be transferred to countries outside of Australia in the course of our business. We may share Personal Information overseas for reasons including where we have engaged a service provider or a member of the Hornblower Group Family of Companies to assist us with certain technology or data storage functions.
Your Personal Information may be shared with parties located overseas, including in the following countries, and other countries from time to time:
Australia;
the United States;
Canada;
the European Union;
the United Kingdom;
Switzerland;
Singapore; and
India
When we disclose Personal Information outside of Australia, we will comply with this Australian Policy and the Privacy Act.
If you do not agree to the transfer of your personal information outside of Australia, please contact us. In these circumstances, we may be prevented from providing products or services to you.
How do we hold your personal information?
All Personal Information held by us will be handled and stored in accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Act.  We will take reasonable steps to:
implement practices, procedures and systems in our business that will ensure compliance with our legal obligations and to deal with inquiries or complaints about compliance with our legal obligations;
make sure that the Personal Information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date;
protect the information from misuse, interference, loss or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure both physically and through security methods; and
destroy or permanently de-identify the information if it is no longer needed for any purpose.
Please notify us promptly if you become aware of any breach of security.  We will comply with all mandatory notification requirements in respect of security breaches as required by the Privacy Act.
Access your personal information
You are entitled to request access to any of the Personal Information we hold about you.
If you would like to request access to your Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right of data portability is provided to you by applicable law), please contact us at:
Email:
privacy@hornblower.com
You will not be charged for making a request to access your Personal Information, but to the extent permitted by law, you may be charged for the reasonable time and expense incurred in compiling information in response to your request.
For your protection we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will comply with your request within a reasonable period after you make your request.
