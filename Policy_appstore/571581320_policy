Seabreeze.com.au Privacy Policy
Seabreeze.com.au is committed to gaining & retaining your trust.
General
Seabreeze.com.au offers pages where you can enter personal information, such as when
            you register, or buy from the Seabreeze Shop.    We will also collect information about what pages
            you have looked at for the purposes of counting which pages are important to all our users.
When you register we may ask for information such as your email address.  For shipping products to you, we will ask for your name, address and phone number.
Seabreeze.com.au receives and records information from your browser,
            including your IP address, cookie information (to remember you’re logged in, or your choice of arrow
            colours), what kind of browser/machine you’re using (so we can work on testing mobile and/or desktop enhancements), and of
            course, the page you request, so we can understand how you use the site.
Seabreeze.com.au may use this information to customize the advertising
            and content you see (e.g. if you kite, we'll show kite adverts, not wedding photographers), to fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you,
            conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting and how people like to use the site.
Information Sharing & Disclosure
Seabreeze.com.au does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with
            other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when
            we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
When showing your classifieds, if you've entered a phone number and a name, we will display it so
        that potential buyers can contact you.  We will forward emails to/from you privately, and won't reveal your email, although you
        can choose to, yourself..
We provide anonymised information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with
            Seabreeze.com.au under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use this personal information to help
            Seabreeze.com.au communicate with you about offers from Seabreeze.com.au and our marketing partners.
            However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (such as law enforcement
            requests), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to view & share information in order to investigate,
            prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
            threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Seabreeze.com.au's terms of use, or as
            otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Seabreeze.com.au is acquired by or merged with
            another company.
Seabreeze.com.au may display targeted advertisements based on personal information.
            Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click
            targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic
            area.
Seabreeze.com.au does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you
            interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the
            possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to
            display the ad.
Cookies & Similar Technologies
Seabreeze.com.au lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages
            read and write cookies in the browser. Other companies' use of their cookies and device
            identifiers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not
            have access to Seabreeze.com.au's cookies.

1. What does Publift do?
Publift is a programmatic advertising platform.  Through the provision of its
Fuse Platform
(comprised of the "Fuse Tag"), it provides Publishers with access to a variety of advertising services (including provided via third parties) by packaging them up into a single piece of code.  In particular, the Fuse Tag facilitates the collection of information from devices of users visiting Publisher properties by both Publift and its third party advertising partners, such as ad networks.  This enables Publishers to sell advertising space on their digital properties and to optimise their advertising opportunities. Publift is headquartered in Australia but services Publishers all around the world. For more information about Publift, please see the "

Joint controllership with Data Partners.
Please note that, Publift acts as a joint controller (with some of its Data Partners and Publishers) in facilitating the collection and transmission of Device Data and Bid Request Data to Data Partners.

However, neither Publift, nor its Publishers, have any influence over the subsequent processing of Device Data and Bid Request Data by Data Partners. This subsequent processing will be carried out by Data Partners in accordance with the terms of their respective Privacy Notices and the preferences you indicate via the consent management platform displayed to you via Publisher web properties.

6. Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, "
Cookies
") to collect and use personal data about you via the Fuse Tag, including to serve interest based advertising.  For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our
Cookie Notice
.
7. International data transfers
In some cases, your personal data will be processed by Publift in countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our servers are located worldwide, and we have offices in Sydney, Dublin, Melbourne and San Francisco.  Our third party service providers and Data Partners also operate around the world including in Australia, the European Economic Area, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Brazil, Japan, India, Philippines, Indonesia, China, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Turkey, South Korea, Israel and the Middle East.  This means that when we collect your personal data, we may process it in any of these countries.
Where we transfer your personal data to countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, we rely on the relevant "adequacy decisions" from the European Commission and "adequacy regulations" (data bridges) from the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom.
Where we transfer your personal data to a territory that outside of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom that is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws. The safeguards we may use to transfer personal data are, in the case of both our group companies and third party service providers and Data Partners, the
European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) using module(s) for controller to controller and controller to processor transfers, including the UK Addendum and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement permitted under Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR for the transfer of data originating in the United Kingdom.
Should you have any questions about international transfers of your personal data, or the safeguards that we use, please contact us using the contact details under the “
How to contact us
” heading below.
8. Data retention
We retain the personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended and your Fuse Platform user account has been deleted. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. For example:  We keep your information when we have a legal obligation to do so (for example if a court order is received about your account, we would retain your data for longer than the usual retention period when an account is deleted); to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (for example, if there is an ongoing complaint with respect to the Fuse Tag service), to protect individuals' rights and property (for example we may retain information about a data subject access request for a period after the request is dealt with in case there is a subsequent complaint and the information is needed to demonstrate how the request was handled) and for litigation or regulatory matters (for example we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim. This information would be retained until the legal claim had been concluded).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
9. Your data protection rights
Individuals located in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area have the following data protection rights. To exercise any of your data protection rights if you are located in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, see specific instructions below or contact us using the contact details provided under the "

opt-out of marketing communications
we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing e-mails we send you.  To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), please contact us using the contact details provided under the "
How to contact us

If we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time by using the contact details provided under the "
How to contact us
" heading below.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to complain to a supervisory authority
about our collection and use of your personal data.  For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. Contact details for supervisory authorities in Europe are available

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Generally, there will be no charge for this service, however you may be required to verify your identity before any information is released to you. Depending on the volume, type or method of access to the information you request, Publift may charge you some fees, however, these will not be excessive, will be notified in advance, and will not apply to the making of the request. Please note that depending on the volume or nature of the information required, it may take a number of days to fulfil the request.  Publift may destroy or de-identify personal data once the data is no longer deemed required by the business or by applicable laws.
You may deal with Publift anonymously by using a pseudonym, unless Publift is reasonably required or authorised by law to deal only with an identified person, or it is reasonably impracticable for us to respond to you if you have not identified yourself.
If you are in a location other than the United Kingdom and European Economic Area, you may have certain data protection rights. If you have a problem or request about your personal information or wish to enquire about your privacy, please submit a request
here

Seabreeze.com.au Privacy Policy
General
Seabreeze.com.au offers pages where you can enter personal information, such as when you register, or buy from the Seabreeze Shop. We will also collect information about what pages you have looked at for the purposes of counting which pages are important to all our users.
When you register we may ask for information such as your email address. For shipping products to you, we will ask for your name, address and phone number.
Seabreeze.com.au receives and records information from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information (to remember you're logged in, or your choice of arrow colours), what kind of browser/machine you're using (so we can work on testing mobile and/or desktop enhancements), and of course, the page you request, so we can understand how you use the site.
Seabreeze.com.au may use this information to customize the advertising and content you see (e.g. if you kite, we'll show kite adverts, not wedding photographers), to fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting and how people like to use the site.
Information Sharing & Disclosure
Seabreeze.com.au does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
When showing your classifieds, if you've entered a phone number and a name, we will display it so that potential buyers can contact you. We will forward emails to/from you privately, and won't reveal your email, although you can choose to, yourself..
We provide anonymised information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Seabreeze.com.au under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use this personal information to help Seabreeze.com.au communicate with you about offers from Seabreeze.com.au and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (such as law enforcement requests), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to view & share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Seabreeze.com.au's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Seabreeze.com.au is acquired by or merged with another company.

Seabreeze.com.au does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
