No Obligation to Provide Personal Data
In general: the provision of your personal data is voluntary. You are neither legally nor contractually obliged to do so. Ivanti does not contractually oblige you to provide Ivanti with personal data.
Many Ivanti products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide the personal data necessary for Ivanti to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature and Ivanti may need to suspend or cancel it. Likewise, where Ivanti needs personal data to enter or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the personal data, Ivanti will not be able to enter, or perform under, the contract. Where providing personal data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such personal data will not work.
Data Collected from You
Ivanti automatically collects statistical data that may include personal data when you use Ivanti products. Ivanti also collects personal data when you ask for or consent to receive products or marketing materials from Ivanti. Ivanti may associate that data with personal data Ivanti collects in other ways or receive from third parties. The data Ivanti collects depends on the context of your interactions with Ivanti and the choices you make, including your privacy settings, email subscription settings, and the products and features you use. Ivanti processes personal data in a manner that is compatible with the initial purpose of the personal data collection.
When you use Ivanti products, you provide Ivanti with personal data that may include the following:

Metadata and other information
. Ivanti may collect metadata and other information to analyze and benchmark your use of Ivanti products. Ivanti may use that information to generate reports, analyze product usage, administer, and improve the products, both for your individual use and Ivanti’s user base. Ivanti may also use the information to improve or create new products and to make recommendations to you and other Ivanti customers about how to better use Ivanti products and services.

. Ivanti’s websites gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, browser language, device identifier, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, duration of visit, pages viewed, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, crashes, system activity, hardware settings, the date and time of requests and other usage data.

. If you contact Ivanti over the telephone or via facsimile, Ivanti may also log information such as your phone number, forwarding calls, SMS routing information, and types of calls.
Data We Process on Behalf of our Business Customers
. Data Ivanti collects through Ivanti products under the direction of its business customers shall be limited to such data necessary for the purpose of providing the product and for purposes identified in the contract between Ivanti’s business customer and Ivanti.
