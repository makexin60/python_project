Third Parties to Whom We Disclose Your Personal Information
We disclose the personal information you provide or that we collect in some circumstances to the following third parties:
7.1.
Advertisers, Advertising Networks and Data Analytics Companies.
We share your personal information with advertisers, third-party advertising networks and analytics companies who use it to deliver targeted advertisements to you on the Services or third-party websites or advertisers. Similarly, these advertisers share personal information with us about you that they have independently gathered or acquired. We also share the personal information we have collected in order to enable our advertising partners to perform data analysis or for advertising-related use. That personal information is always encrypted except cookie IDs.
7.2.
Cooperative Database and Marketing Companies
These companies provide what is called a “cooperative database”, which is a type of database that holds information about customers and their transaction histories through which many companies, such as ours, will contribute information to the database in return for aggregate information on the customers other companies have provided. None of the companies that participate in these cooperative databases reveal which company has collected that data, so none of the participating companies are able to identify which company the data is associated with. Each email and mailing address is then associated with specific business categories (e.g., home decor, artwork, etc.) based on customers’ transaction histories. The participating companies, like ours, are then able to process, using data mining and other marketing targeting techniques, the email and mailing addresses in relation to the specific business categories they want to target in their direct mailing. Such databases are generally used for promotional mailings, credit card fraud detection, digital media targeting, business intelligence or fighting e-mail spam. In our case, these databases are used for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns: this means that, from time to time, we share our customers’ email and mailing addresses and related transactional information, such as your purchase history, amounts paid and products ordered, with cooperative database and marketing companies for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns. These types of marketing campaigns are mainly carried out in relation with our Saatchiart.com and Society6.com websites. Some of the third-party vendors who receive your personal information from us may resell it for their own direct marketing purposes, and the direct marketing purposes of other third-party marketing companies.
If you prefer to opt-out of the use of your email and mailing addresses for the above purposes, please let us know at
privacy@saatchiart.com
.
7.3.

will only have access to the personal information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.
7.4.

Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user personal information will be subject to this Privacy Notice. However, any personal information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy notice adopted by the successor entity or acquirer, as applicable.

Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
