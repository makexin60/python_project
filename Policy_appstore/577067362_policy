WALKME does not use its own cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified.
We also use third party cookies, Google Analytics and Google AdSense
Third parties advertising on the Website could use cookies or ‘web beacons’ for which WALKME would not be responsible and which would not be governed by this Privacy Policy, so it is the responsibility of the user to set the options in his/her browser in order that cookies are only used according to his/her own preferences.

Even though WALKME does not and will not attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility). Consequently, according to the applicable data protection law, this Privacy Policy will apply.
