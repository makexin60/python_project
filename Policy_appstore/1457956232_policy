“I absolutely love this app. I have lost three stone in weight and am on track to being fitter and healthier. Shielding has not stopped me. I may look crazy walking up and down the path in the garden, but once I am allowed to safely go out, I am going to be five stone lighter, size 8-10 clothes and confident in strutting my stuff, all thanks to WalkFit, and a good mindset and eating habits and mindset.”
“At first I did not think it was what I wanted, but after understanding what WalkFit had on offer I got hooked.”
“Great way to track activities. Even a small number of steps helps me keep active!”
