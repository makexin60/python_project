The minimum information we collect from you is your name, email address and telephone number. We may also collect additional information about you to enrich your CPD portfolio, which is optional to you as an end user. This includes your postal address, job title, employer, interests, communication preferences, qualifications and work history.
Our system provides you with the ability to add a CPD diary or reflective entry within your own profile for the purposes of capturing a full CPD record of your personal development. This information, along with any attached files, is stored securely within your profile.
The CPD Dashboard and the Mobile Apps will allow you to capture and
upload evidence
such as:
Videos
Audio
Images
Text
Files
PDFs
Word Documents
And other information and media to support your CPD Portfolio Building.
Webinars, Events and Conferences
In attending one of our webinars or events, we will ask you to provide your name, email address and contact preferences. This will enable us to identify participants for the purpose of issuing event tickets, printing of event badges and sending you any CPD certificates of attendance.
We will only store your information on our contacts database if it is selected within your contact preferences when signing up for an event. This will enable us to send you useful information relating to special offers, upcoming webinars and new product features.
We do not store your financial information or payment methods. These details are held and governed by third party banking organisations including Stripe, Paypal Business and GoGardless limited.
Why do we collect your information?
We only use your information in accordance with the law.  This gives us various powers to use your data.  These are effectively the reasons for our process and are:
To perform or take steps to enter a contract with you.
For the purposes of our legitimate interests: This includes being able to send you marketing.
Compliance with a legal obligation.
If you consent to us to do so.
​​​​​​​
Collecting and using your data will mean we are able to manage your membership, process any orders or requests you have and to provide you with relevant and topical information relating to your interests.  For example, changes to our services.  It will enable us to ask for your views on our services and matters relating to your CPD.
​
Data protection applies to personal data held about individuals.  It does not always cover ‘business to business’ contacts or information.  However, we will also do our best to secure and protect the contact details of our corporate contacts.
Who has access to your information?
Staff of CPDme will have controlled access to your information to enable us to provide you with services and support.  Volunteers of CPDme will not receive access to your personal information without your consent or, very occasionally, in defined circumstances under the direct supervision of full time employed CPDme staff.
We will not sell or rent your information to third parties.  We will not share your information with third parties for them to market to you.  We may pass your information to our third-party service providers, subcontractors and other associated organisations to provide services on our behalf (for example, to send you certificates). However, when we use third parties, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we require them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes or retain it for a period beyond our commissioned service provision.
Members wishing to access the benefits associated with being employed by a group membership scheme or corporate membership package can do so by agreeing that their personal profile is shared with that corporate membership partner.

In relation to data recovery, each submission you send to CPDme using the diary and reflective forms are backed up several times during submission. This is by the website, the form building software and our cloud server. This ensures that we never lose any of your entries.
