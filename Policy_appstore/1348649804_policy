REQUESTS
To submit a verifiable consumer request for access, portability or
            deletion personal data please contact us through the
[contact form]
.
            Please include in the text of your appeal the wording "Your rights
            to maintain confidentiality in the state of California”.
When submitting a verifiable request, you should be ready to:
• Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative, which may include: name, address,
            city, state, and zip code and email address. We may use this
            information to surface a series of security questions to you to
            verify your identity. If you are making a request through an
            authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must
            provide written authorization confirming or a power of attorney,
            signed by you.
• Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not be able to respond to your request or provide you with
            personal information if we cannot: (i) verify your identity or
            authority to make the request; or (ii) confirm the personal
            information relates to you. We may ask you for additional
            information or documents to verify your identity. We may also carry
            out checks, including with third party identity verification
            services, to verify your identity before taking any action with your
            personal information. This is regarded as a safeguard measure to
            prevent disclosure of your personal information under a fake or scum
            request.
We ensure that personal information provided in a verifiable
            consumer request will be used only to verify the requestor’s
            identity or authority to make the request and not for any other
            purpose. We will keep it for the adequate term reasonably needed for
            the purpose described above and delete after the purpose is
            fulfilled.
We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five
            (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform
            you of the reason and extension period in writing. Please note that
            we are only required to respond to two requests per customer each
            year.
EQUAL RIGHTS
Nothing in the way we deal with your request shall be interpreted as
            discrimination, which means that we will not set up different
            pricing or products, or different level or quality of services for
            you, if you choose to exercise your rights. However, in some
            circumstances, we may not be able to provide services if you choose
            to delete your personal information from our records.

            use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate
performance of the contract

              username and photo, geolocation data, place names and addresses,
              added by you. We process your traffic and location data
              automatically through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation

              You can learn more about privacy and Opt-out options here:
              https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033. If you turn off location
              sharing we will not share your location with your selected friends
              and family members.  Upon your consent we also may have
              technical access to the camera roll on your device.
We process this information by ourselves. However, we may also
            engage third parties - Amazon.com - for storing this personal data
            in order to fulfill obligations and deliver the full scope of
            services. This personal data can be deleted either by these third
            parties in accordance with our instructions or by our own means.
Activity Information
(list of selected friends
              and family members, detailed location history, battery status)
              directly related to your use of the App. After you set the
              relevant settings on your device we may have technical access to
              your contact list - in order to be able to match contact details.
              However, we cannot collect, store or use the data contained in
              your contact list or camera roll.
All files that might be processed are stored locally on your device
            and/or in your iCloud storage, they are inaccessible to us. Only you
            can share files to certain party by exporting them through the App.
Contact Information

              well as any other content included in the email) which you may
              fill in by yourself when you contact us via email, support form.
              We collect, store and process it by our cloud storage provider
              (Amazon.com, Inc.). We  use  such information to respond
              effectively to your inquiry, fulfill your requests, and send you
              communications that you request and perform the requested
              services.
Information That Is Processed Automatically
On the basis of your permission we use third-party automatic data
            processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) to analyze
            certain information sent by your device via our App (Identity For
            Advertisers for iOS devices/ Advertising ID or Android ID for
            Android devices). Some integrated advertising or analytics tools
            (check Section IV to see the list of them) launch automated
            processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means
            any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate
            certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze
            or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests,
            behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described
            below). Processing information through automatic data processing
            technologies starts automatically once you allow our App to track
            your activity. You can withdraw your permission at any time - please
            check opt-out options in Section VIII below.
We may process some information about your device and your user
            behavior on the ground of our legitimate interest. This information
            falls within categories of data described above in Subsection
            “Information That Is Processed Automatically”, it is generally
            non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct
            association with any specific individual, and we may access it only
            in aggregated form. We use this information for improving our App
            and giving our users the best experience.
Device Details.
When you use a mobile device
              (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, some of details
              about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”.
              Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures
              stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
              identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device
              identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content
              and ads by the third parties.
What data can be processed:
Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of
              operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen
              size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery,
              device memory usage.
Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network
              provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of
              sessions, speed, browser.
Location-related information: IP address, the country code/
              region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device,
              language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of
              interest (eg. “coffee shop”).
Other device identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set
              up by the App’s developer).
Information about the applications
. Name, API key
              (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can
              be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services
              also record the list of applications and/or processes which are
              installed or run on your device.
Cookies and similar technologies.
When you use
              the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web
              beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small
              amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you
              access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each
              time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more
              effectively. For example, we will know how many users access a
              specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads
              they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand
              and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts,
              and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We
              may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to
              the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.
Log file information.
Log file information is
              automatically reported each time you make a request to access the
              App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your
              device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record
              certain log file information, including time and date when you
              start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
Ad-related information
. The following data might
              be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a
              particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked” or if
              it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about;
              what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad
              placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the
              App); whether you respond to the ad.
In-app events.
When you use our App, analytics
              tools automatically record your activity information (tutorial
              steps, levelling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events,
              progression events, method of limiting the processing of user
              data).
Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools
            does not generally come to our control, therefore we cannot be
            responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some
            services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain
            information related to your personality and/or your device by using
            technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. In
            case when your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook
            may use your device information in association with categorized data
            that were already recorded in its databases (eg. your age, gender or
            other demographic indication). We do not control, supervise or stand
            surety for how the third parties process your personal data, that
            might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Any
            information request regarding the disclosure of your personal
            information should be directed to such third parties (see Section
            IV).
Payment Information
Our e-commerce provider (Apple / Google) is responsible for billing,
            processing and charging for the in-app purchases, handles your
            personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This
            information is processed as part of the performance of the contract
            between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit
            card information. You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase
            rules and policies directly from the app stores.
III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA

            new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information
            for the following purposes:

              other targeted content

To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law
. We
            really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so

            prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce
            our Terms of Use.

            Mobile Environment.
Please note that while integrating external services we choose third
            parties that can assure they apply all necessary technical and
            organizational measures to protect user personal data. However, we
            cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted from us
            to any such third party. We are not responsible for any accidental

            including Placer Labs, Inc. for its marketing and business purposes,

            third-party partners may use this information according to their own
            privacy policies.To opt-out of our sharing location data with our
            third-party partners, you can opt-out through the Do Not Share My

            that third country, or to the international organization where data
            protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same
            level of protection of a personal data as your country does.
We try to make sure that the recipient of any personal data provides
            a proper protection of the personal data received, in accordance
            with the current legislation on the protection of such information.

For the purposes of data storage, we recourse to the services of the
            hosting organizations. We take your privacy seriously and,
            therefore, encrypt your personal data - if possible - before sending
            it to the hosting organizations for the purposes of its storage.
