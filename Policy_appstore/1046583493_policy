Summary of this notice
We (Super Smashing Ltd, trading as “Blink”) use your personal data as a data controller for certain
purposes
including (depending on your relationship with us) account creation, identity verification, direct marketing, and analytics.
In other scenarios, we may be a data processor acting on behalf of other organizations, for example, your employer. In such cases, this notice does not apply, and you should instead refer to the privacy notice of that organization responsible for your data.
For the purposes set out in this notice, data is
shared
with others including our business customers, other Blink group companies and third-party vendors. In some instances, data is transferred outside the UK/EEA, including to the US.
Where we rely on your consent, such as in the case of some cookies, you can withdraw this consent at any time.
In some case, you also have
data protection rights
including the right to object to some of the processing which we carry out.
Who we are
We are Blink, a UK-based company with global offices as set out below:
Super Smashing Ltd, 2 Westland Place, London, England, N1 7LP;
Blink Business Technologies Inc, a Delaware corporation, with its registered office address at 353 West 48th Street, 4th Floor New York, NY 10036 ("Blink Inc"); and
Blink Business Technologies Pty Ltd, a proprietary company registered in New South Wales, with its registered office address at 114-120 Castlereagh Street, Sydney NSW 2000.
In this notice, “
Blink
”, “

”, “
we
” refers to these companies collectively. We may also refer to these companies as “
Blink group companies
”.
We operate a website and provide an employee experience application accessible via mobile, desktop or the internet (the “
App
”) to employers
who are our business customers (our “
Customers
”), and through
which we make our services, such as our communication platform, work-management tools, surveys, and forms (our “
Services
”) available to Customers.
What this notice covers
This notice relates to the personal data processed in connection with the App and our Services in respect of which Blink acts as data controller. Super Smashing Limited will usually be the data controller, including for any of our data analytics activities in connection with the App. In other cases, for example for personal data processed in the context of your Business Contact relationship with your local Blink group company, the data controller will be one of the other Blink group companies. If you have any questions about this, you can contact us using the contact details under “
How to get in touch
” below.
If you are a:
Business Contact
(i.e., an individual working for one of our Customers, who acts as a point of contact between us and the relevant Customer, including Key Administrators of the App and Services) – we will be the data controller of your personal data we process in connection with your interactions with us. As a Business Contact, we may contact you about the agreement we have with the Customer, and otherwise use your data in order to manage our relationship with that Customer, for example to manage renewals or upgrades.
End-user
(an individual or prospective employee, worker or contractor of one of our Customers, making use of the App which our Customer has deployed) or an
Administrator
(an individual who manages functionality of the App and Services on behalf of that Customer via the administrator portal) – this notice is only relevant for certain personal data we process about you in connection with your use of the App and Services, and your interactions with us. An Administrator may also be a
Key Administrator
, being those Administrators who manage the Customer’s organizational account with Blink.
‍
Important note:
For processing we carry out that is not described in this notice, we are data processor (rather than a data controller), and your employer or hirer (our Customer) will be the data controller responsible for providing you with a notice about that processing. For more information on your employer’s (or hirer’s) privacy practices, please refer to their own privacy notice, which may be made available to you via the App. To the extent personal data is shared between us and your employer or hirer, there is an agreement in place between us and your employer or hirer which governs how this data is protected.

More particularly:
Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.
Where we process personal data for analytics purposes (to improve our services and/or to provide or enhance analytics for our Customers), we retain it for 2 years or until you ask us to delete your information (unless we have another legal basis for retaining such information or are required by our contract with the relevant Customer to retain it).
Where we process personal data for App and/or Sites security purposes, we retain it for usually not more than 90 days, or at a maximum up to 1 year.
Where we collect personal data through cookies or other tracking technologies, we retain it for as long as required for the particular cookie. For more information see our see the section on “

Information about you that is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is processed may be anonymised, pseudonymised, and/or aggregated with other non-personal data, to provide insights which could be commercially valuable to Blink, such as statistics relating to the use of the App and/or our Services. For example, we may retain anonymised or pseudonymised data on how individuals use the App or interact with the sign-up flow.

We may transfer your Personal Data to such third-party data controllers for the purposes described in our
Blink Privacy Notice
, including: to our Customers (including your employer/hirer) to provide trend and statistical analysis to customers and/or other relevant parties and/or to enhance the analytics we provide to other customers we may have from time to time as part of our services, however, only ever in aggregate and in a way that does not individually identify you.
We will only provide your Personal Data to third-party data controllers where you have not opted-out of such disclosures, or in the case of sensitive Personal Data, where you have opted-in if the DPF requires consent.
We enter into written contracts with any unaffiliated third-party data controllers requiring them to provide the same level of protection for Personal Data the DPF Principles require. We also limit their use of your Personal Data so that it is consistent with any consent you have provided and with the notices you have received.
If we transfer your Personal Data to one of our Blink Group Companies (inc. any other affiliated entities within our corporate group), we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data is protected with the same level of protection the DPF Principles require.
‍
International Transfer:
Where we transfer Personal Data received by us to third parties in locations which do not provide an adequate level of data protection, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the transfer. In the majority of cases, we will rely on relevant data transfer mechanisms (e.g., the appropriate module of the EU’s standard contractual clauses issued on 4 June 2021 (the “
EU SCCs
”). A copy of the relevant mechanism can be obtained for your review on request from
support@blink.com
.
‍

We may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful and valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We will only do so in accordance with the DPF Principles.
Security
We maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction in accordance with the DPF. We protect the Personal Data we receive, as described in the
