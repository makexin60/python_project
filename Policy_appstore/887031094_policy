Privacy policy
Retrospecs doesn't collect or store any of your data outside of the app. (If you don't choose to share images or videos, they don't leave the app.)
Older versions of the app (before version 3.7)
do
track some user activity anonymously (so I can see which parts of the app are the most popular) but this can be disabled within the settings screen. (It's the "Send anonymous usage information" option.)
