we provide you with more information about these programmes and how we and our brand partners use your information at the time you sign up to link your accounts

We use some of the information about you to build a picture of you (‘profiling’). This is for the purposes of improving and developing our products and services and to help us to tailor our marketing to you. We use information that we learn about you such as your gender, preferences, hobbies, interests, purchase history and how you react to the marketing we send you to make sure the marketing you receive from us, and the way our websites and mobile apps are displayed to you, are appropriate and tailored to you.
What’s our legal basis?
Compliance with legal obligations
We must comply with the law. This requires us to use your data to verify your identity and to prevent fraud and other types of crime. If you choose not to give us certain information when signing up for an account and when using our websites and mobile apps, we may not be able to sell you our products or provide our other services
Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract with you
When you buy our products, you enter a contract with us.  To fulfil our obligations under the contract (e.g. to allow you to place an order and receive products from us), we will process your personal information. If you do not provide the information we need or if you ask us to delete this information, it may mean we cannot sell you our products
Legitimate business interests
We use your personal data for the following, which we do because they are in the legitimate interests of our business:
Providing you with products you want and developing and improving our products
Researching and understanding our customers and how they buy and use our products
Offering promotions and loyalty programmes, including jointly with select brand partners
Passing your data to other companies within the JD Group and to selected third parties including brand partners

We rely on our legitimate interests for these activities, and you have the right to object to processing of this nature at any time by contacting our data protection team using the details at the end of this privacy notice
Although you also benefit from many of the above activities, we are required to carry out a balancing test of our legitimate business interests to ensure that the way we use your data for these purposes does not unreasonably intrude on your rights under data protection law. We are satisfied that processing of your data for these purposes does not unreasonably intrude upon your privacy and that we can therefore reasonably rely on legitimate interests as our basis for the above-mentioned processing activities
Consent
You will also receive marketing communications where you have consented to them.  If you’re an app user, and if you consent to it, we will use your location data to send push notifications when you are near one of our stores. These notifications may include offers and promotions relevant to you which are taking place at a nearby store or to let you know that an item in your wish list is available at a nearby store
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by updating your marketing preferences in your account, turning off push notifications/location data using the settings in your mobile device and/or contacting our data protection team using the details below
Marketing
We always give you the choice of whether or not you wish to receive marketing communications from us (for example by providing opportunities to opt-out of receiving marketing from us).

We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary to do the things that we collected it for (the things we’ve set out in this privacy notice) unless the law requires us to keep it longer.   We typically keep your personal data for 6 years from the date we collect it.  This usually allows us to deal with any issues or concerns you may have about the products or services you have received, and for other legal reasons such as if we need to keep your information to bring or defend legal proceedings etc. In some circumstances, some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, for example:
