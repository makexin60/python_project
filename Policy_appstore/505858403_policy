								anywhere. Members, Visitors, and others will find and see your
								publicly-shared content, including your name and photo (if you

							whereby users can unsubscribe. Users can unsubscribe from our
							newsletters whenever they want.

							based on ads. To provide you with a better experience, at any
							point in time, if you find any ad inappropriate, or not according
							to your taste, you can report or block it on Athan as well as
							IslamicFinder.org. IslamicFinder.org uses third-party tools to

							tools may also gather information about your visits to
							third-party sites outside of IslamicFinder.org. However, while it
							does not track your individual-level activity on the Internet
							outside of IslamicFinder.org, our vendors may collect information
							automatically collected by IslamicFinder.org (not information you
							provide), and combine it with data they collect elsewhere for
							targeted advertising purposes. You can opt-out of this type of
							data collection via Privacy Manager, Adchoices, and Do Not Track.
							See Your Choices about tracking and data collection below for
							methods to opt-out of this type of compilation. The outreach and
							education analytics tools provide reports which aggregate data
							such as the number of clicks on advertisements.

Protecting your privacy is very important to

Old classes is not a new section; they were previously referred to as “Online Classes” in the app and they will remain functional for users who wish to keep using them. Quran classes are a new addition to Athan Academy.
IWhen you send an audio to any class in one of your old classes or in any assignment in Quran classes, we will use your mobile phone’s microphone to send your audio recording to our teacher. Athan Academy will save these audios and use this data to help improve the quality of these classes.

In the community section, Athan Academy does not share any of your personal data with the teachers or other users other than the name with which you have created your account on Athan Academy.

						your “Email Address,” is used to send you more personalized emails and newsletters regarding

						receive any personalized emails from us once you unsubscribe to our newsletter.

						based on the App version number they are using. You are not obligated to respond 
						to polls or surveys. We use “Device ID” to send personalized notifications and updates 
						regarding our latest features. At any point in time, the user can opt-out of the push 
						notifications permission that he has given to Athan Academy by going to their device’s settings 
						and to IslamicFinder.org by going to the browser’s settings.
