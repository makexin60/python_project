Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Personal Data
We may only use your personal data when we have a legal basis to do so. We use different legal bases depending on the purpose of our processing activity. These legal bases are contractual necessity, legitimate interests (ours, yours, or those of another party), consent, compliance with a legal obligation, performing a task in the public interest, and protection of vital interests.
Here, we explain the legal bases we rely on when we process your information. This section also describes why we use your information, how this information is processed, and the associated rights, which always includes the right to access your information. For more information on how to exercise any of your rights, see the “
Your Rights and Choices
” section in the Privacy Policy.
Contractual Necessity
If you enter into a contract with us or we take steps at your request prior to agreeing a contract, we may process your personal data when it is necessary to perform the contract. This means we may use your personal data for purposes such as to enable the delivery of our services, become our customer or partner, communicate with you about orders, and enforce our terms and policies.
Legitimate Interest
We use your personal data when this is necessary to achieve legitimate interests—whether belonging to us, you, or a third party—provided these interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. This includes but is not limited to the following processing activities: when we communicate, when you use our services, when managing our marketing list, and sharing personal data with other parties to run our business efficiently and securely.
Consent
We ask for your consent to access or use your personal data for specific purposes. If we do, you will be able to revoke your consent by contacting us. This includes but is not limited to when you sign up for our newsletter or events, and request a demo.

•
Right to object to the processing:
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This right applies when we are performing a task in the public interest, pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party, or when your data is processed for the purpose of facilitating scientific or historical research in certain circumstances.

Contact Us
”

If you are not satisfied with how we have responded to any of your rights requests, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
Data Security and Retention
Security of your personal data is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of personal data and the purposes for which we use the personal data. If you have any questions about the retention of your personal data, you can contact us.
International Data Transfers
The personal data we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in to locations where we and our third-party service providers have operations.

If you wish to inquire further about these safeguards used, please contact us.

Purposes of Data Processing
: Zscaler may act as a data processor or a data controller when processing non-HR personal data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States of America, depending on the product(s) or service(s) being provided. The types of non-HR data we collect and process varies depending on the business relationship, the product or service being provided, customers’ preferences, contractual requirements with customers, and the legitimate interests, including marketing, security, billing, transaction processing, product support, and relationship management.
• Notice:

• Choice
: Zscaler offers individuals the opportunity to opt out of personal data, or opt in for sensitive data being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than to Zscaler’s service providers under contract or pursuant to lawful request as set forth below), or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
• Access
: Individuals whose personal data may be processed by Zscaler are entitled to obtain confirmation of whether such personal data is being processed, access the information held, and ask us to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the laws. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable time frame.
• Accountability for Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties)
: When Zscaler transfers personal data to a third party, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the third-party processes personal data for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with our DPF obligations.

• Enforcement and Dispute Resolution
: If you have a question or complaint related to Zscaler’s participation in the DPF, please contact the Privacy Team at
privacy@zscaler.com
. Please note, to pursue your rights under the DPF, your complaint must concern personal data received from the EU, UK, or Switzerland in reliance on the DPF, which excludes any personal data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), any approved derogation from the EU Directive, or other non-DPF data transfer mechanisms.
Zscaler has further committed to refer unresolved DPF complaints to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, which is the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR/AAA”), located in the United States.

Data Privacy Framework Panel
. DPF-certified organizations must respond within 45 days of receiving a complaint.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Website and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as Interest-Based Advertising (“IBA”). We adhere to the
Digital Advertising Alliance
(“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this activity.
We use data collected from non-affiliated websites over time as well as other data described in this Policy to provide advertising on behalf of our clients that is relevant to interests inferred from this data. We may also partner with other ad companies to extend our audiences across different browsers for interest-based advertising purposes. If you would like to exercise choice regarding our collection of web viewing data from web browsers for interest-based advertising purposes please visit
https://optout.aboutads.info/
and select “opt out of all”, or if located in the European Union, you can click here to make choices with respect to companies integrated in the YourOnlineChoices consumer choice platform.
When you make your choices on your browser using these choice tools, we will stop collecting and using data from that browser and associated browsers for interest-based advertising on it. We will also stop using data collected from that browser on other browsers associated with it, and will stop using data collected from those associated browsers for interest-based advertising on the opted-out browser. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
You may visit the DAA WebChoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about IBA and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.
Companies participating in the WebChoices tool may continue to collect data for non-IBA purposes such as for analytics and other non-IBA related ad operational purposes. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Site may not function as intended.
Children’s Privacy
