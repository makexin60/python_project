Terms Of Use
Last updated: June 29,
            2021
Please read our Privacy Policy for information on how we handle
            your personal
            information. By using our service you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information
            as described in that policy and in these Terms of Service.
Our goal is quality of service for all of our
            customers. While our
            service
            has
            sufficient capacity to
            support average personal usage, if your usage is excessive relative to the average, we may need to limit
            your bandwidth or suspend your account. You also cannot use our service for things that could hurt our
            service, company or other people. See our detailed acceptable use policy for more information. We
            reserve the right to refuse service if we think it’s the right thing to do for our customers.
We might need to change these terms of service from time to time. If
            we make
            important
            changes we will
            notify you by email.
Terms Of Use
Bandwidth Limitations
The Service has sufficient capacity to accommodate average
            non-commercial use.
            However, from time to time during periods of extraordinarily heavy usage of the Service, you may
            temporarily experience slower service or service unavailability. No such temporary slowdown or
            unavailability shall constitute a breach or default by VPN Master Pro of its obligations. VPN Master Pro
            reserves the right to temporarily suspend or limit your use of the Service if: (a) your usage level
            exceeds our average customer use level or otherwise negatively impacts the overall health of the network
            determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion, or (b) you exceed any bandwidth limitations
            associated with your account. No such suspension or limitation of the Service shall constitute a breach
            or default by VPN Master Pro of its obligations.
Use of the Service
You may not use the Service in any manner that could damage,
            disable, overburden
            or impair VPN Master Pro’s systems or networks, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of
            them. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any computer systems or networks associated
            with the Service. You may only use the Service for your personal, non-commercial purposes, and not in
            any way to provide, or as part of, any commercial service or application. You may not transfer your
            rights hereunder or your account access to any other person. You may not use the Service: (a) in a
            manner that violates any law or regulation; (b) in a manner that infringes or violates any privacy,
            intellectual property, confidentiality, contractual or other rights; (c) to transmit information that is
            defamatory, offensive, misleading, false, harmful to minors or obscene; (d) to gain unauthorized access
            to any service, account, computer system or network; (d) to transmit any viruses or programming routines
            intended to damage, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data or personal information;
            (e) in contravention of any acceptable use or other information technology policy that may apply to your
            use of any computer system or network; (f) to send unsolicited email communications, or (g) in any other
            manner that VPN Master Pro deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.

            elsewhere in any
            document relating to the Service, VPN Master Pro shall not be liable for any disruption in the Service
