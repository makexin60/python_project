Information Collected
PLX Devices, Inc.’s primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a superior customized online experience, and outstanding Apps and customer service.
When you visit PLX Devices, Inc. (“PLX) web sites or license, you may provide us with the following types of information: (1) web site, App and email use information collected as you and other people browse, download and use our web sites and Apps or respond to PLX initiated email (example: type of web browser and operating system used to access the PLX web site or App), (2) information you knowingly and voluntarily choose to disclose to PLX that we collect on an individual basis (example: completing an online form requesting product literature or inputting your name, address, email, project management information, etc. or that of your customer/client), and (3) information about your device (example: internet protocol (IP) address, MAC address, and geolocation of your device). For supplemental information about specific data collection utilized within an App, please refer to that App’s End User License Agreement. The web browser you choose to use may have a “do not track” (or similar) option available in the browser’s settings. PLX does not currently respond to the “do not track” signal on its Websites or online services; PLX web sites or Apps may utilize 3rd party services (see Usage Reporting, below), you should review with those 3rd parties how they process “do not track” requests.
By using a PLX web site or App, you allow PLX to access information as stated above, and to record, compile and use such information in the provision and improvement of the services, features, and functionality available from the web site or App.
Web Site, App and Email Use Information
PLX utilizes technology to accumulate information about traffic on our web sites, use of Apps and the effectiveness of email communication with you. PLX may collect information 1) during your visit to a PLX web site or during download and use of an App, 2) when you open an email from PLX and – where legally required (e.g. in the EU) – you have given us your consent to do so, and 3) when you click a link within an email from PLX and – where legally required (e.g. in the EU) – you have given us your consent to do so, PLX utilizes automatic data collection tools which include web beacons, cookies, embedded web links, and similar information gathering tools. The data collected may include your IP address, the pages you view at PLX web sites, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with PLX web sites and Apps. PLX may also use some of these automatic data collection tools in connection with certain emails sent from PLX and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open an email or click on a link contained in an email from PLX if – where legally required (e.g. in the EU) – you have given us your consent. We use this information to: gather information in order to design and improve our web pages and Apps, monitor web site, email and App usage, and compile business and technical statistics. We may share this information on an aggregate or individual basis with third parties in furtherance of our business needs. However, PLX does not sell or rent such information to third parties for the purpose of soliciting you for nonPLX products and services. For supplemental information about the specific uses of data collected from your use of an App please refer to that App’s End User License Agreement.
Information You Disclose to PLX; Use of Information by PLX
We strongly advise you NOT to submit to us sensitive information, such as your Social Security Number or credit card information, unless it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of your communication. Even though we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
We will process information that we have collected about you for our business purposes such as preparing quotations, handling orders, opening accounts or evaluating credit requests. We may also process your information for advertising or research purposes unless you object to such processing. We might forward personal data to other PLX group companies and service providers in accordance with applicable data protection regulations. This includes, if for example you are located in the EU/EEA, forwarding your information to entities outside the EU/EEA if the receiving entity provides for an adequate protection of personal data according to the European Data Protection Directive.
Please be advised that, as permitted by local law and regulation, any information that you provide to PLX shall become the sole and exclusive property of PLX upon submission. PLX may disclose information that you have provided us if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or legal process served on PLX; or (b) protect and defend the rights and property of PLX or others; in any event, PLX will disclose information only in accordance with applicable regulations.
Protection of Information
To protect your information, PLX uses an encryption technology when data is transmitted or shared with analytics companies who may assist us in understanding how our web sites and Apps are used. We may also share encrypted versions of the information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.
Email from PLX
You may receive email communication from PLX in two ways: 1) email received from an individual at PLX based on existing business relationships and 2) electronically initiated email originating from your interaction with a PLX web site or App. For electronically initiated email, should you wish to no longer receive such communications an “UNSUBSCRIBE” link will be included in the email by which you may elect to be removed from further email communications. In such an event PLX will remove your email address from further electronically initiated communication and you should not receive further email communications unless you subsequently interact with a PLX web site and again provide your email address.
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser when accessing a web site. Cookies are part of the flow of information between hardware devices and web browsers, and can be used for, among other things, customizing user interaction with web sites and enhancing web site performance and utility.
On our Sites we use the following types of cookies:
Google Analytics:
This cookie enables us to estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
You may elect to refuse to accept cookies by changing your browser preferences and/or utilizing commercially available software programs. Please understand that if you do not accept cookies from PLX’s web sites, it may affect the performance, including your ability to access certain features.
Web Beacons
PLX may utilize web beacons, clear GIF’s or similar technology to assist in delivering effective web site and App content to you. Web beacons may be used alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your web site and App usage and your interaction with email received from PLX. We may use such technologies to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.
Location/Notifications
The Kiwi App uses the device’s location during initial setup in order to determine accurate
sunrise/sunset times for scheduled events.  This only occurs during initial system setup or if the user
modifies the location within the “Settings” menu in the app.
The app may also use the device’s location if “Geofencing” is setup in the app. The mobile device will store a specific geographic region and detect when the location of the device has entered or exited this
region.  On this event the app will connect to the Smart Bridge and activate a scene or show a notification based on the settings.
Background App Refresh
In order to show the most up to date information about the lights, shades, and thermostats added to the app, the app will occasionally connect to the Smart Bridge when not in use to briefly update its data.
Photos/Media/Files
The Kiwi App logs diagnostic information on the device for troubleshooting purposes.  When a user chooses the option to “Send Feedback” in the app, the diagnostic logs on the device are accessed and sent to Lutron for analysis.  The Lutron App does not access any images, videos, audio files, or anyinformation on the device’s external storage (other than the app diagnostic logs)
Usage Reporting
PLX may utilize the analytics and crash reporting services of a 3rd party to provide us with anonymous statistical and technical information about your usage of our web site and Apps.
Our web sites and Apps may use the following services:
Google Analytics – This service provides us with anonymous data to help analyze our audience size and usage patterns on our Site. You may opt-out of reporting by Google Analytics by following the instructions on their site:
