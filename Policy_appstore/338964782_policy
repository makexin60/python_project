Honesty is key for us. We take your privacy seriously. Unless you decide otherwise, the data you track is stored only on your device.
You are in full control about how you share your data. The app offers these options:
email reports
backup to Dropbox and email
post to Twitter
None of these sharing options happen without you initiating them. If you decide to use the Twitter option, you need to tap a tweet button to send out an entry.
We do not use any tools or services to track when and how you use the app.
