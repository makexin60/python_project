At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
for Apple or
shazam.com/privacy
for Shazam.
To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or by calling 1-800-275-2273.

At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to
collect only the personal data that we need
. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
When you create an Apple Account, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:

Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
.
Fitness Information.
Details relating to your fitness and exercise information where you choose to share them
Financial Information.
Details including salary, income, and assets information where collected, and information related to Apple-branded financial offerings
Government ID Data.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government-issued ID in limited circumstances, including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law
Other Information You Provide to Us.
Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels
You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.
Apple may receive personal data about you from other
individuals
, from businesses or third parties acting
at your direction
, from our
partners
who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other
lawful sources.
Individuals.
Apple may collect data about you from other individuals — for example, if that individual has sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.
At Your Direction.
You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases.
Apple Partners.
We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the
Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form
. For more information about Applebot, visit
support.apple.com/120320
.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Power Our Services.
Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.
Process Your Transactions.
To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it’s also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
child’s educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
“cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

apple.com/legal/privacy/data/ww/apple-advertising

Apple products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible,
your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world,
including Apple-affiliated companies, to perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live.
For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. and other Apple-affiliated companies on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For example, Imagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps and to support our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc. in California.
Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Apple’s international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by
Standard Contractual Clauses
. If you have questions or would like a copy of Apple’s Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Personal data collected by
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures.
Apple’s privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit
Global CBPR Forum
. To view our certifications, visit
CBPR System Compliance Directory

Privacy Recognition for Processors Program
Personal data relating to individuals in the People’s Republic of China may be processed by Apple in countries outside of the People’s Republic of China, such as Apple Inc. in the United States or Apple Distribution International Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law. For the purposes of processing set out in this Privacy Policy, Apple may also transfer such personal data to third-party service providers, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of the People’s Republic of China. For more information, visit
China Mainland Privacy Disclosures
.
To make sure your personal data is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
If you have questions about Apple’s Privacy Policy or privacy practices including where a third-party service provider is acting on our behalf, or you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or call the
Apple Support number
for your country or region.
You can also ask us questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to help.
Apple takes your privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best to respond to your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or download request. In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other cases, we may require additional information or let you know that we need more time to respond.
Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.
You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with Apple’s response — refer your complaint to the applicable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.
When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

California Privacy Rights
California consumers have a right to knowledge, access, correction, and deletion of their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. California consumers also have a right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by a business, and a right not to be discriminated against for exercising their California privacy rights. Apple does not sell or share the personal information of California consumers as those terms are defined under California law, and does not discriminate in response to privacy rights requests. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit according to California law.
Apple provides notice of our privacy practices in our
Privacy Policy
. The Privacy Policy includes what personal information is collected, the source of the personal information, and the purposes of use, as well as whether Apple discloses that personal information and if so, the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed. More information about how Apple handles personal information in connection with specific Apple services is presented in service-specific notices at or before your first use of the service and is available at all times on your Apple device or at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
. To view a copy of the latest versions of the service-specific privacy notices and the California-specific disclosures, visit
California Privacy Disclosures
.
California consumers with an Apple account can exercise their rights directly or through an authorized agent by signing in to their Apple account at
privacy.apple.com
. If you are a California consumer without an Apple account and you or your authorized agent would like to exercise your privacy rights, you can make a request to
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
, or by calling 1-800-275-2273. If you do not have an Apple account, Apple will ask you for information that we consider necessary to verify your identity for security and to prevent fraud. This information may include name, contact information, and information related to your transaction or relationship with Apple, but the specific information requested may differ depending on the circumstances of your request. If we delete your personal information, we will both render certain personal information about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal information.
Do Not Track
Apple does not track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Third parties that have content embedded on Apple’s websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Apple website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personal information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.
Notice for Minors
Apple offers interactive services that allow you to post content to share publicly or with friends. At any time, you can delete or remove content you have posted by using the deletion or removal options within our services. If you have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if you would like additional assistance with deletion, you can contact our Apple Support team directly at
support.apple.com/contact
. Although we offer deletion capability for our services, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the services.

Apple Health Research Studies
This Privacy Policy summarizes the information we may collect or receive in connection with your use of any of our health research study Apps and participation in any of our healthcare research studies (each a “Study” and collectively “Studies”). This Privacy Policy does not cover information that we collect or receive about you in other contexts, such as when you purchase an Apple product, browse Apple websites, use other Apple mobile apps, or use for your general non-Study purposes your Apple device such as your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. For our privacy practices generally, please see our
general privacy policy
.
Informed Consent
To participate in any Studies, you must first review and sign an informed consent and authorization form (if applicable) ("Informed Consent") for the Study. By using an App, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy and as outlined in the Informed Consent. To the extent anything in this Privacy Policy conflicts with the Informed Consent, the terms of the Informed Consent will control.
Throughout this policy we may use the term "Study Team" to refer to all the entities that may have access to data collected from or about you through the Apps or as part of the Studies. For all Studies the Informed Consent will include specific information about the members of the Study Team.
Collection and Use of Information
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. Certain personal information and non-personal information, as described below, may be collected from or about you through the Apps or as part of the Studies.
Apple and its affiliates, and the other Study Team members, may share the information we collect through the App with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you decide to participate in the Study, below are examples of the types of information that we may collect and how we may use it.
What information we collect
When you download one of the Apps and enroll in one of the Studies, below are examples of the categories of information (which may include some personal information) that may be collected from or about you through the Apps ("Study Data"). The specific categories of information that will be collected about you as part of a Study will be described in the Informed Consent.
Contact information
such as your name, email address,  and phone number.
Demographic information
, such as your age, gender, state of residence, and race.
Medical history and information
, such as your height/weight, prior medical diagnosis and testing (e.g., diagnosis of an irregular heart rhythm), current and previous use of certain medications (e.g., blood thinning medications), certain family history (e.g., history of atrial fibrillation) and health habits (e.g., smoking). This information may be collected through in-app surveys or other health surveys that you may be asked to complete.
Sensor information
, such as heart rate and beat to beat calculations.
Technical data
, which in many cases is non-personal information, i.e., data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. Technical data includes, for example, information about your app usage (e.g., when an App was first launched), app version and installation ID, device identifier, and technical data about your device, such as operating system and model. Apple does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals.
Adverse event information
, such as a concern, adverse event, or other reportable matter arising in a Study.
Other information
, if any, described in the Informed Consent.
Your Contact information will be separated from the rest of the data collected from you through the Apps and as part of the Studies and replaced with a random code ("Coded Study Data") before it is received on Apple systems.  When Apple acts as the study sponsor, it is obligated to put in place a process that could include the review of non-Coded Study Data as needed to comply with law in certain jurisdictions or to fulfill Apple’s obligations as sponsor. Apple hires a third party to fulfill such obligations on its behalf and only Coded Study Data is received on Apple systems. For certain studies, if you experience a technical issue and consent to be transferred to Apple for additional technical support, Apple may have  access to certain information that directly identifies you. Other entities involved in the Study, such as the Study principal investigator or other Study Team members, may maintain Study Data in an identifiable form.
How we use your information
Your personal information, such as your contact information, if collected through the App, may be used for purposes described in the Informed Consent including:
To enroll you in the Study, including determining your eligibility for participation in the Study
To conduct and support the Study
To contact you with surveys or other messages related to the Study through in-app notifications, email, or otherwise
Your Coded Study Data may be used for purposes described in the Informed Consent including:
To conduct and support the Study
To develop health-related products and improvement activities
For other research studies, if permitted in the Informed Consent
To issue research findings and related reports, which will not identify you
Your technical data (as described above) may also be used to determine your eligibility for a Study and general usage of the Apps.
Disclosure to Third Parties
Service Providers
Apple and the other Study Team members may share your information with companies who provide services for or on behalf of the Study such as the independent third party institutional review board responsible for reviewing the Study and protecting your rights as a research participant, or third parties that have been hired to perform Study-related services, such as receiving and processing Study-related complaints, on our behalf. These companies are obligated to protect your information.
Others
Your personal information and Coded Study Data may also be disclosed to the following third parties:
Government and Regulatory authorities
, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and other federal or state government agencies.
Law enforcement or other third parties
pursuant to valid legal process such as a subpoena, litigation or court order. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
Other Approved Study Researchers
, if permitted by the Informed Consent certain third-party researchers who are approved may access limited Study Data. The categories of approved study researchers, the type of Study Data they may have access to, and the purposes that they may use the data for will be described in more detail in the Informed Consent.
Others,
if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. We disclose information as described in the Informed Consent. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
Protection of Your Information
Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Apple has implemented reasonable measures to keep the Study Data it maintains safe, and to protect the confidentiality of your information, including storing it in systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. Despite our security measures, total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
Retention of Personal Information
Your participation in any Study is voluntary. You may decide not to participate or you may leave any Study at any time. If you decide to withdraw, we may not delete the information that we have already collected and we may continue to use it, but we will stop receiving any new Study Data about you and will stop contacting you about the Study except in the case of serious, actionable medical need. The specific retention policies and the steps you need to take to withdraw will be described in the Informed Consent for each Study.
Children
Our Apps are not intended for children under the age of 13 or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
Privacy Questions
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy please
contact us
. If you have questions about a Study please contact a Study Team member using the contact information listed in the Informed Consent. To withdraw from the Study, please follow the specific instructions in the Informed Consent. Please note that deleting an App will not withdraw you from the Study.
Apple may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we change the policy in a material way, notice will be provided to you either in the App or through a Study-specific email along with the updated Privacy Policy. We may also provide a notice on any Study-specific website.
