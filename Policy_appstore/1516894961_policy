Codye and Pilz Time- Privacy Policy
The following policies apply to our app Codye and Pilz Time
User information
Codye runs and stores all information locally. No user data is collected or sent to the developer. The purchases service is managed by a third party (RevenueCat), but it does not provide personal information about users. All forms of identification for subscription purposes are anonymized and inaccessible to the developer.
Pilz Time runs and stores all information locally. There are no purchases since It's a custom app for an enterprise client, so It does not have RevenueCat integration.
