We use information collected about you only as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services, products, offers and information you have requested and those which we believe will optimize your use of the Site. We may use your personal data for the following purposes:
•           To provide the information, or services, offers or support you request and related after-sales services;

We will only process your personal data where we have your consent to do so, which you may withdraw at any time, or otherwise where this is necessary for:
The performance of our contract with you for the provision of ESD services or products or to take preliminary steps at your request;
Us to fulfill our legal obligations; or,
The purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests. Our legitimate interests are those where we consider that we have implemented sufficient checks and protections to ensure that your rights and interests are not unreasonably intruded on. However, you can object to processing based on legitimate interests, and if you do so, we will stop processing the personal data unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds which override your rights and interests, or we need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims –
see “Your rights” at page 9

We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, to comply with our legal obligations or in the interests of security, public interest or law enforcement in any country where we have entities or affiliates. For example, we may respond to a request by a law enforcement agency or regulatory or governmental authority.

We share your information with NYS ESD staff as determined by NYS ESD, Simpleview CRM staff, Simpleview Marketing Automation Specialist staff, Simpleview Account Services staff and third parties who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose.
A user may opt-out from receiving email communications. The unsubscribe link in email communications offers the recipient a chance to opt-out of marketing email communications. The history of these opt-ins/opt-outs syncs to a database.
Marketing can create email campaigns using synced, contact-based advanced searches. These searches may reside in various user groups within the database.
Information gathered through forms is integrated into a database and can be used to build and manage marketing campaigns. Additionally, email subscriptions are also managed in this database.
