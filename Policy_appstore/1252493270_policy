Limitations of
SANNCE
Services
The SANNCE Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Products. While we strive for the SANNCE Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time. The SANNCE Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications, and carriers, among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that SANNCE is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the SANNCE Services to reflect current status of the Product, notifications, or timing of Your Content.
The SANNCE Services may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair, updates, adjustments, or other circumstances. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for any such suspension. SANNCE does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the SANNCE Services.

Limitations of the

As another example, we rely on mobile operating system vendors and mobile carriers to enable mobile device notifications through the SANNCE Services. These third-party products and services are beyond our control, and their operation may not operate in a reliable manner or be available 100% of the time. SANNCE is not responsible for any damages and losses due to the operation of these third-party products and services.

You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and SANNCE and not with an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from that App Store. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Mobile Apps, is conditioned upon your compliance and agreement with such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.
