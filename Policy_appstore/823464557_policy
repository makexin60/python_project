Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes the information collected by us through our mobile applications and how we use that information.
When you download and use our mobile applications, we don't require you to provide any personal information.
We use Google Admob to show ads in order to keep the app free. To do that, Google and other partners will collect data and use a unique identifier on your device to show you ads. We use Facebook SDK to allow you (if you wanted) to login and submit a question to your friends to help solve one of the questions in the game. This is completely under your control and it is an optional feature you do not have to use. We also utilise Facebook analytics to gather information about the app usage (such as how many questions solved, how many levels finished,..) to help us understand how the players going on in the game. We do not store any personal information on our servers. We just use the previously mentioned sdks utilising their own provided dashboards. Facebook SDK might use your mobile identifier to generate statistics.
Users may contact us via email if they have questions about our mobile applications. We may receive a user's email address and other information about a user if the user submits that information to us through email. We will only use this information to respond to any inquiries from the user.
Please feel free to contact us with any questions about our privacy policy and practices.
