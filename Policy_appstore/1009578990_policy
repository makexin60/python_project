COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Universal uses “cookies” to obtain certain types of data when your web browser accesses our website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable our system to recognize your browser, to provide various types of functionality, to better understand how you interact with our website, to monitor aggregate usage, and to optimize web traffic routing on our website. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Certain areas or features of the website may not be available or fully-functional if you choose to disable cookies.
See Universal’s Cookie Declaration at
https://www.universalweather.com/cookie-declaration/
for information on the cookies we use.
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.  We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”).  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website.  This allows us, for example, to determined whether an email has been viewed by a user, monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will often impair their functioning.
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies that are not essential.  You can exercise your cookie preferences through the cookie banner or the
cookie declaration page
on our website.
DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR
When we use your data for our own purposes, we act as the data controller, as that term is used in applicable privacy laws, for any personal data that we collect from you. When we collect data from or on behalf of our customers (e.g., charter aircraft operators, corporate aviation departments), those customers are the data controllers and we are the data processor. If we are acting as the data processor, we will only process the relevant data in accordance with instructions from the data controller.
DATA RETENTION, ACCESS, CORRECTION, DELETION AND PORTABILITY
We retain the personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). In some cases, we will retain the data for a longer period as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, follow records retention policies, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
You may request access, correction, erasure or portability of your personal data that we process.  We will grant such request except where an exception under the law would make it inappropriate to comply with all or some of the request to request access to, correction of, or erasure of your personal data, please contact us as set forth at the end of this privacy policy. In cases where we are not the data controller (such as when the personal data was collected from or on behalf of a charter aircraft operator, corporate aviation department or other customer), we may need to refer you or your request to the applicable data controller.
SECURITY
Universal is very concerned with safeguarding your personal data. The integrity and availability of your personal data are critical to the provision of superior products and services to you. We employ appropriate technical, organizational, administrative, physical, procedural, and technological measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access or alteration and loss or misuse.
We have implemented a multi-layered approach to protect electronic information through a comprehensive Information Technology (IT) Security program. Our IT Security program is designed to safeguard electronic information by proactively providing leadership and support for areas related to network security, system security, risk assessment, remediation tracking, and adherence to security compliance mandates. Universal employees work as a team so that information is protected against unintentional disclosure and are guided by compliance objectives, standard operating procedures, and acceptable usage policies.

The Universal Entities rely upon Article 46(2)(d) (the Standard Contractual Clauses) or Article 49(1)(b) (necessity for the performance of a contract) as the legal basis for the transfer of personal data to a third country.
We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this policy and applicable laws. The safeguards we use to transfer personal data are in case of both our group companies and third party service providers and partners, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021 under Article 46(2) using controller to controller and controller to processor transfers, including the UK Addendum for the transfer of data originating in the UK.
You have the right to lodge an inquiry or compliant with a supervisory authority in your member country.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
We do not sell your personal information to third parties. California law entitles California residents to certain additional protections regarding personal information. For purposes of this section alone, “personal information” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. California residents have the right to request:
information regarding your personal information we have collected in the past 12 months (including the categories of personal information we have collected, the categories of sources of such information, and the purposes for which we have collected such information);
notice of whether we have disclosed your personal information to third parties in the past 12 months (and if so, what categories of information we have disclosed, and what categories of third parties we have disclosed it to);
a copy of your personal information collected by us in the past 12 months; and
that your personal information be deleted.
We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise any of these rights. To make any of the above requests, please contact us as set forth at the end of this policy. We may require verification of your identity before further processing your request. In certain instances, we may be permitted by law to decline some or all of such request.
TRANSFER OF BUSINESS
In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of Universal, one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the data we have collected. We will advise a successor or successors in interest of the terms of this privacy policy and our expectation that the successor(s) in interest will adopt and maintain this policy until there is a notification of an amendment of this policy.
CHILDREN
Universal’s website is not directed toward children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal data without their consent, please contact us as set forth at the end of this privacy policy and we will take reasonable steps to remove such data from our systems.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
Universal and its successor(s) in interest reserve the right to and may revise this privacy policy from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory, technical or business developments.
If we make a material change to this policy, we will post the updated privacy policy (with the date of change(s) noted in the policy) on the Universal homepage and other places we may deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
