Other Important Information
The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:
Transmission Of Information To Other Countries.
We transmit information between and among our affiliates and to service providers outside of the European Economic Area. As a result your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Nonetheless, where possible we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States and Canada. If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information below. You may also request a copy of any Standard Contractual Clauses we use for the transfer of your data outside of the EEA, which includes the categories of information transferred by contacting us using the contact information below.
Third Party Applications/Websites.
. We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. We strongly advise you to read all third-party terms and conditions and privacy policies.
Changes To This Privacy Policy.
We may change our privacy policy and practices over time. We will notify you of material changes to our privacy policy or privacy practices by posting the amended policy with an updated date on our Sites.  If we make significant changes that materially affect your privacy rights, we will provide advanced notice and make that clear on the Sites, or by some other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before you continue to use the Sites.

If you have reason to believe that we may have collected such personal data, please notify us immediately at privacy.ik@Ikmultimedia.com.
Information for California Residents.
California law indicates that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of information are collected, “sold” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose”(as those terms are defined under California law). You can find a list of the categories of information that we collect and share
here
. Please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we share about people other than yourself. If you would like more information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing please submit a written request to us using the information in the "Contact Information" section below.

Notice of Financial Incentive under California Law.
We offer our customers a rewards program that provides discounted prices on IK products (“JamPoints”). You are automatically enrolled in JamPoints when you become an IK Multimedia product owner. As a result, we use the personal information from your account and purchases to maintain your JamPoints account. Because JamPoints involves the collection of personal information, it might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the discounted products that you obtain when you redeem points. This value is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services. You may withdraw or re-join from participating in JamPoints at any time from the JamPoints section of your User Area account. Visit the full JamPoints page to view full program rules, including how to join or withdraw.

California Information Sharing Disclosure
California Civil Code Sections 1798.115(c), 1798.130(a)(5)(c), 1798.130(c), and 1798.140 indicate that organizations should disclose whether the following categories of personal information are collected, transferred for “valuable consideration,” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose” (as those terms are defined under California law). We do not “sell” your personal information as that term is defined under California law. The table below indicates the categories of personal information we collect and transfer in a variety of contexts.

As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.

By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States and Canada.

Information for California Residents.
California law indicates that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of information are collected, “sold” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose”(as those terms are defined under California law). You can find a list of the categories of information that we collect and share
here
. Please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we share about people other than yourself.

The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the discounted products that you obtain when you redeem points. This value is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services. You may withdraw or re-join from participating in JamPoints at any time from the JamPoints section of your User Area account.

California Information Sharing Disclosure
