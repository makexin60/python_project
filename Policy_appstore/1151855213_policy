The right to request deletion and correction of information
You may ask us to correct any incorrect information about you (see the "Exercise of Rights" section for details). We are happy to correct such information, but we need to verify its accuracy first.
If you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to use your information for the purpose for which it was collected, you may request that we delete your information. In addition, you may request us to delete your information if you have revoked your consent to our use of your information (if we originally asked you to consent to our use of your information), or have exercised your right against further lawful use of your information, or if we have used your information unlawfully, or if we are bound by legal obligations to delete your personal information.

In individual cases, we may not be able to comply with your request, for example, your request may affect our duty of confidentiality to others, or we may be legally entitled to handle your request differently.
