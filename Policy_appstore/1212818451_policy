We use this data to improve our products and services and help you discover and embrace cultural experiences. As personal data can be directly or indirectly linked to your identity, contact information or location, we take our responsibility to safeguarding your personal data very seriously.
Please read this privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use and protect your personal data.

In addition, you may be asked to grant access to your current location when using the website or mobile applications, which is done to identify and help you discover cultural experiences and attractions in your area. Finally, if you reached Tiqets through a third party (such as another website or reseller), we may also receive your personal data from them.

Finally, we may get in contact to update you on any exceptional circumstances that are beyond our control by may affect your experience with our products or services, including but not limited to general strikes and threats to your personal safety.

We will only store your personal data temporarily for the purposes listed above, save for situations where laws or regulations dictate otherwise.

You can unsubscribe from these newsletters at any time by clicking the ‘Unsubscribe' link in the newsletter or, alternatively, by contacting us through our contact details stated at the bottom of this privacy policy.

Cookies and Google Analytics
We want you to enjoy visiting our platform, and we use cookies to ensure that our website (www.tiqets.com) runs smoothly and reliably. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. These cookies are placed on your device by your web browser and are either removed each time you close your browser or stored for a longer period of time. Cookies that aren't removed are sent back to us by your web browser the next time you visit. This enables us to recognize your computer or mobile device and improve and personalize your interactions and experiences on the Tiqets website. We also use other tracking technologies that are similar to cookies, such as third party tools, to achieve the same goal.
We strive to not embed cookies with a lifespan longer than one year, although there may be exceptions to this time period. Cookies can be placed on your devices by us or by a third party, such as Google Analytics (Google's official web analytics service). Google Analytics allows us to understand, in aggregate fashion, where visitors land on our website and how they use the site. We cannot disaggregate this data to analyze your individual behavior on our website.
Our website uses technical, functional, analytical and commercial cookies.
Technical cookies
– these are necessary to provide the requested service. For instance, technical cookies allow you to proceed through different pages of a website with a single login.
Functional cookies
– these cookies help our website and mobile applications "remember" your preferences i.e. language selection, search history and registration information.
Analytics cookies
– these cookies are placed by third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, and track how you find and interact with our website or mobile applications. This tracking system can be quite detailed, examining the average amount of mouse movements, scrolling activities, search words used and text entered in various fields. We can use this information to make our website easier to find, improve your interaction with our platform or measure the impact of our online marketing efforts. We want to point out that these third party service providers may also use information gathered about you on other websites or mobile applications over which we have no control. If you want to know more about how Google Analytics collects, uses and protects your privacy, you can consult Google's privacy policy by visiting
www.google.com/policies/privacy
.
Commercial cookies
– these cookies are used for tailoring our newsletters to your preferences and personalizing online advertisements. Such personalized adverts can also be shown on other websites you visit. This "retargeting" is based on your browsing activities, such as cultural attractions you're searching for. Commercial cookies can also help prevent the same advertisement continuously reappearing on different sites.
The consent you give us to store and use our and third party cookies can be withdrawn at any time by setting your browser to disable cookies and/or remove all cookies from your browser. However, please take into account that this may limit your access to certain functions and areas on our platform. Alternatively, if you do not wish to receive tailored advertising, visit
www.networkadvertising.org

Third party access to personal data

Suppliers

Other Tiqets entities
– we may share your information with our legal subsidiaries and other Tiqets entities that are part of the Tiqets corporate family.
Business partners
– if you book an admission ticket with us through one of our business partners, it's possible that such business partner receives your personal data, which they can then use for their own purposes. In this context, your information is governed by the privacy policies of these business partners. We may also share personal data with our partners to prevent or identify fraudulent transactions or other illegal activities on our platform (for which we rely on the legal basis of performance of a task of public interest).
Other third parties
– we use the services of third parties that collect, monitor and analyse personal data on our behalf, including Google. Such third parties are also used to personalize and distribute marketing materials, including advertisements. We also use third parties to process your payments, sharing  your personal data with them in order to complete financial transactions. All these parties are under the obligation to keep your personal data confidential, and can only use it for the initial purposes set out by Tiqets.
For example:

The IP address is processed by Sovendus in encrypted form, will be exclusively used for data security purposes, and will be anonymised seven days after receipt.

Only pseudonymised data are used for this purpose (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Our legitimate interest lies in the successful marketing of voucher and benefit offers from Sovendus cooperation partners.

Some of our advertising partners offer you our voucher offers after your online purchase on their website. To select a voucher offer that is currently of interest to you, our advertising partners transmit the hash value of your email address and your IP address to us in pseudonymised and encrypted form (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The pseudonymised hash value of the email address is used by us to take into account any possible objection to advertising (Art. 21 para. 3, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR).

After this, we will only use your data in pseudonymised form for the purpose of analyses (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (see b. above).
Once the details have been transmitted, the respective product provider is then responsible for any further processing of your data.
e. Email newsletter from Sovendus
If you select by your express consent (which you may withdraw at any time) your personal newsletter of one of our advertising partners, the respective advertising partner will directly send you by e-mail the selected newsletter (Art. 7 (2) No. 3 UWG, Art. 6(1) (a) GDPR).
To this end we will transmit your data and your consent declaration to the respective advertising partner (Art. 6 (1) (a) and (f) GDPR). If you wish to withdraw your consent, you may at any time contact the advertising partner.
f. Friendly Captcha
Friendly Captcha (Friendly Captcha GmbH, Am Anger 3-5, 82237 Wörthsee, Germany) is a privacy-friendly solution that makes it more difficult for bots to access our website. We have integrated the programme code into our contact form so that each visitor’s device can connect to the Friendly Captcha servers to receive a puzzle to solve. Once the puzzle has been solved, the device sends the solution to our website server, which then checks whether the solution is correct. Depending on the outcome, we can process or reject requests based on security rules.
Friendly Captcha will not set any cookies on your device.
Your IP address will be stored in hashed form.
Your personal data will be deleted within 30 days.
The legal basis for this form of processing is point (f) of Art. 6 (1) GDPR; we have a legitimate interest in protecting our website against abusive access by bots. You can find more information about the processing carried out by Friendly Captcha here:
Privacy Policy for End Users – Friendly Captcha

For this purpose, we process your e-mail address, your first and last name and your title. This processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest in advertising our services.
h. Sovendus Optimize
We use conversion optimisation technology to improve our targeted communication with customers. This technology enables us to track the use of our online shop. When our customers visit our online shop, for example, we can remind them of forgotten orders and point out special offers or allow them to subscribe to notifications and communications such as newsletters, to receive support and to have their shopping cart sent to them. We use email, instant messaging and other communication channels for this purpose. We need this conversion optimisation technology to run our online shop effectively and to make it more user-friendly in the long term. If and to the extent applicable, this processing will be carried out on the basis of points (a), (b) and (f) of Art. 6 (1) GDPR. You can object to the use of conversion optimisation technology in our online shop; we will make a note of your objection by setting a cookie in the browser you are currently using.

To this end we will transmit your data and your consent declaration to the respective advertising partner (Art. 6 (1) (a), (f) GDPR). If you wish to withdraw your consent, you may at any time contact the advertising partner.
j. Email newsletter from product suppliers
If you select by your express consent (which you may withdraw at any time) or on the basis of a contract your personal newsletter of a product supplier, the respective product supplier will directly send you by e-mail the selected newsletter (Art. 7 (2) No. 3 UWG, Art. 6 (1) (a) and (b) GDPR).
To this end we will transmit your data and your consent declaration or your contract declaration to the respective product supplier (Art. 7 (2) No. 3 UWG, Art. 6 (1) (a), (b) and (f) GDPR). If you wish to withdraw your consent, you may at any time contact the product supplier.

m. Change of purpose

n. Online applications
If you apply for a job with Sovendus, we will process your data to handle and evaluate your application (Art. 26 (1) GDPR). We need your address and telecommunication data marked as mandatory data to correctly assign your application and to contact you. Your application data marked as mandatory data allow us to assess the chances of success of your application.
If you are not chosen for or if you refuse the offered job, we will store your data for another three months for documentation purposes and then delete them, unless you have given us your consent to use your data for further application procedures (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
o. Use of SalesViewer® technology:
On the website https://online.sovendus.com, data is collected and stored for marketing, market research and optimisation purposes using the SalesViewer® technology of SalesViewer® GmbH on the basis of the legitimate interests of the website operator (Art. 6 [1] Lit.f GDPR).
For this purpose, a javascript-based code is used to collect company-related data and the corresponding use. The data collected with this technology is encrypted via a non-reversible one-way function (so-called “hashing”). The data is immediately subject to pseudonymisation and is not used to personally identify the visitor to this website.
The data stored within the framework of Salesviewer will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose, and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.
You can object to the collection and storage of data at any time with effect for the future by clicking on this link https://www.salesviewer.com/opt-out to prevent the collection of data by SalesViewer® within this website in the future. This places an opt-out cookie for this website on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you must click this link again.

q. Use of your data for web analysis and tracking purposes (Google Analytics)
In order to optimise this website and our services, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, a company incorporated and operated under Irish law (registration number: 368047) with its registered office at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“
Google
“). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will first be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
Google will use this information on our behalf to analyse your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide us with other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in this context is your consent in accordance to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR.
Your personal data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes or you withdraw your consent.
You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.
You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link
tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
. As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click on this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data within this website in the future (the opt-out only works in this browser and only for this domain). An opt-out cookie will be stored on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you must click this link again. You can find more information on this at
tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
or at
https://policies.google.com/privacy#products
,
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de
(general information on Google Analytics and data protection).
We would like to point out that Google Analytics is used on this website in the form of server-side tracking to ensure anonymised collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
In order to fully comply with the statutory data protection requirements, we have concluded a data processing agreement with Google. It cannot be ruled out that data processing may take place outside the scope of application of EU law. Any transfer of personal data to the USA takes place on the basis of the EU Commission’s adequacy decision of 10 July 2023 regarding the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
r. Google Tag Manager (GTM)
We use GTM, a tool from Google Inc., on our website. With GTM, we can manage our website tags via an interface. The GTM itself does not set any cookies and does not process any personal data, but works more like an asynchronous JavaScript tag injector. GTM also respects any tracking tags originally implemented by GTM and deactivated by you.
6. Right of objection and revocation at any time
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data, provided that the legal requirements are met (Art. 21 (1) GDPR).
If you want to object to the processing of your data for advertising purposes or if you wish to withdraw your consent (Art. 21 (2) GDPR), you may at any time send a short message to our Data Protection Officer by e-mail to
data-protection[at]sovendus.co.uk
or by mail to Sovendus GmbH, Data Protection, Bahnhofplatz 12, 76137 Karlsruhe, Germany. Your data will then no longer be processed for the advertising purposes covered by your objection or your withdrawal of consent.
This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before objection or withdrawal of consent.
If you object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes or if you withdraw your consent, we are obliged, according to data protection law pursuant to Art. 21 (3) GDPR, to enter the required data (name, address, e-mail address) into our internal advertising black list and to store (block) these data permanently, in order that we can compare them with future advertising files (Art. 6 (1) (c) and (f) GDPR). In this way we can ensure the ongoing observance of your objection or of your withdrawal of consent. We will use your blocked data exclusively for this purpose.

b. What are cookies and what do we use them for?
“Cookies” are small files that are downloaded to your computer’s hard drive by your web browser or other programs. These are stored locally on the hard disk of your computer and kept ready for later retrieval.
We use cookies
to enable and ensure necessary technical functionality (Art. 6 (1) (b), (f) GDPR), to respect user rejection of cookies and/or the revocation of their consent on the use of such cookies (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR).
Session cookies are only used for the particular session. These cookies are deleted after the end of the session, i.e. after leaving our website or when the browser window is closed. Other cookies remain on your end device for a longer period of time and enable us or third parties to recognize your browser on your next visit (persistent cookies).
c. Deletion of cookies/revocation of your consent
You can set your web browser to notify you when cookies are set or to reject all or specific cookies in general (e.g. only third-party cookies). If you disable cookies using your browser, however, you will no longer be able to use various functions on our website.
The following links will inform you about this possibility for the most commonly used browsers:
Explorer:
support.Microsoft.com/de-de/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies
Firefox:

Please note that if you delete all cookies, those cookies used to comply with the revocation options will also be deleted.
d. Measuring reach with Matomo
We use the web analysis software Matomo in order to measure the reach of our website (creating anonymous visit and performance statistics). Measuring the reach helps us to measure performance, find navigation problems, optimise the technical performance, evaluate the capacity of the required server as well as to analyse the viewed contents. It is indispensable for the functionality of our website (para. 5, section 3 of the ePrivacy guideline 2002/58).
In order to distinguish users when measuring reach, Matomo uses a digital fingerprint consisting of browser information (type, version, plugins and language), operation system as well as your IP address. This digital fingerprint is only valid for 24 hours and will be anonymised thereafter.
The IP address will be anonymised immediately after it has been collected (Para 6, section 1, GDPR). Our lawful purpose is to carry out anonymised reach measurements under the principle of data minimisation (Para 5, Section 1 C, GDPR).
Thereafter, the processed data will be used to create anonymous visit and performance statistics about the browser types used, the browser versions, operating systems, countries of origins, date and time of the server requests, number of visits, stay on the website as well as links used.
This information will be used for no longer than 25 months for the purposes of measuring reach and will be deleted thereafter.
The data generated by Matomo relating to the use of this website will be processed exclusively on our servers and the servers of your data processors (Para. 28 GDPR) and not transferred to third parties.
You may object to the reach measurement with Matomo at any time with effect for the future by clicking on this button.
Enabled (blue and switch on the right) / disabled (grey and switch on the left)
8. Logging
Every time a user accesses this website or websites in our advertising network, data about this process are stored and processed temporarily in a log file (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). These data include:
category or type of file requested,
data and time of request,
amount of data transferred,
notification whether the request was successful,
the access method/function preferred by the requesting terminal,
a description of the type of web browser used,
referrer (website from which you have reached our website)
IP address.
The temporary storing of these so-called server log data is required to perform the services for technical reasons and, thereafter, to ensure system security. The data are anonymised normally after seven days by shortening of the IP address.
9. How can you exercise your data protection rights?
If you have questions concerning the processing of your personal data by us, we will of course be pleased to provide information (Art. 15 GDPR) about the data relating to you. Moreover, provided that the legal requirements of the GDPR are met, you have the right to correction (Art. 16 GDPR), erasure (Art. 17 GDPR), restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR), data portability (Art. 20 GDPR) and the right to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR).
Please contact in all these cases our Data Protection Officer (see above 3.) at the communication addresses given there. If there is reasonable doubt about the identity of the natural person asserting the aforementioned rights, we will additionally request information necessary to confirm the identity.
Finally, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR, Section 19 BDSG).
10. Changes
From time to time it will be necessary to change the contents of this privacy policy. We therefore reserve the right to change it at any time. We will also publish the amended version of the data protection information here. If you visit us again, you should therefore read the privacy policy again.
