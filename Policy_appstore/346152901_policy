Our Company and Data Protection Officer Details
T101’s Right to Amend this notice
T101 takes privacy very seriously, especially given the sensitive nature of some of the data that we handle. This notice sets out how we treat your personal data and how we expect you to treat any personal
data with which you come into contact on our sites. Please read it carefully before using any of our sites as it concerns use of your personal information. In particular, please pay attention to the section
on
Photos and Images
because, by accepting this privacy notice, you will be giving your explicit consent to any images that you upload to our sites being approved by moderators
outside the EEA via a web browser under strict controls. All your data, including photos, will continue to be stored on servers in the EU.
The notice has two layers. The first layer gives an overview of each of the above topics and contains links to help articles and further explanations. The second layer gives more detail about the topics in
the first layer.
T101 staff will never ask you for your password. Please help us to protect your privacy by keeping your password safe and not sharing it with anyone.
The data protection law in the UK will change on 25 May 2018. Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we reserve the right to make amendments to this privacy notice.
This version was last updated on 16 March 2021.

Special Category Data
When you create a profile on Recon, we ask you to disclose some special category personal data about your sexual orientation and your sex life so that you, and other members, can find people with similar interests.
You also have the option to disclose your ethnicity and your attitude to safer sex, however these are optional fields. If you choose not to disclose your ethnicity or your attitude to safer sex, your profile will not display them, and you won’t appear in searches where specific attributes of these categories of data are specified.
The special category data on your profile is visible to all other members including those who have joined but not yet created a profile.
You can also request a link (URL) that gives access to your profile from the web. If you choose this option, you should be aware that your personal data, including special category data, will be visible to anyone on the Internet who has, or guesses, your URL. Only the images in your Main Photos Gallery and thumbnails of photos in your other public galleries are shown when this URL is used.
Our surveys are usually designed to elicit anonymous responses, however if you have kindly assisted us with face-to-face interviews recently, we may have some special category data about you.

Part of our revenue is derived from advertising on our sites and apps, including sponsored member messages and news articles.  This enables us to provide some of the services on our site free of
charge. All advertising is booked through our own advertising department to ensure that it is relevant to our members. T101 manages its own advertising server, which is hosted for us by a specialist company. We only send aggregated statistics to our advertisers and do not share any of your personal data with them. When you click on a link within an advert on our site, you may be taken to
the advertiser’s site. This privacy notice will no longer apply while you are on their site, and you should ensure that you read their privacy notice carefully.

What happens to my data?
What we do with your data
Your data is uploaded onto servers, all of which are in Data Centres in the European Union.

Terms and Conditions
and by law. Please note that our partner company
accesses these photographs

An overview of the security measures that we take to look after your data
We employ several security measures to help limit the loss, damage, misuse and defacement of information that we control. Information that is gathered by us is stored on our secure servers in the European
Union, which are protected by physical and electronic security. Your personal data is encrypted and stored on encrypted drives.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

How we process your photos and images
Photos that you upload onto Recon must meet the standards that we set out in our
Terms and Conditions
, or the
terms under which we are permitted to provide our mobile apps. The photos, which remain on the servers in the EEA, are accessed via a browser located at fixed IP addresses at our partner
company. The team at that company is based outside the EEA. T101 contracts with that company to provide highly-trained staff who will respect the privacy laws and who are able to classify
your photographs at a speed that allows us to make them available in your galleries within an acceptable delay. The IP addresses allowed access are controlled by T101, and your
photographs are classified using software, which is developed and supplied by us and runs on servers located in the EU. The photographs are stored in the EU and are not permanently
stored elsewhere. You can read the rules on images in
the help article on Photos and Galleries
.
Any images that do not comply are deleted. You can decide whether to make an image available for other members to view, to place the image in your private gallery or to delete it if you want
to, however it may be moved to your private gallery automatically depending on the classification.

Automated Decisions
We use proprietary algorithms and a secure, third-party service to detect spammers and abuse. If you think that you have been refused an account in error, you have a right to request that we assess your eligibility manually. You can request
this by contacting our
Customer Services Team
. Once assessed manually, T101’s decision is final. We retain a small amount of
data from applications that are refused to enable these algorithms to protect our members.
reCaptcha
When you register to join Recon, we want to do our best to ensure that we are not allowing bots and spammers to join rather than genuine people. We use a service called reCaptcha from Google Inc (Google) to assist us with this. When you first fill in your email address, username and password on the application to join, reCaptcha sends information about the cookies, plugins, the site and language used as well as part of your IP address (which cannot identify you) to Google. Google only uses this information to tell us whether the registration is likely to be from a bot or a spammer rather than a real person. It also places a reCaptcha cookie on your device.

Who else can see my data?
Access to your data by T101 Staff
Access to your data by T101 staff is restricted to only those required to provide and maintain our services to you. Should we need to access your data for any reason, we will inform you unless
prevented from doing so by law. Please note, however, that some members of staff are also genuine members of our sites and are acting in a purely personal capacity in this regard.

Information sharing and Third Parties
To provide the best service to you we may have to share your personal data with the third parties set out in this privacy notice.
Our payment-processing partner uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that information between yourself and their servers is encrypted; the purchasing system is secure and any
information passed between your computer or mobile device and the payment-processing computer cannot be read by anyone that happens to intercept it.
We are using a third-party partner to check a small amount of information about how you are connecting to our services to prevent fraud, spamming and other forms of abuse. Our partner is GDPR-compliant and does not publish or pass this information to anyone else.
Your photographs
are accessed over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) by our partner company for the time necessary to classify them for compliance and quality purposes only. For additional security, access is
restricted to specific IP addresses and to authorised personnel only.
If you book to attend one of our events, you may be taken to a third-party site such as Eventbrite. Whilst you are on this site, their privacy notice and not this one will apply.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their
own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
