What information we collect and how we use it?
Smart Tasks does not require any form of registration or the creation of a personal user account to use it. You can use Smart Tasks anonymously without having to provide a name, username or e-mail address.
If you enable backups and data synchronization between your devices using iCloud, then Smart Tasks will transmit your tasks and categories to your personal iCloud digital storage that resides in the servers that are owned and operated by Apple. We will not share or transmit any of your tasks with any other third-party service. We do not have any of your tasks and do not transmit any of your tasks to any other service or server besides the iCloud servers as previously described above.
We may use third-party services in Smart Tasks in order to help us respond to support requests, detect and diagnose any potential issues and understand how Smart Tasks is used so that we can improve your overall experience. We never share any of your tasks with any of those services. Those third-party services may use and store anonymous aggregate data such as device characteristics, location data, version of Smart Tasks installed on your device, the OS version your device is running on and whether or not you have access to our premium features. If any of those services require your name or email address, for example in case you want to contact our support team, then those services will ask you explicitly to share this information.
