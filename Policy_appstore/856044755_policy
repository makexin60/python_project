These Services  include  all content  on the Site, and all interactions,  communications,  or other contact  in relation to coaching services, and all commercial purchases made through the Site.
This Policy is intended to help you understand the kind of information we may gather, the manner in which it is used or disclosed, and the reasonable efforts we make to protect that information.  Young and Raw reserves the right to change the Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the Site or to address  new issues.   These changes  may or may not be made with notice and it is your ongoing responsibility to monitor the terms of this Policy.  By visiting the Site or utilizing its Services you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy.   Each time you visit the Site or use its Services you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.   If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy you must immediately leave the Site and not use its Services.
2.   SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY:   This Policy applies to Young and Raw sites or services only.  It does not apply to your use of any website or third party whose links appear on the Site.  When you choose to link to a third party website the  applicable  terms  of that  website  will  control  your  privacy  rights.   Young  and  Raw  does  not review, approve, or endorse the terms of any third party website and has no control over how those sites use your personal information.
3.   PERSONAL  INFORMATION:     Information  collected  via  a  website  can  be  personal  (name, address,  credit  card  information)  or  non-personal  (cookies,  web  beacons,  IP  addresses).    Both personal and non-personal information is necessary for the proper administration of the Site, as well as providing the best possible product to the consumer.  With respect to personal information, Young and Raw will only collect the personal information you voluntarily submit.  We reasonably endeavor to ensure that we never intentionally  disclose  any personal  identification  information  to any third party without first receiving your permission.
In particular we offer a direct coaching program in which representatives from Young and Raw will communicate  directly with you regarding  dietary, health and nutritional  philosophies.   In addition, various products may be offered for sale on the Site, produced by both Young and Raw and other third parties.   In order to properly administer these Services it will be necessary for you to provide certain personal information including name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information, and other such personal data as may be necessary to properly complete the transaction.
In addition, the personal information you provide to us, may also be used in connection with cookies and web beacons (discussed below) to improve your experience while using the Site and its Services, including   remembering   your   preferences,   customizing   content   or   advertising   you   may   see. Occasionally we may email you products or additional services we think you may be interested in for marketing purposes.
4.   NON PERSONAL  INFORMATION,  COOKIES,  WEB BEACONS,  AND IP ADDRESS:  We collect the following  non-personal  information  without limitation:   i) “Cookies”:  A “cookie”  is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system, ii) “Internet  Protocol  Address”  or “IP Address”:  An “IP Address”  is a number  that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are on the Internet.  When you request pages from our Site, our servers log your IP address, iii) “Web Beacons”: A “web beacon” or “clear gif” is a small graphic image on a webpage or web-based document that a website uses to determine information  about a user.
These types of non-personal information are collected and used to improve the quality of use of the Site.   For example  cookies  can control the type of advertising  that is displayed  on your browser. Cookies and web beacons can track the date and time you used the Site, language preferences, and other data that help make the web navigation experience  easy and convenient.   We, or our service providers, may use your IP address when you access the Site to assist with delivery of geographically targeted advertisements.

These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), we advise that your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information or information is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal information for performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal information in question. If we collected your Personal Information with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.

* Complain to your local data protection authority at any time;
* Object to automated decision making; and
* Update your personal Information.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
If we ask you to provide Personal information to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your Personal information is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us.
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal information in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.
We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also take steps to minimize the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive or special categories of Personal information about you.
