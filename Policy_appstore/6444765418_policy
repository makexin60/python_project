1. Data Policy for Organisers of events and communities with ExpoPlatform
ExpoPlatform was founded by event professionals, for event professionals.
We believe in
Organiser controlled data
not
Vendor controlled data.
This means that
the Organiser is the sole controller of the customer user data (including visitor and exhibitor user data) and any intellectual property (such as content or products) shared on the platform. Read our
Data Manifesto
for more on this.
We give organisers full access to all types of data collected on our systems, making it easy to bring this into client’s database with APIs and data exports.
The types of data our policy applies to includes:
Type of data
How we treat it
Customer User data
The Organiser is the sole controller of all identifiable user data, including name, email address, demographic data, as well as the taxonomy that is used for the event.
ExpoPlatform has no control of this data, and cannot use it for any marketing purposes outside the wishes of the Organiser.
The Organiser can export all this data and remove it from our platform as they wish.
Content and intellectual property
The Organiser is the sole controller of all content shared within the platform, including presentations, news, on-demand content, exhibitor products and press releases. ExpoPlatform has no control of content, and cannot use it in any purposes without express permission by the Organiser.
Platform Usage data
ExpoPlatform and the Organiser are the co-controllers of the usage data generated by the platform.
This is anonymous data regarding clicks and behaviour of users, and is anonymised for the sole purpose of making improvements to the platform itself.
The full usage data can be exported by Organisers as required.
When we run events with an Organiser we will typically use their own
Data Protection Agreement (DPA)
and
Privacy Policy
, rather than our own (detailed below)

Also, we may provide various third parties (including Organisers) with anonymous aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 200 delegates of a specific category have participated in at least one meeting during the event). This data will not identify you as an individual.
5. Our Legal basis for Processing Your Data
The legal grounds for processing your personal data are as follows:
It is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you. Our Terms of Use sets out the basis of your use of the Services and the rules for using them.
It is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, except where our interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of affected individuals (such as you). To determine this, we shall consider a number of factors, such as what your expectations are about the processing of the data, the nature of the data, and the impact of the processing on you.
In some cases, your consent (such as where we seek your consent to send you details of our products and services by email).
It may be necessary for us to undertake processing in order to comply with mandatory legal obligations to which we are subject under EU or UK law.
6. Disclosure of your information
We may disclose some or all of the data we collect from you when you download or use ExpoPlatform’s services and applications to the following third parties:
Organiser Information – Organisers will receive activation data in respect of your email address – that is, whether or not you have successfully downloaded and registered on ExpoPlatform.
Social Information – Other users of ExpoPlatform.
We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
If ExpoPlatform or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request.
In order to:

protect the rights, property or safety of ExpoPlatform, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
7. How long will we retain your data?
We will not retain your personal data for longer than is necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data was collected or otherwise processed. The criteria we use for determining this period data will be any legal or regulatory requirements, statutory retention periods or guidance provided by regulatory bodies such as the Information Commissioners Office. For example, we delete any personally identifying Log Data when you disable your ExpoPlatform account, or 2 years after your last use of ExpoPlatform. We use this 2 year period because in our experience users may wish to retain an active ExpoPlatform registration to access information derived from the Services when they repeat attend the same event in another year. Some events are held on a biennial basis (every 2 years).
8. Security
We take security seriously and we use best industry practices to protect your data.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to or through ExpoPlatform or the Services; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
ExpoPlatform includes chat features. Ensure when using these features that you do not submit any personal data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
9. Automated Profiling
To assist us in providing an effective networking service, in addition to the data that you provide to us if you register, we may also obtain data from your usage of ExpoPlatform to help us understand what you might be interested in, or who you might be interested in connecting with. This ‘profiling’ activity is powered by some intelligence in our software which makes calculations about potential preferences or requirements you might have about what you see in the application or who we think you might wish to connect with. There’s no consequence for you of this profiling other than improvements to what we suggest to you in ExpoPlatform applications.
10. Marketing
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. we will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
