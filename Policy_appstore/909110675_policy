www.oceanhousemedia.com
,
www.committo3.com
,
www.beautyeverywhere.com
) are just for adults, while our apps are designed for the whole family, including young children with parent supervision. We take privacy seriously at Oceanhouse Media and this policy is designed to share what information we collect and how we use it.
 We last updated the contents of this policy on May 18th, 2018. Oceanhouse Media may change or update the Privacy Policy at any time as we add new or different features, or as the law changes. Unless another date is given, the changes are effective upon posting. If we make a material change to this policy we will post notice here. Thus, you should review the Privacy Policy frequently. This Privacy Policy is also part of the Terms of Service that explain your rights and responsibilities and Oceanhouse Media’s when using Oceanhouse Media’s services and sites.

Privacy
Advertising / Children
There are no third-party ads in our apps, but we do cross promote our other products. The only third party service providers we use in our apps are to support our internal operations and we do not collect anything that is personally identifiable in our apps for children.
Third Party Providers
To help us provide you with the best service, we work with third party analytics providers AppsFlyer and Facebook. Their respective Privacy Policies can be found at
https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/
and
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
These companies help us to understand your use of the apps and our webpages. In association with them, we may collect your unique device identifier and IP address. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to understand the functionality of the apps on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the apps, what happens within the apps, aggregated usage, performance data, app errors and debugging information, and where the apps were downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information that you submit within the mobile application.
Note: If you prefer that Facebook not have access to analytics data from our apps, please simply delete the Facebook app from your mobile device.
Also, for the purposes of managing user accounts and customer service, we work with third party service providers ActiveCampaign, Heroku and UserVoice. Their respective Privacy Policies can be found at
https://www.activecampaign.com/privacy-policy/
,
https://www.heroku.com/policy/security
and
https://www.uservoice.com/privacy/.
In association with them, we may collect and store information provided by you.
What Kind of Information is Collected?
There are two types of data that may be collected.
The first one is called
personal data
. This is personally identifiable information that identifies a user as an individual. Oceanhouse Media may collect personal data that adults voluntarily provide on the website(s), or by volunteering data via our apps. This may include first name, last name, username, email address, password and preferences.
The second type is
non-personal data
which doesn’t directly identify an individual or which may have been personal information, but has had the personally identifiable information removed. This may include technical data such as internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website or our apps. Oceanhouse Media may also collect non-personal information about the use of the website(s), products and apps to help us improve our services.
More About Personal Data
We collect personal data when a user subscribes to a newsletter or alert, submits content to a forum or blog, requests technical support, gives us feedback, sends an email through one of our apps or creates a user account. This data may include a name (screen or nickname), email address, mailing or shipping address and telephone number. This information may be used to provide services and the sites to you, information about new services & features and to send notifications if consent to receive them has been given.
More about Non-Personal Data
We may use cookies and web beacons to help deliver and analyze our services (e.g., by counting the number of times a page or advert has been viewed).
Automated Information
Oceanhouse Media automatically receives and records information from your browser or your mobile device when you visit our websites or use our apps or use certain other services, such as your IP address or unique device identifier, cookies and data about which pages you visit in order to allow us to operate and provide the Services. Some of this information is stored in log files and is collected automatically. We may combine this information from your browser or your mobile device with other information that we or our partners collect about you, including across devices. This information is used to provide advertising, including across your devices, and a more personalized experience for you.
We may also automatically collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our apps. This information may include information such as the hardware model, operating system information, app version, app usage and debugging information, browser information, IP address, and device identifiers.
Third parties or publicly available sources
We may receive Personal Data about you from various third parties and public sources including: Technical Data from analytics providers [such as Google based outside the EU] and our social media pages [such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn & Instagram].
A Word About What We Might Disclose
As you can see, we collect minimal personal data, and some non-personal data for internal use only or in conjunction with third parties to help us operate, analyze, and improve our sites and services. In addition, we may disclose your personal or non-personal information to additional parties if we believe we are required to by law, by a judicial proceeding, to protect Oceanhouse Media’s rights and properties, or to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringement, and any other conduct that might be illegal or expose Oceanhouse Media or a user of its services to legal liability. In addition, Oceanhouse Media may disclose information in the event of a change or proposed change in the ownership of the company; for example, a sale, a merger, or bankruptcy.
Tracking
We use Google Analytics Advertising Features to better understand the use of our website. We may use cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect information and help target advertising. We do not combine this information with any personally identifiable information you may have submitted when signing up to a newsletter for example. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals; but, you can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
. You can also configure your browser to accept or reject cookies. All browsers are different so go to the help section of your browser to find out how to do this.
Links
We may include links to third parties from our website or services. Oceanhouse Media isn’t responsible for these companies and including a link to them doesn’t mean that Oceanhouse Media endorses them. So be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them. And remember, your use of Oceanhouse Media’s sites and services may also be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of other services that Oceanhouse Media doesn’t control such as mobile application stores, mobile software platforms, online social media sites, or payment processors.
Promotional Offers From Us
We may use your Personal Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or received services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
Security
Oceanhouse Media uses generally accepted security measures and safeguards in an attempt to keep the data it collects secure and requires that the third parties it works with agree to do the same. The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for Oceanhouse Media, using a firewall protected environment, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said, Oceanhouse Media cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
Data Retention
Oceanhouse Media keeps your data for as long as necessary in providing its services.

We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
Collection of Information
The types of personal information that we collect will depend on the nature of your dealings with us.
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, engage with a chatbot on our website, fill out a form, make a purchase, participate in a contest or promotion, communicate with us via third party social media sites, interact with a message board, apply for a job, request customer support, use our platform or otherwise communicate with us.

Information We Derive
We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address. We may also infer information about your email and contact preferences based on how you respond to our communications with you, what information you find helpful, and what type of communication language most resonates with you.
Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to social media sites, credit bureaus, data enrichment providers, fraud prevention vendors and partners, and publicly available sources. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a third-party site, we may have access to certain information from that site, which could include information such as your name, account information, and other information you make available, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party site.
Integrations with Other Services
You may have the option of integrating our Services with other services, technologies or platforms on your desktop, permitted websites and/or your mobile phone. For example, we may offer you widgets that have countdowns to various launches as well as the opportunity to connect the Services with other third-party services that you use in your business. These integrations may require you to input information about you or result in the disclosure of information about you from the Services to a third party, or cause the Services to receive information about you from a third party with whom you instruct us to integrate. These integrations may (i) check for updates automatically and transmit your information to their server and/or engine; (ii) send information entered into or accessed by the technology to its server and/or engine; (iii) be visible to the public if embedded on publicly available webpages (such as social networking webpages); or (iv) transmit information about you to or from the Services, depending on the policies of that website. Please note that when you enable an integration between the Services and a third party, any information about you that is transmitted to a third party will be subject to the policies and procedures of that third party and not of ActiveCampaign.
Connecting Your Email Account
Should you choose to connect your email account to our platform, you will be using a set of features built using technology from Nylas, Inc. By signing up or using the Nylas application, you understand and agree that Nylas, Inc. and its affiliates who provide Nylas (“
Nylas
”), will have access to your information and will be permitted to use that information for specific, limited purposes to provide the Services to you, in accordance with our agreement with Nylas.  This integration is a completely optional service and is not required to use our platform.
Google OAuth:
You have the option of integrating aspects of your Google email metadata with your account through our integration with Nylas. We will ask for your consent to connect your Google account to your ActiveCampaign account. This step is optional but can very valuable in helping you to make the best use of our platform by tracking your interactions with your leads and customers.
When you connect your Google account with the ActiveCampaign platform through Nylas, we will have access to certain information such as the email meta headers (sender, recipient, and date), the email message body and subject line (“
Google Data
”).
We only process Google Data you make available to us through this integration in order to provide the Service to you and to improve the Services, consistent with
Google’s Limited Use Requirements
. We do not independently access the Google Data ourselves unless we first obtain your consent to view the Google Data (e.g., to provide you with tech support), we need to do so for internal security purposes, to comply with applicable law, or where the data is fully aggregated and anonymized for internal use purposes and cannot be used to identify you or your email recipients.
In addition, we will only transfer the Google Data to others if necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent in the Services, to comply with applicable laws, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. We also do not use Google Data for advertising purposes.
At any time, you can disconnect your Google account and delete this data in your account or by reaching out to

Privacy Policy
Last modified September 9, 2020
Updated references to EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles
Privacy Policy
Data Privacy Framework
GDPR Compliance
Introduction
This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices of UserVoice, which owns and operates various sites on the World Wide Web, including without limitation Uservoice.com, (collectively, the “UserVoice Websites”). Your access to and use of the UserVoice Websites and all the services provided via the UserVoice Websites (collectively, the “UserVoice Services”) are subject to UserVoice’s Terms of Use and all applicable laws.
This privacy policy describes how UserVoice collects, uses, and shares information about you that it obtains in connection with providing UserVoice Services to you.
We value your comments about our privacy statement and invite you to e-mail us with inquiries, suggestions and complaints at:
privacy@uservoice.com
.
What information is collected
In order to enhance your user experience and improve the UserVoice Services, UserVoice collects information about you from two sources: (i) information you affirmatively give to us; and (ii) information automatically collected when you visit any of the UserVoice Websites or use any UserVoice Services. Third parties may also collect your information in connection with your use of UserVoice Services.
‍
Information you give us
When you sign up for UserVoice Services, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself such as your name, email address, billing address, and company name or affiliation. You can view all of the information collected during the registration process by visiting the registration page. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features that will allow you to edit your profile and account information. Details on how to preform this action can be found
here
.
After you provide such information and set up your account, we may ask you to provide additional information about yourself on an optional basis. We may ask you for certain financial information, including credit card account data or other payment method data, to process payments for some of our services. UserVoice may collect any communication it has with you via any means, including e-mail, telephone, and letters.
By choosing to provide any information to us, you are giving UserVoice permission to use and store such information consistent with this privacy policy.
‍
Information we collect automatically
In addition, UserVoice automatically collects information about your interactions with the UserVoice Websites and UserVoice Services. For example, UserVoice may log information from your computer and browser, such as your IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, browser type, software and hardware attributes, pages you request, and cookie information. By using the UserVoice Services, you are giving UserVoice permission to use and store such information consistent with this privacy policy.
‍
Cookies
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.
‍
Information collected by third parties
UserVoice may use services that collect data remotely by using "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar technologies. Such technologies can recognize certain types of information on your web browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed them and the IP address of the computer from which you viewed them.
UserVoice Services may be linked to or provided through third party websites. UserVoice is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on such third party websites. When linking or accessing such websites, you should carefully review the privacy policy of such third party to determine how it handles information it separately collects from you.
‍
Term; Termination
The term of this Agreement shall be as set forth in a written agreement between the parties (the “
Term
”).  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the subscription term and the term of this Agreement shall automatically renew (the “
Automatic Renewal
”) on the first day following the end of the current subscription term (the “
Renewal Date
”).  Account Holder may cancel such Automatic Renewal by terminating the subscription and this Agreement as set forth herein or by providing written notice, at least 30 days prior to the Renewal Date, that Account Holder does not wish to renew the subscription.
Either Party may terminate this Agreement in the event that the other party breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. In the event that UserVoice terminates due to Account Holder’s breach, (a) Account Holder will remain liable for any amount due under this Agreement (adjusted on a pro rata basis, if applicable) and (b) UserVoice will destroy all Account Holder Data (defined below) in its possession after giving Account Holder a reasonable opportunity to download such data for a period of 60 days.
Account Holder may terminate this Agreement and its subscription to the Service by providing UserVoice with written notice of termination. In the event of any such termination, Account Holder will not be entitled to a refund of prepaid subscription fees; and UserVoice will destroy all Account Holder Data in its possession after giving Account Holder a reasonable opportunity to download such data for a period of 60 days.
‍
How information is used
UserVoice uses the information it collects from you to deliver UserVoice Services to you and continuously enhance your user experience. Generally speaking, we use the collected information to communicate with you, fulfill your requests, customize the content, improve our products and services, protect our and your rights, and comply with laws and regulations.
We may use your personal information to send you promotional information and updates regarding UserVoice and its products and services. You may choose not to receive such information and
opt-out of such future communications
. All such communications sent to you will also contain instructions for opting-out.
The information that we collect from you may be used in aggregate form in various ways to optimize and improve UserVoice Services. While such information may be based on information about you, it will not identify you personally. We may use such information for the following purposes: website management, administration and security, promotional activities, and research and analysis.
With whom information is shared
Public Information
UserVoice may share as it sees fit information that you voluntarily make public, including information that you post on any blogs, message boards, chat rooms or other similar forums, whether or not such forums are owned by UserVoice. Since such public information can be accessed by the public and used by any member of the public, such use by third parties is beyond the control of UserVoice.
‍
Personal Information
UserVoice may share your personal information that it collects (i) with its agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide UserVoice with support services to operate the UserVoice Services, including companies that assist with payment processing, business analytics, data processing, account management, and other services, (ii) if required by law or to protect the legal rights of UserVoice or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents and suppliers, (iii) to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, (iv) to protect the safety and security of users of the UserVoice Services or to enforce our Terms of Use or (v) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes. In the event that UserVoice shares your personal information pursuant to subsection (i) above, it will require such agents, representatives, contractors and/or service providers not to use your information for any purpose other than providing us with specific services that we have requested.
Note that if you sign up for service from one of our affiliates, we may ask for your consent to share with such third party partner certain of your personal information. While UserVoice is not responsible for the acts of such partners, we encourage all of our partners to adopt privacy policies that protect against the disclosure of personal information to third persons.
If you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by UserVoice or another user of the UserVoice Services, we may provide the information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. For instance, if you submit a notice of copyright infringement to us, we may send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication.
‍
Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Data
UserVoice may share with third parties your personal information and related aggregated data. For example, UserVoice may share IP addresses of its users to provide anonymous aggregated data to business partners about the volume of use on the UserVoice Services and the specific UserVoice Services in which users are most interested. Because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data.
‍
Change of Control
If UserVoice sells all or part of its business, or makes a sale or transfer of assets, or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, UserVoice may transfer your personal information and non-personal information to one or more third parties as part of such transaction.
How you can control the information we collect, use and share
You have the choice about whether to disclose your personal information or other information about yourself to UserVoice. Regardless of your choices with respect to promotional communications and updates regarding content, UserVoice may send you administrative messages, service announcements, terms and conditions of your account, or other similar communications, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
You can change your
privacy settings
at any time. You may
delete your UserVoice account
, in accordance with our Terms of Use. Please note that, if you cancel your account, UserVoice may retain some information about you but will discontinue posting such information on the UserVoice Websites.
How information is protected
Your UserVoice accounts may be secured by member-created passwords, in which case reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that your account information is kept private. You are responsible for keeping your passwords confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. UserVoice uses reasonable measures to protect your information stored within our databases, and we restrict access to such information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Despite these efforts, please note that we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of your information at any time.
Your European privacy rights
UserVoice is committed to compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). More information can be found at
https://www.uservoice.com/gdpr-compliance/
UserVoice complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. UserVoice has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.

UserVoice’s customers may continue to use our services, relying on UserVoice’s agreement to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses, which are included in our Data Processing Addendum.
