4. How to Control Your Information
4.1 Accessing and modifying your information
You can access and modify in your account profile the information you provided to us that is associated with your account directly within our services.
If you believe your information posted on LivChat is unauthentic or inaccurate and can provide us with reasonable proof regarding this, you can contact us via the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
4.2 Deleting your information
You can request an account deletion in LivChat settings at any time. Alternatively, you can also contact us directly to delete your account and information via the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. After you submit the request, it may take up to three days for us to verify and process the deletion of your account.
Once your account is closed or deleted, you will no longer have access to your message history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of our services. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Since LivChat will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.
4.3 Managing device permissions
You can change the system settings of your device to manage permissions for specific device data access as well as notifications. By doing so, you can stop LivChat from accessing your device data and displaying notifications. However, please keep in mind that this may cause certain services to lose functionality.
