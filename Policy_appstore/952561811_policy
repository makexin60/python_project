*Supplement
The third-party services are app distribution store operators (Apple for the App Store, Google for Google Play), and ad delivery operators. (For details, see
[2]
)
While app distribution store operators handle personal information, the use of our app does not mean that we can obtain personal information of the user.
Ad delivery operators may handle personal information in other services they provide, but the use of our app does not mean that we can obtain personal information of the user.
In other words, we do not obtain personal information from services operated by third parties.
The Advertising ID is a unique value on the device. If the user permits, it can span other services, and based on the information obtained from other services, we may customize and deliver ads in our app for you. You can change the Advertising ID at any time, and you can also opt out in the OS settings.

[3] How do we collect your data?
Our company collects your data when you use our smartphone app through communication over the internet between your device and our management server.
We may also indirectly receive your data from the third-party services listed in
[2].
For the handling of data, please refer to the privacy policy of each company. (For details about the third-party services, please refer to
[2].
)
[4] How will we use your data?
We collect your data so that we can:
Provide the features of our smartphone app
Maintain, protect, and improve our smartphone app
Check the usage status of our smartphone app
Respond to inquiries about our smartphone app
Respond to acts that violate our terms and other regulations regarding our smartphone app
Create statistical data about usage status
Deliver advertisements in our smartphone app
Understand the status of ad delivery and measure the effectiveness of ads
Plan, propose, and implement new services in the future
Provide some information to the third-party services that we use
*Supplement
We will not disclose your data without your consent. Data for rankings (scores and nicknames) and online matches (nicknames, ratings, etc.) are disclosed as they are intended to be seen by others. However, even in such cases, personal information will not be identified.
[5] How do we store your data?
The data handled by our smartphone app is stored as a data file in the app data area inside the device you use. Normally, access to this data file is not possible except by the app itself. (Of course, the OS can access it, and people who can use the device can also access it.) A part of the created data and the device information obtainable from the app are transmitted to our management server via encrypted communication (SSL), and stored on our management server.
Our management server utilizes a paid rental server provided within Japan. The location of the server is Japan. As the company providing the rental server is responsible for security, security measures are perfect.
The storage period of data on the management server is as long as the corresponding app is providing its service. For apps that have ended their service, the data will be deleted within one year.
As for the data within the device, all will be deleted when the app is uninstalled. However, data linked to the store's account (for example, non-consumable in-app purchases, backed-up app data) may be restored when the app is reinstalled.
The data provided to services operated by third parties will be handled according to their privacy policies.
*Supplement
In our smartphone app, most data is stored inside the device. For example, player data such as the progress of a game app is stored within the device. On our management server, we handle log data, such as user behavior history. However, in features such as ranking displays, user scores and the nicknames you set are stored on our management server.
Even if you uninstall the app, your data on our management server will not be deleted. This is because we cannot obtain information that the app has been uninstalled. If you wish to delete this, please refer to
[7]
.
[6] Marketing
We do not use the data we manage for marketing purposes.
However, the data provided to services operated by third parties may be used by those organizations.
