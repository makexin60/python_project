2. How We Collect Information
We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer support team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.
A. Cookies and Similar Technologies
Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.
We use also other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our products and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies." If you want to remove flash cookies or prevent them from being placed, adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. We may adopt a DNT standard if one is established. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings.
We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our products that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.
B. Analytics Technologies
We use our own servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.
For instance, SWEET NITRO may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to SWEET NITRO when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online services, SWEET NITRO also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.
Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with SWEET NITRO's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A representative list of third party analytics companies that operate in our products can be found at
Appendix
X.
C. Advertising Serving Technologies
Some of our products employ advertising serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products from SWEET NITRO SL or third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:
Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
Length of time an advertisement was visible;
Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and
Advertisement response.
Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Products and Services with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A representative list of advertising serving companies that operate their own networks on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at
Appendix
X.
To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit https://www.networkadvertising.org, https://www.aboutads.info/choices/, http://youradchoices.ca/, or https://www.youronlinechoices.eu. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.
D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies
SWEET NITRO strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our products, set up an SWEET NITRO Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.

Information We Share with Third Parties
We do not share personal information that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail or postal address) with independent third parties without your consent, unless it is either required by law or we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our rights, property or operations or to protect our players or third parties. We may share anonymous or aggregated information, or other data that does not directly identify you, with third parties, for instance your persona on leaderboards or to show trends about use of our products.
We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as conducting market surveys, facilitating credit card processing payment, debt collection agency, or sending emails. When our third party agents or service providers collect or receive personal information, we require that they use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.
We do not knowingly disclose personal information about children under 18 years of age to independent third parties even with consent.
However, in the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law.
We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity. When third party technologies or social tools are integrated into our products, those third parties may collect information when you use our games. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.
Where We Hold Your Information
Personal Information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy in the ANDORRA or any other country in which SWEET NITRO, its subsidiaries, or third party agents operate. By using our products, you consent that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the ANDORRA and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.
6. How We Protect Your Personal Information
Security of our players' information is a priority at SWEET NITRO, and we take a range of measures to help protect it. Even so, no security measure is 100% perfect. This means we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control. We process the information collected from you according to the European data protection law. All employees are obliged and have been advised to maintain data confidentiality and privacy obligations, and that received.
Duration of Storage, storage periods
We store your data only as long as this is necessary for the provision of our online offer and the associated services or we have a legitimate interest in the further storage. In all other cases, we will delete your personal information except for such information as we may need to maintain in order to fulfill contractual or statutory (e.g. tax or commercial) retention periods (e.g. invoices). Contractual retention periods may also arise from contracts with third parties (e.g. owners of copyrights and ancillary copyrights). Data that is subject to a retention period are saved until the expiration of the deadline.
Your Choices and Controls
We give you meaningful choices when it comes to important uses and collection of information. For example, you can update your account information and preferences, choose to opt in or out of SWEET NITRO marketing emails and choose whether to share your information with select SWEET NITRO partners. If you would like to opt out at any time after granting approval, use the provided controls within the product or contact us directly.
You may deactivate your SWEET NITRO Account or delete the personal information associated with your account by using the provided controls within the product or by contacting us directly. If you do so, you will no longer have access to the SWEET NITRO games or services associated with your account. Note that SWEET NITRO may retain information needed to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreements, protect our legal and tax rights, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our products. Otherwise, we will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide you services, create and improve our products, comply with the law, and to run our business.
You can access the personal information we hold about you. To request access, contact us directly. Before we process any request, we may ask you for certain personal information in order to verify your identity and we may request payment where allowed by law. Where permitted by local law, we may reject requests that are unreasonable or impractical. We will respond to your requests in a reasonable timeframe.
You have additionally, under certain conditions, the right to rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your personal data or have the right to object the processing. You also have the right for data portability. You can also object at any time to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes ("advertising conflict"). Please take into account that for organizational reasons there may be an overlap between your revocation and the use of your data as part of an ongoing campaign. If you have given us consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw them at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the revocation remains unaffected.
You can file a complaint with a data protection authority. You can contact the data protection authority, which is responsible for your place of residence or your state, or the data protection authority which is responsible for us. This is: Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht  (BayLDA), Promenade 27, D-91522 Ansbach, Germany,

Data Privacy Framework
Chartbeat and its subsidiary Tubular Labs, Inc. (“Tubular”) comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (“UK-U.S. DPF”), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) (collectively, the “DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Chartbeat and Tubular have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we they adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) and applicable principles under the UK-U.S. DPF (“UK-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK-U.S. DPF. Chartbeat and Tubular have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and the UK-U.S. DPF Principles, collectively, the “DPF Principles”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Chartbeat’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, and the purposes for which we disclose your Personal Data to certain types of third parties in the sections above. Pursuant to the DPF, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain Personal Data relating to you in the U.S. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the Personal Data that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the Personal Data we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the U.S. under DPF, should direct their query to privacy@chartbeat.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. This Privacy Policy has additional information about the rights afforded to you.
We will provide you with the choice to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Data, with any third parties (other than our agents or those that act on our behalf or under our instruction), or before we use it for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
In addition to any other disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, in certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Chartbeat’s accountability for Personal Data that we receive in the U.S. under the DPF and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, we remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agents process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Chartbeat proves that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Chartbeat commits to DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data.
