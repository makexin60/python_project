Email your questions to support@filimundus.se if you cannot find answers to your questions below.
What is the GDPR?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation common to all EU/EEA countries. It replaces the Personal Data Act (PuL). The aim of the new regulation is to harmonize and remove the differences that currently exist between EU countries. This means that companies operating in several markets within the EU will benefit from having a single set of rules to comply with. A regulation automatically becomes law in EU countries.
It also means better protection for each individual when we have a common EU regulation on how personal data can be processed. The rapid development of technology, which could not be predicted in the late 1990s when PuL entered into force, has been taken into account in the new regulation.
One of the novelties of the new regulation is that EU citizens will now have the right to require companies to delete their personal data after, for example, choosing to terminate their business with a company, provided it is not needed for the company to comply with other legal requirements.
Personal data is any information that can be used to identify an individual. For us at Filimundus AB, it is important that you feel safe with how we handle your personal data. We protect the information you entrust to us and comply with the laws and regulations that exist to protect your privacy.
