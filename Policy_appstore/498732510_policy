Privacy policy
Effective date October 16th, 2024
1. General Information
We understand that protecting your privacy is important to you, and therefore, protecting your data is very important to us. We, Eifrig Media GmbH, Neumann-Reichardt-Str. 27, 22041 Hamburg, are committed to complying with the applicable data protection regulations in each respective country, especially the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Below, we provide you with clear information on what data we occasionally collect in connection with the provided apps Blitzer.de (iOS & Android), CamSam (iOS & Android), Blitzer.de & CamSam PLUS (Android), Blitzer.de & CamSam PRO (iOS), the Blitzer.de website, and the related services.
It is important for us to emphasize that we collect data sparingly and only where it is absolutely necessary and enables personalized services. This information helps us to ensure our offerings in the short term and, building upon that, to optimize and expand them in the long term to your benefit.
We would like to explain below the scope and clearly defined and lawful purposes for which this data may be collected or actively entered by you, how long it may be stored, and who may use it. We also explain how you can view, manage, or request the deletion of the collected data.
We assure you that we will only use your data for the purposes outlined here and agreed upon with you. We take all necessary organizational and technical measures to protect it from unauthorized access, accidental loss, unlawful destruction, or unauthorized disclosure. To do this, we regularly review our data collection, storage, and processing measures. It is important to us to detect security threats quickly and to counter them immediately, manually or even automatically, so that you are not confronted with them in the first place.
Data processing is carried out exclusively based on one or more possible legal grounds. According to the GDPR, personal data can be processed based on a contract and for its fulfillment.
Of particular relevance in terms of data protection are so-called “personal data.” “Personal data” refers to any information about an identified or identifiable natural person. Persons are identifiable if, based on information such as a name, user ID, or location information, a direct or indirect identification of the person can occur (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR). Anonymized data is not included, as no identification can take place. How we anonymize your data is explained below.
We may change this privacy policy at any time and publish a revised version on this page. For significant changes, we will notify you with a prominent notice in the apps.
2. Permissions for Accessing Information from the Smartphone
Our app only requests access permissions that are directly necessary for its correct functionality. To provide you with our services, the app must know your location. This is only possible if you allow the app to access your location. During app use, we regularly receive your current location from your smartphone’s location services. This is the only way we can give you useful traffic alerts about upcoming hazards, based on your current location, while in driving mode.
In addition to location information, an anonymous identifier (Session ID) is transmitted to us. This information helps us associate the data sent to and from the smartphone. This identifier neither provides us with information about you personally, nor does it give us access to the data on your smartphone.
Additionally, the app requires several other permissions for functionality, but these are not relevant to data protection. You can find an overview of the permissions here for iOS and here for Android.
3. Anonymization and Use of Anonymized Location Data
While using the app, and only during that time, status data about your drive is recorded. This includes your location, as well as detailed speed values, driving directions, and usage times of the app. Collectively, this data is referred to as “FCD (floating car data/vehicle movement data).”
The status data is compiled and aggregated in a database, exclusively in anonymized, non-personalized form. In particular, the aggregated form prevents any conclusions from being drawn about individual users. These anonymized or aggregated data are permanently deleted after 48 hours. We never create user profiles based on the status data known to us without your consent.
In the app settings under the General menu, the “FCD” option can be deactivated. If deactivated, no status data from your drive will be transmitted to us.
When reporting new hazards, the type of hazard you selected, your reported speed at the time, your location, the time of the report, and the anonymous identifier are sent to our servers.
4. Internal and External Data Processing
Selected personal data may be shared within the company with specific departments to ensure our service provision. This includes IT, accounting, support, product management, traffic editorial, and marketing.
If authorized service providers act on our behalf for the development, provision, and improvement of our services, Eifrig Media only selects those whose technical measures and organizational security practices provide sufficient guarantees for data protection according to our standards.
These authorized service providers act under a contractual obligation to comply with agreed-upon data protection measures and the strict requirements of the GDPR (in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR). EM regularly checks compliance personally. The processors we use provide the following services: hosting, development, and maintenance.
The external service providers that contribute to the functionality of the apps include:
Blitzer.de PRO (iOS): atudo GmbH (infrastructure), Firebase Crashlytics (crash analysis), Telenav, Inc. (map provider)
Blitzer.de/CamSam PLUS (Android): atudo GmbH (infrastructure), Firebase Crashlytics (crash analysis), AWS (telemetry)
Blitzer.de/CamSam (Android): atudo GmbH (infrastructure), Firebase Crashlytics (crash analysis), AWS (telemetry), PACE Telematics GmbH (connected fueling)
5. Registration and Personal Data
To allow you the most anonymous use of our apps, registration is not possible or necessary.
On the website, voluntary registration is possible to assign the uploaded information and images to a user. If registration is completed, you as the user actively leave personal data. This includes the mandatory information:
a username
an email address
a freely chosen password
Additional personal data that may be actively and voluntarily entered by the user during website use, with or without registration, may include:
first and last name
license plate number
In your user account, you can manage and keep your data up to date. To delete your account, a brief message to info@blitzer.de is sufficient.
The scope of the stored data depends on the extent and type of your use. Personal data is only stored as long as necessary, i.e., as long as the purpose of use is maintained and we are authorized to do so.
You can also help protect your data. We recommend choosing a password for your user account that only you know. It is also up to you to protect your account. Please regularly change your password. If you suspect that unauthorized individuals have gained knowledge of the password, it is your responsibility to change it immediately.
Your email address will never be used for advertising purposes, only for information about your user status or other important information regarding the website.
Personal data will never be sold or made accessible to unauthorized third parties.
6. General Information on App Usage
Anonymous data about the device on which the app is installed and app usage is collected. The data related to the device is limited to the device name and the operating system version, which help us analyze any potential errors.
To calculate the number of currently active users and track user numbers, app usage time is stored for 48 hours.
For data transmission over the internet, the IP address of the device is transmitted to us. This is the only way to display a website on your device. The IP address is shortened before processing and further handled in an anonymized form. The unshortened, non-anonymous IP address is never stored.
7. Data from Other Sources
If you download the app from an app store, we process the data provided by the app store to the extent necessary to fulfill the contract from our side, allowing the download onto the mobile device.
8. Age Restriction
The apps from EM are aimed at drivers, meaning individuals aged 17 and older. Persons under 16 are not allowed to use the app for data protection reasons. If we are informed of the website’s use by a person under 16, the corresponding user profile will be deleted immediately.
9. Right to Information
You have the right to request information about stored personal, non-anonymized data at any time. Our data protection officer will gladly answer any questions or comments regarding data protection at
datenschutz@blitzer.de
