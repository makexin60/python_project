At PASCO, customers always come first. We recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you is dependent on our ability to create and maintain a foundation of trust. This is why we have a firm commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy.
We've structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit PASCO online, without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Website visitors that are 18 years of age or older may choose to provide their personal information (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) with the assurance that it will only be used to support your customer experience with PASCO. PASCO offers educational products and services to educational professionals and institutions. PASCO products and services are not intended for direct purchase by individuals under the age of 18. As such, we
do not
market our products and services to individuals under 18 years of age, nor do we seek or collect any information from them.
What Information We Collect
We collect only the minimal amount of information needed to deliver our products and services.
On some PASCO websites, you can order products or services, download software updates, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected on these pages include name, e-mail address, contact and billing information, transaction information, and/or credit card information.
In order for us to tailor subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. Data collected online may be combined with the information you provide when registering PASCO products. Personal information can be updated each time you place an order or obtain a quote from the online PASCO store.
We also use website logging/analysis software to track how PASCO visitors navigate through the site. This site log, commonly called a 'hit' log, allows PASCO to determine which PASCO website pages are the most popular. The log contains
no personal information
, only a listing of website addresses visited by PASCO customers in general.
How We Use the Information
PASCO uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on services and benefits, and to personalize our websites based on your needs. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are
not
retained for other purposes.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact.
Whom We Share the Information With
PASCO will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others. Unless you tell us otherwise or law prevents us, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other PASCO entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above.

This information is available for review upon request. All current and future version e-book download users are assigned an anonymous identification number without any personally identifiable information associated with it.
In regards to software application crashes, the software will request that the user send a crash report to PASCO. The crash reporting is optional. If the user elects to send the report, it is sent to PASCO via email. The email will contain the email address of the sender. For more information, see our

Our software applications and mobile apps do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to PASCO or any third parties. In cases of application crashes, users may voluntarily submit crash reports to a third party server hosted by BugSplat, LLC. The BugSplat, LLC privacy statement is
here
. In these cases the information is only used internal to PASCO to diagnose and fix the cause of the crash. The crash report is not used or distributed outside of our Software and Technical Support departments for any reason.
How does PASCO Application Software Comply?
PASCO scientific application software including Capstone, SPARKvue, MatchGraph!, and Spectrometry, does not collect, transmit to PASCO, nor store any personal identifiable information except in the limited circumstances noted below. This is true of the applications regardless of the platform on which they are run which include Windows, Mac OSX, iOS, Android, Chromebook, or ChromeOS. PASCO applications never display any advertisements to users.
Limited Circumstances
Application Crashes:
From time to time, if an application crashes, the software will request that the user send a crash report to PASCO. If the user elects to send the report, it is sent to PASCO via email. The email will contain the email address of the sender. The crash report contains the computer name, the logged-in username, and the internal LAN IP address of the computer. This information is used internal to PASCO strictly to diagnose and fix the cause of the application crash. The data is never distributed in any way outside of the PASCO Software and Technical Support departments. The user may elect to not send the report in which case none of the information is ever transmitted to PASCO.
Shared Sessions:
SPARKvue allows multiple users to connect their SPARKvue applications together to share experiment data and results via the Shared Sessions feature. The Shared Session utilizes a PASCO server to link the applications. While the user entered screen names are shared in the session, no personal identifiable information is transmitted to nor stored on the PASCO server. When the Shared Session is terminated, neither the user names nor any information from the session is kept or stored on the PASCO server.
Google Analytics:
The SPARKvue and PASCO Capstone applications also collect usage data via Google Analytics. This data is used strictly to report usage of certain features in the applications. The applications do not collect, transmit, nor store any user personally identifiable information on the PASCO server. Users may opt out of analytics collection.
This Privacy Policy is Subject to Change
PASCO reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time to ensure that it complies with all current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy statement.
Questions/Complaints:
If you ever have any questions about our online privacy policy, please contact us. We respect your rights and privacy, and will be happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have.

PASCO Website
The PASCO website displays YouTube videos in Privacy-enhanced mode. Briefly, the privacy-enhanced mode is Google's way to provide YouTube videos in a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant way, without sending data-collecting cookies. From Google:
"Privacy-enhanced mode allows you to embed YouTube videos without using cookies to track viewing behavior. This means that viewing activity isn't collected to personalize the viewing experience. Instead, video recommendations are contextual and related to the currently played video. Videos playing in a privacy-enhanced mode embedded player won't influence the viewer's browsing experience on YouTube."
In regards to Student Privacy, the Privacy-enhanced mode also prevents data-collecting cookies from collecting any personally identifiable student information.
Software & Curriculum
PASCO will mark as “Made for Kids” all videos served by YouTube that are embedded or linked to within software and curriculum products that are served to students. The “Made for Kids” marking allows the videos to comply with the various on-line student privacy laws.
