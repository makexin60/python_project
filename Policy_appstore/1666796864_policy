We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
Information about why we process the above personal data and the lawful basis we rely on is set out in sections 6 and 7 below.

you make any enquiry or complaint;

you participate in competitions, surveys and questionnaires or provide us with a review or feedback; or
you provide data for other legal and regulatory purposes.
We may also automatically collect certain Technical Data (as defined in section 4 above) relating to your device and your activities on the App. We may also collect such data from third parties such as analytics providers (including Amplitude Identifier).
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of an agreement we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested (or fail to consent to the processing of that data, if necessary), we may not be able to perform the agreement or arrangement we have or are trying to enter into with you or such failure may limit or prevent you obtaining access to our products and services.
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We use your personal data for a number of purposes but only where we're allowed to by law.
We may process your personal data where such processing is necessary or permitted:
where you have consented before the processing;
where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter or have entered into with you (including our App Terms of Use and/or Subscription Terms);
for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party. These legitimate interests include the purposes identified in the table below in section 7 but may also include other commercial interests and our internal administrative purposes. Where we rely on legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing your personal data, we'll put in place appropriate safeguards to protect your data and to ensure that your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden by those legitimate interests; and/or
where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Where we rely on consent as the lawful basis for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and if you wish to do so, you should contact us using the contact details set out in section 14 below. Where we obtain your consent to send you marketing communications, you can unsubscribe by following the unsubscribe link within the communication. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal or the lawfulness of processing based on other lawful grounds.
We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences (including terrorist offences and fraudulent activity).
We may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we're using your data.
We may process your personal data ourselves or in conjunction with our third-party service providers in accordance with section 8.
We'll only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we'll notify you (which may be by way of update to this privacy notice) and we'll explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.

We ensure that any third party engaged by us who processes your personal data in connection with the purposes listed above has policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws.
For any third parties that are based, or process data, outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom, we engage such third parties in accordance with section 9 below.
We'll remain the controller responsible for the processing of your personal data even if a third party may operate as a joint controller with us. For some processing activities we may act as a processor for a third party and, in such circumstances, the third party will be responsible for providing you with the processing information required under data protection laws.
We may share your personal data with third parties where we're required to do so by law or regulation (such as in connection with an investigation of fraud or other legal enquiry) or in connection with other legal proceedings (including where we believe that your actions violate applicable laws or any agreement with us including our App Terms of Use).

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
From time to time it may be necessary for us to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information may be transferred to and/or stored on the servers of third parties identified in section 8 which are based outside of the UK or the EEA.
However, we won't transfer your personal data outside of the UK or the EEA unless:
such transfer is to a country or jurisdiction which the EU Commission or the UK (as applicable) has approved as having an adequate level of protection;
appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with data protection laws. These safeguards include the use of standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules; or
the transfer is otherwise allowed under data protection laws (including where we have consent or the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest, is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject).
We'll ensure that where your personal data is transferred outside of the UK or the EEA, it is afforded on essentially equivalent level of protection as would be afforded to it within the EEA or UK.
HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
As a minimum, we need to store your personal data for as long as is necessary to enable us to fulfil the purpose for which it is processed, including to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. relating to record keeping) and to exercise or defend any legal claims.
For as long as we do store your data, we follow generally accepted industry standards and maintain reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the information you have provided. All information you provide to us is stored on Amazon's web servers.
It is important that you keep secure and confidential any login credentials that you have for the App. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of such login credentials.  You should notify us immediately if you become aware that the security or confidentiality of your login credentials is compromised.
We'll notify you without undue delay in accordance with the requirements of data protection laws, if we have reason to believe that there has been a personal data breach by us which could adversely affect your rights and freedoms and we're required by law to notify you.
We maintain and implement a data retention policy and will delete personal data in accordance with this.  We will delete personal dates on the earlier of the date when you delete your account or after five (5) years or inactivity.
