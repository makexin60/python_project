USERS accept and agree that the information collected on the PLATFORM will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this instrument.
In order to ensure clear and precise rules on the operation of the PLATFORM, MR ROCCO may amend this instrument at any time by publishing a revised version on the PLATFORM. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you always visit this section of the PLATFORM and read it periodically. However, in order to contribute to a good relationship, we will also send the USER an e-mail informing them of these changes, so that they have entered their e-mail address in the PLATFORM.
This policy will let you know:
What we collect and how we use the data;
Users’ rights to delete or correct information;
How do we use and protect your information?
International Data Sharing and Transfer; and
Who to contact if you have any questions.
_________
What we collect and how we use the data:
– Registration
When the USER registers on the PLATFORM, MR ROCCO collects their name and e-mail address for the purpose of using and accessing the PLATFORM. Thus, there is a legal basis for consent and a legitimate interest in processing personal data.
– Unique device ID and Registration
When the USER accesses the PLATFORM, MR ROCCO collects their Unique Device ID (UDID) and/or their IP address. The information is collected to determine the number of unique devices accessing the PLATFORM services, monitor the use of PLATFORM products and functionalities, analyze data and improve the communication and experience with the USER. MR ROCCO combines this information with other tools to provide a better and more personalized experience for USERS, as well as to improve the quality of our services.
It is not necessary to register or log in to use the PLATFORM. However, when a USER creates an account, they can access translations of the biblical text and specific tools within the PLATFORM.
The legal basis used here is for compliance with a legal obligation and legitimate interest.
– Mr Rocco Internet Cookies
When the USER accesses the PLATFORM, MR ROCCO does not use information from cookies (a cookie is a text file whose main function is to store the USER’s preferences about a particular website).
MR ROCCO may use cookies to track and store information about the USER’s browsing habits, so that MR ROCCO can offer more personalized services and opportunities to the USER. This also makes it possible to offer specific content and advertising for each USER, benefiting the user experience on the Internet.
Cookies will be used so that MR ROCCO can offer differentiated services, with a view to gauging the USER’s browsing habits. When the USER accesses the PLATFORM, MR ROCCO will be able to identify, through Google Analytics software (https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/br/), the different ways in which the USER accesses and visits the PLATFORM.
It is up to the USER to inform and register their e-mail address and other pertinent information in order to receive news recently published by MR ROCCO. This type of sending of content or any other form of contact via e-mail address will only be carried out by providing the necessary data. Once the USER has provided the data, they authorize MR ROCCO to send them content.
The legal basis used here is for compliance with a legal obligation and legitimate interest.
– Communication
Personal information or requests that USERS submit via the PLATFORM are sent to MR ROCCO’s administrator group. The administrator group and/or one of its members will have access to the information and will store it in order to respond to requests and improve the PLATFORM’s services.
MR ROCCO reserves the right to provide this USER data and information, as well as the entire system used on the PLATFORM, to its team, which may be made up of MR ROCCO employees and/or a third-party company, who will be responsible for managing the security and reliability of the PLATFORM and USER data.
All members of the MR ROCCO team, whether employees or contractors, will sign a confidentiality agreement stating that they undertake to keep all information about USERS revealed as a result of using the PLATFORM strictly confidential.
The legal basis used here is consent and legitimate interest.
– Permissions to access device information and GPS location:
MR ROCCO requests permission from USERS to access the following information: (i) photo gallery; (ii) device GPS location; (iii) camera; (iv) contacts; (v) device storage. MR ROCCO uses this type of information to offer a more personalized experience on the PLATFORM. MR ROCCO combines this type of information with third-party tools to also improve the quality of the services provided. For example, when a USER consults the Nearby Churches and Events tool, the PLATFORM needs their location and combines this data with information recorded on Google Maps. It should be noted that MR ROCCO does not share any personally identifiable location or device information without the express permission of the USER.
The legal basis used here is consent and legitimate interest. 1.1 Specific consent for processing sensitive personal data:
FOR “EVANGELIZE”, MR ROCCO PROCESSES DATA WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE USER’S RELIGION:
(i) WHAT IS YOUR RELIGION? (ii) HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THIS RELIGION? (iii) DO YOU WANT TO USE SALT TO EVANGELIZE? (iv) WHICH CHURCH DO YOU BELONG TO?
IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE, USERS ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED AND PROCESSED ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT, AT THE USER’S SOLE DISCRETION, THEY PROVIDE THEIR RELIGIOUS DATA VIA THE PLATFORM.
MR ROCCO CLARIFIES THAT FAILURE BY THE USER TO FILL IN INFORMATION WITH A RELIGIOUS CONTENT WILL NOT RESTRICT THE USER’S ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM’S FUNCTIONALITIES.
IF THE USER PROVIDES MR ROCCO WITH DATA RELATING TO THEIR RELIGION, THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY CONSENTING TO THIS DATA PROCESSING.
MR ROCCO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ITEM (1.1.) FOR THE PURPOSE OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROFILE OF THE USERS OF THE PLATFORM WITH THE PURPOSE OF PERSONALIZING, CUSTOMIZING AND OPTIMIZING THE EXPERIENCE AND FUNCTIONALITIES MADE AVAILABLE BY MR ROCCO. MR ROCCO MAY OFFER EXCLUSIVE TOOLS TO USERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN USING THE PLATFORM TO “EVANGELIZE”.
THEREFORE, IN THE EVENT THAT THE USER INFORMS MR ROCCO THAT HE/SHE WILL BE USING THE PLATFORM TO ASSIST IN THE “EVANGELIZE” PROCESS, MR ROCCO MAY CONTACT THE USER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION.
Users’ rights to delete or correct information
– Data deletion:
The USER may request MR ROCCO to delete some or all of their personal information. This type of request may restrict the USER’s use of certain features on the PLATFORM.
The request to delete the data provided for in item 1.1. of this instrument will not restrict access to the features widely available on the PLATFORM, but may only limit the use of exclusive tools to assist the PLATFORM in the evangelization process.
The USER can delete his or her information through the account removal button, available on the profile screen within the PLATFORM, according to the
LINK
.
By requesting or deleting an account, all the USER’s data will be permanently and irreversibly deleted from the PLATFORM.
– Correction:
The USER can edit part of his/her personal information stored on the PLATFORM, including removing account and changing name, e-mail and photo according to the
LINK
, or ask MR ROCCO to make any correction or update.
– Limit or restrict the use of data:
The USER may request that MR ROCCO cease processing their personal data (for example, if we do not have the legal right to continue using it) or limit its use (for example, if their personal data is inaccurate or held unlawfully).
– Right to access and/or request your data:
The USER may request from MR ROCCO a copy of their personal data that has been provided via the PLATFORM.
– Right to review automated decisions:
The USER may request information on decisions made on the PLATFORM based on the DATA PROCESSING carried out.
– Right to data portability:
The USER may request from MR ROCCO a copy of their personal data in electronic form, and may also transmit this data for use in third-party services.

.
Use of the PLATFORM may include various features, such as: Bible reading plans, bookmarks, highlighting of certain parts of scripture, annotations, searching the Bible based on keywords, use of images to make montages with Bible verses. Unless you have included personally identifiable information in content created with these features (such as a personal image or address or first and last name), MR ROCCCO reserves the right to retain that information, including inferences made from that information after an account has been deleted. For example, while we will delete a user’s email address when their account is deleted, we will retain and reserve the right to use and share which Bible verses were shared, highlighted, etc. by the USER in a way that does not personally identify them. The fact that this USER has downloaded the PLATFORM means that we keep him/her in our total count of applications downloaded from the PLATFORM, even though we have deleted the personal information associated with this USER’s account in the MR ROCCO system.
MR ROCCO has no control over information shared with other people via the PLATFORM. Therefore, the USER understands that it is not MR ROCCO’s responsibility to delete his/her information that is deposited in a third-party database.
How do we use and protect your information?
When MR ROCCO shares statistics about USERS’ involvement in the PLATFORM, the data is analyzed in order to protect the USER’s privacy. When this information is published, it is only in an aggregated form that does not disclose personal information in an identifiable form.  In addition, MR ROCCO protects all of the USER’s personal data using technically and economically reasonable standards of care considering current Internet technology. The USER acknowledges that there can be no expectation of total security on the Internet against hacking of websites or other irregular acts.
Even if MR ROCCO chooses the world’s leading data security service providers, MR ROCCO disclaims liability for any possible hacker attack or failure of security technologies that could lead to this information being exposed.
MR ROCCO does not share any personally identifiable information with third parties in association with the unique device ID without the explicit consent of the USERS.
International Data Sharing and Transfer
The PLATFORM is offered in and from São Paulo, Brazil, to other parts of the world. Therefore, your use of the PLATFORM and this Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Brazil and the State of São Paulo. If the USER uses the PLATFORM outside Brazil, he/she must accept that his/her information may be transferred, stored and processed in Brazil, where MR ROCCO’s servers are located and from where the central database is operated.
MR ROCCO processes data inside and outside Brazil and relies on legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. This includes contractual commitments between MR ROCCO and companies transferring personal data that require protection and security of such data. The data protection and other laws of the State of São Paulo, Brazil and other countries may not be as comprehensive as those of your country. By using the PLATFORM, the USER consents to his/her information being transferred to MR ROCCO’s facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it, as described in this Privacy Policy.

MR ROCCO is not authorized to provide the data registered by the USER to third parties, except in the manner provided for herein.
