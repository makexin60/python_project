Privacy Policy
This privacy policy contains all the information applicable to the treatment
  of personal data collected on the
website
or through other alternative means used to contact LUGGit.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party products and services or
  third-party websites that can be accessed through the links on our website for
  the user's convenience and/or information. Regarding access to third party
  links, you should consult our Terms and Conditions in advance.
1. Responsible for the Treatment of Personal Data
Bus Terrace Technologies, SA., collective person No. 515274003, with
  headquarters in Via do Conhecimento, Edif√≠cio Central, Parque da Ci√™ncia e
  Inova√ß√£o, 3830-352 √çlhavo, Aveiro, Portugal, represented by Ricardo Figueiredo
  and Diogo Correia as administrators.
E-mail:
hello@luggit.app
Within our organisation, the contact person with whom you can clarify your
  doubts in this field and, as well, exercise the rights that are recognised to
  you, whenever you feel this need, is Jo√£o Pedro Pedrosa through the following
  email contact:
dataprotection@luggit.app
or postal mail to the address of our headquarters under the care of Jo√£o Pedro
  Pedrosa.
2. Principles followed by the Responsible, Security and Protection of
    Personal Data
According to the law, the processing of personal data is done based on the
  lawfulness, loyalty, justice, transparency, limitation of purposes,
  minimisation of data, and accuracy. Thus, to protect your data against
  unauthorised use and disclosure, LUGGit has implemented several security
  measures.
As Responsible for Processing, LUGGit processes your personal data lawfully,
  always collecting your free, specific, informed and explicit consent whenever
  required under the law. LUGGit does not use/transmit your data for purposes
  incompatible with the Principles set out above. The purpose(s) for which your
  data is collected is(are) solely, and exclusively the one(s) described here.
  To that extent, your data will not be treated for any other purpose unless
  such treatment has previously been consented to by you.
The collection of personal data is carried out based on the Principle of
  Minimization. LUGGit only collects data considered essential for the pursuit
  of the purpose in question.
As soon as the data collected is no longer necessary for the purpose for which
  it was collected, LUGGit will refrain from continuing to process it and will
  take all measures required for its destruction.
3. Information and consent
Law No. 58/2019, of August 8, 2019 (which ensures the implementation, in the
  national legal order, of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Parliament and of the
  Council, of April 27, 2016) and Regulation General Data Protection Act
  (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
  April 27 2016, from now on ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) ensure the protection of natural persons
  concerning the processing of personal data and the free circulation of that
  data.
Under the legal terms, "personal data" means any information of any nature and
  regardless of its support, including sound and image, relating to an
  identified or identifiable natural person, so the protection does not cover
  the data of legal persons.
Upon acceptance of this Privacy Policy, the User gives his/her informed,
  express, free and unambiguous consent so that the personal data provided
  through the website are included in a file under the responsibility of LUGGit,
  whose treatment complies with the technical and organisational security
  measures appropriate.
LUGGit maintains a database with the registration of its Users. The data
  present in this database are only the data provided by them at the time of
  registration (as a Client, Keeper or Partner), being collected and processed
  automatically, under the terms approved by the National Data Protection
  Commission by LUGGit, the entity responsible for the corresponding file.
In any case, will be requested information about philosophical or political
  beliefs, party or union affiliation, religious faith, private life and racial
  or ethnic origin, and health and sexual life data, including genetic data.
In no case will any of the following activities be carried out with the
  personal data provided through this page:
Handing over the data to other persons or other entities, without the prior
    consent of the data subject;
Transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) without the prior
    consent of the data subject.
4. Personal data collected and Purposes
The personal data collected on the web page depends on the interaction that
  the User had on it. Suppose the customer wants to schedule a LUGGit service or
  collaborate with LUGGit, as a Keeper or Partner. In that case, the personal
  data collected are those requested in the forms in question, and where it is
  understood:
Identification Data: Name (first and last);
Contact Details (email and phone number).
Subsequently, depending on the type of interaction, the LUGGit team may
  request other data to formalise the process and conclusion of the respective
  contract or partnership agreement.
The personal data processed through this page will only be used for the
  following purposes:
Service scheduled by Clients;
Pre-registration on the page and expression of interest in collaborating
    with LUGGit, as Keeper or Partner;
Analysis of the application with a view to the collaboration of the User as
    Keeper or Partner of LUGGit, if they fulfil the required requirements;
Communication with Users and clarification of doubts;
Processing of information requests;
Complaints processing;
Statistical analysis activities;
Monitor, maintain and develop systems and statistical analysis;
Direct marketing communications, namely the newsletter (if the User has
    consented to the processing of their data);
Request for comments on services provided by LUGGit;
Conducting satisfaction surveys.
LUGGit guarantees the confidentiality of all data provided by Users at any
  time and regardless of the means used for that purpose. Nevertheless, LUGGit
  proceeds to the collection and processing of data in a safe way and that
  prevents its loss or manipulation; using the most improved techniques for this
  purpose, it is informed that the collection in an open network allows the
  circulation of personal data without security conditions, at the risk of being
  seen and used by unauthorised third parties.
The website has a chat available 24 hours a day, in which Users can ask the
  questions they want if they do not find the answers on our page. However, if
  the Users provide personal data to LUGGit through chat or even through other
  forms of contact, they will not be used for any purpose other than what is
  requested by the User.
Thus, if the User, after any clarification, wants to become a Customer of the
  service or collaborate as a Partner or Keeper, for example, he will have to
  fill out the forms available on the website for that purpose, and any personal
  data that another way may have provided will be disregarded.
When collecting personal data, except in fields where otherwise indicated, the
  User may voluntarily make personal data available, without the lack of
  response implying a decrease in the quality or quantity of the corresponding
  services (unless it is otherwise indicated). However, the absence of response
  to the data, considered mandatory, will imply the impossibility of accessing
  the service for which the data was requested.
If you disagree with the conditions mentioned above, LUGGit will not contact
  the User through its website.
If you come to interact with LUGGit social networks in particular, please be
  aware that we collect personally identifiable data and any other information
  that you provide when interacting with us. Each of the aforementioned social
  networks has its privacy policies, which LUGGit is unrelated to. For this
  reason, the User, from the moment he decides to interact through these
  channels, is the only and exclusively responsible for what the prior
  consultation is advisable for such documents.
5. Period of retention of personal data
The period of retention of data varies according to the purpose for which the
  information is processed.
Personal data collected based on consent are kept for five years from the last
  date on which your permission was obtained unless previously requested by the
  respective holder to be deleted.
The data collected based on pre-contractual diligence and execution of the
  service provision contract will be kept until the contract is in force. Due to
  legal imposition or compliance with a legal obligation, the processing is
  necessary for a legal obligation time more extended.
At any time, you may cancel periodic direct communications previously
  consented to by LUGGit and stop receiving them. To do so, just in the
  communications you receive, click on the option ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù, as a rule,
  available in them.
6. Treatment of Minors' Personal Data
As a rule, data is not collected or processed, by any means, under the age of
  18. If, for any circumstance, this occurs, know that the treatment is only
  lawful if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holders
  of parental responsibilities.
In that case, LUGGit will make every effort to verify that consent has been
  given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility, taking into
  account the available technology.
7. Transmission of Data to Third Parties
Personal data collected from your interaction will not be transmitted to third
  parties other than LUGGit unless legally imposed or by an investigation by the
  competent authorities.
Concerning the data of the Users, considered as Client, Keepers or Partners,
  these, for the execution of the respective contract, may be transmitted to
  third parties subcontracted by LUGGit, which will, in due course, be known by
  the respective owners.
Please note that LUGGit may also, anonymously, transmit the personal data of
  its Users to:
Payment and billing processors and facilitators;
Security verification service providers;
Cloud Storage providers;
Google and/or AWS servers;
Data analysis providers;
Encrypted communication service providers, to be used during the provision
    of services;
Partners that help LUGGit improve the security of our website.
8. Confidentiality
The confidentiality of all information that the User transmits is guaranteed.
LUGGit undertakes to protect the information disclosed with great care and, to
  that end, has adopted the necessary measures to prevent the use and
  dissemination of the data by any person other than itself, unless it consents
  in writing to such disclosure, which will be done on the agreed terms.
About the data provided by the Users, who intend to collaborate as Keepers or
  Partners, know that the fulfilment of the minimum requirements is assessed by
  a LUGGit team whose elements are recognised as having high technical and
  professional competence for the purpose and who are attached to
  confidentiality obligations in compliance with the rules imposed in the scope
  of the protection of personal data.
The information disclosed on the website is the sole and exclusive property of
  the disclosing entity or the property of those who have authorised such
  disclosure. LUGGit does not have any right over any type of information that
  may be transmitted to it to which it had access.
9. Security of Personal Data
LUGGit uses several technical and organisational measures to protect the
  personal data of data subjects, depending on what is appropriate for the
  specific case:
Pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
Ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and permanent
    resilience of treatment systems and services;
Ability to restore availability and access to personal data promptly in the
    event of a physical or technical incident;
Implementation of a process to test, assess and regularly evaluate the
    effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure treatment
    safety, among other actions considered appropriate and relevant on a
    case-by-case basis.
In the case of subcontracting service providers, they will have to guarantee
  the same level of protection.
The violation, or attempted breach, of the personal data for which LUGGit is
  responsible will be reported to the judicial authorities, as well as to
  control and supervision. If the breach involves a high risk for the holders of
  personal data, they will be informed of the incident.
10. Cookies Policy
LUGGit uses cookies and other identification technologies on the website for
  the following purposes:
Authenticate Users;
Remember Users' preferences and settings;
Discover the popularity of a content;
Disseminate and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns;
Analyse trends and traffic to understand online behaviours and the interests
    of people who interact with services. It may also allow other entities to
    provide measurement and analysis services to LUGGit, showing advertisements
    on the Internet on behalf of the brand and monitoring the performance of
    those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and
    other technologies to identify their device when they visit the website and
    use the LUGGit services and when they visit different websites and online
    services.
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are usually used as unique
  anonymous identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the user visits and
  stored in your device's internal memory.
This service does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, the page may use
  third party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and
  improve its services. The User can accept or refuse these cookies and know
  when a cookie is being sent to his device. If you choose to decline LUGGit
  cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of the proposed service. This
  Cookie Policy is periodically reviewed, so its content may be updated.

  and portability at all times by requesting any of the following means:
