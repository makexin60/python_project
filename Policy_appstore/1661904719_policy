3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We process your data based on legitimate interests, legal obligations, your consent, and the protection of vital interests. Specific legal bases depend on your location and the applicable laws.
In brief, we process your personal information only when we have a valid legal justification, as required by applicable laws. This section is particularly relevant if you are in the EU, UK, or Canada.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, we are obliged to outline the legitimate legal bases upon which we rely to process your personal information. To this end, we may use the following legal bases for processing your personal information:

In instances where we believe processing your information is reasonably essential to serve our legitimate business interests, provided your interests and fundamental rights aren't overridden, we may process your information. For instance, we might analyze how users interact with our Services to enhance engagement and user retention.
Legal Obligations:
When we deem it necessary to comply with our legal responsibilities, such as cooperating with law enforcement or regulatory bodies, defending our legal rights, or presenting your information as evidence in legal proceedings, we may process your information.
Vital Interests:
In situations involving potential threats to the safety of individuals, including yourself or third parties, we may process your information if we believe it's necessary to safeguard vital interests.
For individuals in Canada:
If you are located in Canada, this section pertains to you. We may process your information if you've explicitly granted us permission (express consent) for a specific purpose. You retain the right to withdraw your consent whenever you wish.
Under exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with applicable law, we may be authorized to process your information without your explicit consent. Such scenarios include:
When collection is clearly in the best interests of an individual, and obtaining consent is impractical.
For the purposes of investigations, fraud detection and prevention.
In the context of business transactions, provided specific conditions are met.
If the information is part of a witness statement, essential for assessing, processing, or settling an insurance claim.
For the purpose of identifying and communicating with next of kin in cases of injury, illness, or death.
When reasonable grounds suggest an individual is, has been, or might be a victim of financial abuse.
When obtaining consent would compromise the availability or accuracy of information, and collection is reasonable for investigating breaches or contraventions of laws.
If disclosure is mandated by a subpoena, warrant, court order, or court rules related to record production.
When the information is produced in the course of employment, business, or profession, and collection aligns with the intended purposes.
When collection is strictly for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.

When there is no ongoing legitimate business necessity to process your personal information, we will either erase or anonymize it. If deletion isn't immediately feasible (for instance, due to data stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from further processing until it can be deleted.
6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
In summary, we do not knowingly collect data from individuals under 18. If such data is unintentionally collected, we take measures to delete it promptly.

8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
We do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track signals or similar mechanisms.
Many web browsers and certain mobile operating systems and applications offer a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting. This feature allows you to express your privacy preference by signaling that you do not wish your online browsing activities to be tracked and gathered. It's important to note that there isn't currently a universally accepted technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals. Consequently, we do not presently react to DNT browser signals or any other automated method that conveys your choice to avoid online tracking. Should a standardized approach to online tracking emerge that we are obliged to adhere to in the future, we will apprise you of this practice through a revised version of this privacy notice.
