Privacy Policy
Hi!  I’m the developer of Cross Court Tennis 2 & 3, and American Football Champs.
Your privacy is very important to me.  Court Court Tennis 2 and American Football Champs have integrated Unity Video Ads that promote other apps.  These require location permission to serve relevant ads.  The location data is used for no other purpose.
In Cross Court Tennis 3 there are no ads, but a couple permissions are necessary for the In App Purchase transaction.  Your data is not used or stored or transferred to any third parties.  Information is kept private between your device and Google or Apple servers.
Thank you,
Jeremy
Owner
