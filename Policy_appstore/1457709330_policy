DATA POLICY
USING OUR MOBILE APP:
§ 1 General
(1) We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and treat it confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection notice. This data protection notice applies to our mobile app HEAT MVMNT, which you can install on your mobile device. It explains the type, purpose and scope of the collection and use of personal data when using the app. Personal data is all data that can be related to you personally, e.g. name, address, email addresses, user behaviour. We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet may be subject to security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
(2) The controller pursuant to Art. 4 (7) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is
ALH Unity GmbH
Lindenstraße 9-11
67433 Neustadt
Germany
Phone: +49 6321 9540707
E-mail: info@heat-mvmnt.de
(3) Unless otherwise stated or specified within this privacy policy, the personal data collected by this app will be stored until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies. If there is a legal obligation to store the data or another legally recognised reason for storing the data (e.g. legitimate interest), the personal data in question will not be deleted before the respective reason for storing the data no longer applies.
(4) The processing of personal data is only permitted if there is an effective legal basis for the processing of this data. If we process your data, this is regularly done on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1a) GDPR (e.g. when using the push function), for the purpose of contract fulfilment in accordance with Art. 6 (1b) GDPR (e.g. when using in-app purchases or other paid app functions), to fulfil a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6 (1c) GDPR (e.g. storage of invoice documents) or on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR, which are always weighed against your interests (e.g. when determining commission in connection with affiliate links). The relevant legal bases will be specified separately in this data protection notice.
(5) For reasons of security and to protect the transmission of confidential content, this app uses encryption for all external communication (e.g. search queries). This encryption prevents the data you transmit from being read by unauthorised third parties.
(6) When you contact us by e-mail, we will store your e-mail address and, if provided by you, your name and telephone number in order to answer your questions. We delete the data arising in this context after storage is no longer necessary, or restrict processing if there are statutory retention obligations.
(7) If we use contracted service providers for individual functions of our offer or would like to use your data for advertising purposes, we will inform you in detail below about the respective processes. In doing so, we will also state the specified criteria for the storage period. These service providers have been carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and are regularly monitored. If our service providers or partners are based in a country outside the European Union (EU), we will inform you of the consequences of this circumstance in the description of the offer. Data transfers from the UK to the EU are generally permitted on the basis of an adequacy decision made by the UK government.
(8) We reserve the right to amend this data protection notice at any time in compliance with legal requirements.
§ 2 Your rights
(1) In the following, we will inform you about your rights as a data subject in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR. You can exercise these rights at any time by contacting us directly. If you assert these rights against us, we will examine them in detail, taking into account the associated legal requirements and conditions. We may request further information from you for this purpose. We will explain the results of our review and our approach to fulfilling your request in detail. It is possible that we will not be able to fully fulfil your wishes in the manner you have requested. This should not prevent you from asserting your rights against us or asking us about them. We will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
(2) Right of access
You have the right to request information from us at any time as to whether and which of your personal data is being processed by us. This also includes information on the purposes of the processing, any recipients to whom we have disclosed your data, the planned storage period and, if applicable, information on the origin of this data if we have not collected it directly from you. In addition, you have the right to a one-off copy of your personal data stored by us free of charge. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for the creation of the following copies.
(3) Right to rectification
You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate personal data that we have stored about you. This also includes the right to have incomplete personal data completed.
(4) Right to erasure
You have the right to request that we erase data that we have stored about you. If we have published data about you, this also includes our obligation to forward all links to this data and copies or replications of this data to other controllers responsible for processing this published personal data
within the scope of the "right to be forgotten" in accordance with Art. 17 (2) GDPR, taking into account available technology and implementation costs.
(5) Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of data that we have stored about you. This data can then only be processed with your consent or for a few legally defined purposes.
(6) Right to object to the processing
Insofar as we base the processing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you can object to the processing. This is the case if, in particular, the processing is not necessary for the fulfilment of a contract with you, which is described by us in the following description of the functions. When exercising such an objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data as we have done. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the situation and will either discontinue or adapt the data processing or show you our compelling reasons worthy of protection on the basis of which we will continue the processing.
Of course, you can object to the processing of your personal data for advertising and data analysis purposes at any time. You can inform us of your objection to advertising via the contact channels listed under § 1 (2).
(7) Right to withdraw consent under data protection law
If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw this at any time. Such a revocation affects the permissibility of the processing of your personal data after you have given it to us.
(8) Right to data portability
You have the right to receive from us personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format for the purpose of transfer to another controller. At your request and taking into account the available technical possibilities, this also includes the direct transfer from us to the other controller.
(9) Right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner about our processing of your personal data at any time.
§ 3 Collection of personal data when using our mobile app
(1) When you download the mobile app, the required information is transmitted to the App Store, in particular your user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it. We only process the data to the extent necessary to download the mobile app to your mobile device.
(2) When using the mobile app, we collect the personal data described below to enable convenient use of the functions and to ensure the stability and security of our app. The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1f) GDPR:
·       Usage data
·       IP address
·       Device identification (IMEI number)
·       Your subscriber number (IMSI)
·       Your mobile phone number (MSISDN)
·       The MAC address (for WLAN use)
·       The name of your mobile device
We only store this data for as long as it is required for the fulfilment of the respective function or for other technical reasons. If we store individual data for longer, this is done anonymised or in the manner described below.
(3) Certain access authorisations are required for the functions of the app. Some of these access authorisations may involve the processing of personal data. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1a) GDPR:
·      Access to the calendar function: This access allows you to read, add and change calendar appointments and details as well as send e-mails to appointment participants.
If personal data is stored as part of this access, we only store this data for as long as it is required to fulfil the respective function or for other technical reasons. For device access, we require your consent, which you give by activating the respective access. These consents are voluntary and can be revoked by you at any time by deactivating the respective access in the settings of your device.
Special forms of utilisation
1. Evaluation function
(1) You can submit ratings for the products displayed in our app by clicking on the "Cop / Drop" buttons. The ratings are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1a) GDPR). The assignment of the rating is assigned to your end device so that you can change it later if necessary. It is not possible for other users to assign the rating.
2. Push function
(1) You can activate the receipt of so-called push notifications for the app. For this purpose, we use the "CleverPush" service, which is operated by CleverPush GmbH, Brauhausstraße 15A, 22041 Hamburg, Germany. You will receive information about releases, special promotions and other news from the sneaker world via our push notifications.
(2) To register for the push notifications, you must confirm the request from your end device to receive the notifications. This process is documented and saved by CleverPush. The time of registration and a push token or device ID are saved for this purpose. This data is used on the one hand to send you the push notifications and on the other hand as proof of your registration. The legal basis for this processing is your consent and thus Art. 6 (1a) GDPR.
(3) CleverPush also analyses our push notifications statistically. CleverPush can thus recognise whether and when our push notifications have been displayed and clicked on. This enables us to determine which push notifications are of interest to recipients in order to tailor future messages to the presumed interests of all recipients and thus increase interest in our offer. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 (1f) GDPR. A push token or device ID is only assigned to a specific person if we are legally obliged to do so, for the defence of claims against us, if this is required as evidence, and for the possible prosecution of violations of the law.
(4) You can revoke your consent to the storage and use of your personal data to receive our push notifications at any time with effect for the future. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Furthermore, you can object to the use of personal data described above on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f at any time. Please withdraw your consent for this purpose. You can revoke your consent in the setting provided for this purpose for receiving push notifications in the settings of your end device.
(5) Your data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. Your data will therefore be stored for as long as the subscription to our push notifications is active.
(6) To speed up the retrieval of content (e.g. images) and to defend against attacks, CleverPush uses the services of cloudflare.com, an offer from Cloudflare, Inc. 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA, as part of order processing on the basis of the standard contractual clauses. CleverPush does not store any data on Cloudflare's servers that contains personal data, but only general content such as text or images. When you access this content, the end device you are using establishes a connection to Cloudflare and the IP address of the end device you are using is processed as a result.
3. Calendar function
(1) You can use the calendar function to enter release dates in the calendar you use on your end device. We use the calendar access exclusively for this purpose and do not access any other information entered in your calendar.
(2) To use the calendar function, you must actively grant the app access to the calendar (see § 3). This is done by positively answering the corresponding question of the operating system used by your end device or by subsequent activation in the app settings of your end device. The legal basis for this data processing is therefore your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1a) GDPR. You can revoke your consent for the future at any time by deactivating the access authorisation in the app settings.
4. Search function
(1) We use the services of everysize GmbH, Schellengasse 2, 74072 Heilbronn, Germany for our search function. For this purpose, we transmit your search query to everysize. With this data, everysize in turn carries out a search in all connected online shops and returns the search result to our app. This data processing is absolutely necessary to provide the service you have requested.
(2) If you switch to the linked shop via a search result, we and everysize receive a commission ("affiliate link") from the shop operator. Information is stored by us or everysize for verification and analysis purposes (manufacturer, sneaker model, price, shoe size, partner shop, source of the link to the shop (app/link), target page, identification ID, pseudonymised IP address). Both our business model and that of everysize are based on this. Without this monetisation, we and everysize would not be able to offer you our services free of charge. The legal basis for the associated data processing is the legitimate interest of us and everysize in accordance with Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
Data analysis and advertising
When you access our app, your behaviour may be statistically evaluated with the help of certain analysis tools and analysed for advertising and market research purposes or to improve our offers. When using such tools, we ensure compliance with the statutory data protection regulations. When using external service providers (processors), we ensure through appropriate contracts with the service providers that the data processing complies with UK data protection standards.
1. Google analytics for firebase
(1) We use Google Analytics for Firebase (hereinafter referred to as Firebase Analytics) to analyse user behaviour. The provider is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Firebase Analytics includes various functions that enable us to analyse your in-app behaviour. In this way, we can, for example, analyse your screen views, button clicks, in-app purchases or the effectiveness of advertising measures. We can also determine which functions within our app are used frequently or rarely. For these purposes, Firebase Analytics stores, among other things, the number and duration of sessions, operating systems, device models, region and a range of other data. The use of Firebase Analytics may require the transfer of your personal data to the USA. You can find a detailed overview of the data collected by Firebase Analytics at https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039?hl=de.
(2) Firebase Analytics is used to optimise this app and to improve our services. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1f) GDPR. Further information on the Firebase platform and data protection can be found at

2 Google Firebase Crashlytics
(1) We use Google Firebase Crashlytics (hereinafter Crashlytics) to analyse and process errors that occur in our app. The provider is Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Crashlytics is a real-time crash reporter that allows us to track, prioritise and resolve app stability issues. In the event of a crash of the app, Crashlytics creates a mini-dump of device information relevant for error analysis. The use of Crashlytics may require the transfer of your personal data to the USA. Examples of the data collected and transferred by Crashlytics can be viewed at

. Further information about Crashlytics can be found at
https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics?hl=de
.
(2) Crashlytics is used exclusively to improve the stability of our app. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1f) GDPR. The data collected in the process is only stored for the duration of the error processing and then deleted in accordance with data protection regulations. Further information on the Firebase platform and data protection can be found at
https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html

3. Adjust
(1) Our app uses the Adjust framework to evaluate and improve the efficiency of our campaigns. Adjust allows us to track from where and via which link you have downloaded our app. This allows us to better understand which marketing and advertising campaigns we use to reach new interested parties for our app. Adjust also analyses your use of our app, i.e. which functions you use how often and which buttons you click. We use this information to better understand and further improve the use of the app by our users. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
(2) The data collected is always analysed anonymously by linking it to the advertising ID of your end device. You have the option of deactivating tracking via Adjust on the following website:
https://www.adjust.com/forget-device/
.
(3) Adjust is a product of Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Straße 37A, 10405 Berlin, Germany. We have concluded a contract with this service provider to protect your data to the extent required by data protection law. Further information on data protection and data security in connection with the use of the Adjust Framework can be found at
https://www.adjust.com/security/
.
4. Advertising or AD-ID
(1) For advertising purposes, we use an advertising ID (Android) or AD-ID (iOS). This is a unique, but non-personalised and non-permanent identification number for a specific end device, which is provided by the respective operating system. We use this ID to provide you with personalised advertising and to evaluate your usage. We do not link this ID with personal data of your end device.
(2) You can deactivate personalised advertising and tracking in the respective device settings of your operating system. We can then only carry out the following measures: Measurement of your interaction with banners by counting the number of times a banner is displayed without being clicked on ("frequency capping"), click rate, detection of unique usage ("unique user") as well as security measures, fraud prevention and troubleshooting. You can also reset the advertising or AD ID at any time in the device settings. A new ID will then be created that will not be merged with the previously collected data. We would like to point out that you may not be able to use all the functions of our app if you restrict the use of the advertising or AD ID.
Other third-party services
1. Integration of DatoCMS
(1) This app displays content that is managed in DatoCMS, a so-called headless content management system. This content is located on servers of the provider of DatoCMS, which is why these servers are accessed with the associated data transfers.
(2) The use of DatoCMS is necessary for technical reasons in order to be able to display the content you have requested. The legal basis for the use is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
(3) The provider of DatoCMS is Dato S.r.l., Via Francesco Botticini 3, 50143 Florence, Italy. Information on Dato S.r.l.'s data protection can be found at
https://www.datocms.com/legal/privacy-policy

2. Integration of the web analysis service Sentry
(1) We use the web analysis service Sentry from the provider Functional Software, Inc, 45 Fremont Street, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, to identify errors and problems that occur when using our app and subsequently to increase the stability of our app. Sentry exclusively serves these purposes and does not process any data for other purposes. The legal basis for data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR. The data collected, such as information on the end device, the function called up or the time of the error, is effectively anonymised immediately after collection (IP anonymisation) and thus not processed further in a personalised manner. If the data is no longer required for further error analysis, it is deleted immediately. Further information on this can be found in Functional Software's privacy policy:
https://sentry.io/privacy/
.
(2) Functional Software is a member of the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and has submitted to the associated data protection requirements regarding the processing of personal data of UK citizens in the USA. According to the adequacy decision of the UK government, an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of Art. 45 para. 2 GDPR is thus guaranteed and data transfer to the USA is permitted.

You can revoke your consent for the future at any time by deactivating the access authorisation in the app settings.
4. Search function
(1) We use the services of everysize GmbH, Schellengasse 2, 74072 Heilbronn, Germany for our search function. For this purpose, we transmit your search query to everysize. With this data, everysize in turn carries out a search in all connected online shops and returns the search result to our app. This data processing is absolutely necessary to provide the service you have requested.
(2) If you switch to the linked shop via a search result, we and everysize receive a commission ("affiliate link") from the shop operator. Information is stored by us or everysize for verification and analysis purposes (manufacturer, sneaker model, price, shoe size, partner shop, source of the link to the shop (app/link), target page, identification ID, pseudonymised IP address). Both our business model and that of everysize are based on this. Without this monetisation, we and everysize would not be able to offer you our services free of charge. The legal basis for the associated data processing is the legitimate interest of us and everysize in accordance with Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
Data analysis and advertising
When you access our app, your behaviour may be statistically evaluated with the help of certain analysis tools and analysed for advertising and market research purposes or to improve our offers. When using such tools, we ensure compliance with the statutory data protection regulations. When using external service providers (processors), we ensure through appropriate contracts with the service providers that the data processing complies with UK data protection standards.
1. Google analytics for firebase

3. Adjust
(1) Our app uses the Adjust framework to evaluate and improve the efficiency of our campaigns. Adjust allows us to track from where and via which link you have downloaded our app. This allows us to better understand which marketing and advertising campaigns we use to reach new interested parties for our app. Adjust also analyses your use of our app, i.e. which functions you use how often and which buttons you click. We use this information to better understand and further improve the use of the app by our users. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
(2) The data collected is always analysed anonymously by linking it to the advertising ID of your end device. You have the option of deactivating tracking via Adjust on the following website:
https://www.adjust.com/forget-device/
.
(3) Adjust is a product of Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Straße 37A, 10405 Berlin, Germany. We have concluded a contract with this service provider to protect your data to the extent required by data protection law. Further information on data protection and data security in connection with the use of the Adjust Framework can be found at
https://www.adjust.com/security/
.
4. Advertising or AD-ID
(1) For advertising purposes, we use an advertising ID (Android) or AD-ID (iOS). This is a unique, but non-personalised and non-permanent identification number for a specific end device, which is provided by the respective operating system. We use this ID to provide you with personalised advertising and to evaluate your usage. We do not link this ID with personal data of your end device.
(2) You can deactivate personalised advertising and tracking in the respective device settings of your operating system. We can then only carry out the following measures: Measurement of your interaction with banners by counting the number of times a banner is displayed without being clicked on ("frequency capping"), click rate, detection of unique usage ("unique user") as well as security measures, fraud prevention and troubleshooting. You can also reset the advertising or AD ID at any time in the device settings. A new ID will then be created that will not be merged with the previously collected data. We would like to point out that you may not be able to use all the functions of our app if you restrict the use of the advertising or AD ID.
Other third-party services
1. Integration of DatoCMS
(1) This app displays content that is managed in DatoCMS, a so-called headless content management system. This content is located on servers of the provider of DatoCMS, which is why these servers are accessed with the associated data transfers.
(2) The use of DatoCMS is necessary for technical reasons in order to be able to display the content you have requested. The legal basis for the use is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1f) GDPR.
(3) The provider of DatoCMS is Dato S.r.l., Via Francesco Botticini 3, 50143 Florence, Italy. Information on Dato S.r.l.'s data protection can be found at

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC

,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.
See more details at
Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud
.

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).

Auf dieser Seite werden die wichtigsten Sicherheits- und Datenschutzinformationen von Firebase aufgeführt. Ganz gleich, ob Sie ein neues Projekt mit Firebase starten möchten oder neugierig sind, wie Firebase mit Ihrem bestehenden Projekt funktioniert: Lesen Sie weiter, um zu erfahren, wie Firebase Sie und Ihre Benutzer schützen kann.
Letzte Änderung: 25. Juli 2023
Datenschutz
Firebase-Unterstützung für DSGVO und CCPA
Am 25. Mai 2018 ersetzte die EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) die EU-Datenschutzrichtlinie von 1995. Am 1. Januar 2020 trat der California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in Kraft. Am 1. Januar 2023 trat der California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in Kraft, ein Datenschutzgesetz, das den CCPA ändert und erweitert. Google ist bestrebt, seinen Kunden dabei zu helfen, diese Datenschutzbestimmungen erfolgreich einzuhalten, unabhängig davon, ob es sich um große Softwareunternehmen oder unabhängige Entwickler handelt.
Die DSGVO erlegt Datenverantwortlichen und Datenverarbeitern Verpflichtungen auf, und die CCPA/CPRA erlegt Unternehmen und ihren Dienstleistern Verpflichtungen auf. Firebase-Kunden fungieren in der Regel als „Datenverantwortlicher“ (DSGVO) oder „Unternehmen“ (CCPA/CPRA) für alle personenbezogenen Daten oder Informationen über ihre Endnutzer, die sie Google im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung von Firebase zur Verfügung stellen, und Google fungiert im Allgemeinen als dieser ein „Datenverarbeiter“ (DSGVO) oder „Dienstleister“ (CCPA/CPRA).
Das bedeutet, dass die Daten unter der Kontrolle des Kunden stehen. Kunden sind für Verpflichtungen wie die Erfüllung der Rechte einer Person in Bezug auf ihre persönlichen Daten oder Informationen verantwortlich.
Firebase-Datenverarbeitungs- und Sicherheitsbedingungen
Wenn Kunden Firebase nutzen, ist Google in der Regel Datenverarbeiter im Sinne der DSGVO und verarbeitet personenbezogene Daten in ihrem Namen. Wenn Kunden Firebase nutzen, agiert Google im Allgemeinen als Dienstleister im Rahmen des CCPA/CPRA und verarbeitet personenbezogene Daten in ihrem Namen. Die Firebase-Bedingungen umfassen
Datenverarbeitungs- und Sicherheitsbedingungen,
in denen diese Verantwortlichkeiten detailliert beschrieben werden.
Bestimmte Firebase-Dienste
, die den Nutzungsbedingungen der Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
unterliegen, unterliegen bereits den zugehörigen Datenverarbeitungsbedingungen, dem
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
. Eine vollständige Liste der Firebase-Dienste, die derzeit den GCP-Nutzungsbedingungen unterliegen, finden Sie in den
Nutzungsbedingungen für Firebase-Dienste
.
Google Analytics ist ein separater Dienst, der zusammen mit Firebase verwendet werden kann und separaten
Bedingungen
unterliegt.
Firebase ist nach wichtigen Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsstandards zertifiziert
ISO- und SOC-Konformität
Alle Firebase-Dienste (außer App Indexing) haben den
ISO 27001-
und
SOC 1-
,
SOC 2-
und
SOC 3
-Bewertungsprozess erfolgreich abgeschlossen, und einige haben auch den
ISO 27017-
und
ISO 27018-
Zertifizierungsprozess abgeschlossen. Compliance-Berichte und Zertifikate für Firebase-Dienste, die den GCP-Nutzungsbedingungen unterliegen, können über den
Compliance Reports Manager

Internationale Datenübertragungen
Die Privacy Shield-Rahmenwerke stellten einen Mechanismus zur Einhaltung der Datenschutzanforderungen bei der Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten aus dem EWR, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder der Schweiz in die Vereinigten Staaten und darüber hinaus bereit. Angesichts des Urteils des Gerichtshofs der Europäischen Union zu Datenübermittlungen, mit dem das EU-US-Datenschutzschild für ungültig erklärt wurde, ist Firebase dazu übergegangen, sich für relevante Datenübermittlungen auf Standardvertragsklauseln zu stützen, die laut Urteil weiterhin gelten können gültiger rechtlicher Mechanismus zur Datenübermittlung gemäß der DSGVO. Die Europäische Kommission hat am 4. Juni 2021 neue Versionen der Standardvertragsklauseln genehmigt, die wir in unsere Verträge mit Firebase-Kunden für relevante Datenübertragungen integrieren.
Wir verpflichten uns zu einer rechtmäßigen Grundlage für Datenübertragungen unter Einhaltung der geltenden Datenschutzgesetze.
Informationen zur Datenverarbeitung
Beispiele für von Firebase verarbeitete Endnutzerdaten
Einige Firebase-Dienste verarbeiten die Daten Ihrer Endbenutzer, um ihren Dienst bereitzustellen. Die folgende Tabelle enthält Beispiele dafür, wie verschiedene Firebase-Dienste potenziell identifizierende Endbenutzerdaten verwenden und verarbeiten. Darüber hinaus bieten viele Firebase-Dienste die Möglichkeit, die Löschung bestimmter Daten anzufordern oder den Umgang mit Daten zu steuern.
Firebase-Dienst
Endbenutzerdaten
Wie Daten zur Bereitstellung des Dienstes beitragen
Cloud-Funktionen für Firebase
IP-Adressen
So hilft es:
Cloud Functions verwendet IP-Adressen, um Ereignisverarbeitungsfunktionen und HTTP-Funktionen basierend auf Endbenutzeraktionen auszuführen.
Aufbewahrung:
Cloud-Funktionen speichern IP-Adressen nur vorübergehend, um den Dienst bereitzustellen.
Dynamische Firebase-Links
Gerätespezifikationen (iOS)
IP-Adressen (iOS)
So hilft es:
Dynamic Links verwendet Gerätespezifikationen und IP-Adressen unter iOS, um neu installierte Apps für eine bestimmte Seite oder einen bestimmten Kontext zu öffnen.
Aufbewahrung:
Dynamic Links speichert Gerätespezifikationen und IP-Adressen nur vorübergehend, um den Dienst bereitzustellen.
Firebase Cloud-Messaging
Firebase-Installations-IDs
So hilft es:
Firebase Cloud Messaging verwendet Firebase-Installations-IDs, um zu bestimmen, an welche Geräte Nachrichten gesendet werden sollen.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase behält die Firebase-Installations-IDs bei, bis der Firebase-Kunde einen API-Aufruf zum Löschen der ID durchführt. Nach dem Anruf werden die Daten innerhalb von 180 Tagen aus Live- und Backup-Systemen entfernt.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics-Installations-UUIDs
Firebase-Installations-ID
Absturzspuren
Breakpad-Minidump-formatierte Daten
(Nur NDK stürzt ab)
Wie es hilft:
Firebase Crashlytics verwendet Absturz-Stack-Traces, um Abstürze einem Projekt zuzuordnen, E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen an Projektmitglieder zu senden und diese in der Firebase-Konsole anzuzeigen und Firebase-Kunden beim Debuggen von Abstürzen zu helfen. Es verwendet Crashlytics-Installations-UUIDs, um die Anzahl der von einem Absturz betroffenen Benutzer zu messen, und Minidump-Daten, um NDK-Abstürze zu verarbeiten. Die Minidump-Daten werden während der Verarbeitung der Absturzsitzung gespeichert und anschließend verworfen. Die Firebase-Installations-ID ermöglicht kommende Funktionen, die die Absturzberichte und Absturzverwaltungsdienste verbessern. Weitere Einzelheiten zu den Arten der gesammelten
Benutzerinformationen finden Sie unter Beispiele für gespeicherte Geräteinformationen
.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase Crashlytics speichert Crash-Stack-Traces, extrahierte Minidump-Daten und zugehörige Kennungen (einschließlich Crashlytics-Installations-UUIDs und Firebase-Installations-IDs) 90 Tage lang, bevor mit dem Prozess der Entfernung aus Live- und Backup-Systemen begonnen wird.
Hinweis:
Firebase Crashlytics speichert Minidump-Daten nur vorübergehend, um NDK-Abstürze zu verarbeiten.
Firebase In-App-Messaging
Firebase-Installations-IDs
So hilft es:
Firebase In-App Messaging verwendet Firebase-Installations-IDs, um zu bestimmen, an welche Geräte Nachrichten gesendet werden sollen.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase behält die Firebase-Installations-IDs bei, bis der Firebase-Kunde einen API-Aufruf zum Löschen der ID durchführt. Nach dem Anruf werden die Daten innerhalb von 180 Tagen aus Live- und Backup-Systemen entfernt.
Firebase ML
Hochgeladene Bilder
Installations-Authentifizierungstoken
So hilft es:
Die Cloud-basierten APIs speichern hochgeladene Bilder vorübergehend, um sie zu verarbeiten und die Analyse an Sie zurückzusenden. Gespeicherte Bilder werden normalerweise innerhalb weniger Stunden gelöscht. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in den
FAQ zur Cloud Vision-Datennutzung
.
Installationsauthentifizierungstoken
werden von Firebase ML zur Geräteauthentifizierung bei der Interaktion mit App-Instanzen verwendet, beispielsweise um Entwicklermodelle an App-Instanzen zu verteilen.
Aufbewahrung:
Installationsauthentifizierungstoken bleiben bis zu ihrem Ablaufdatum gültig. Die Standard-Token-Lebensdauer beträgt eine Woche.
Firebase-App-Check
Bescheinigungsmaterial von unterstützten Bescheinigungsanbietern
App-Check-Tokens aus erfolgreichen Attestierungen
So hilft es:
Firebase App Check verwendet Attestierungsmaterial, das vom entsprechenden Attestierungsanbieter benötigt und von den Geräten des Endbenutzers empfangen wird, um die Integrität des Geräts und/oder der App festzustellen. Bescheinigungsmaterialien werden zur Validierung basierend auf der Konfiguration des Entwicklers an den entsprechenden Bescheinigungsanbieter gesendet. Aus erfolgreichen Attestierungen erhaltene App Check-Tokens werden mit jeder Anfrage an unterstützte Firebase-Dienste gesendet, um auf durch App Check geschützte Ressourcen zuzugreifen.
Aufbewahrung:
Bescheinigungsmaterial wird von App Check nicht aufbewahrt, aber wenn es an Bescheinigungsanbieter gesendet wird, unterliegt es den Bedingungen dieser Bescheinigungsanbieter. Von erfolgreichen Attestierungen zurückgegebene App-Check-Tokens sind während ihrer gesamten TTL-Dauer gültig, die nicht länger als 7 Tage sein darf. Für Entwickler, die Wiedergabeschutzfunktionen verwenden, speichert App Check die mit diesen Funktionen verwendeten App Check-Tokens höchstens 30 Tage lang. Andere App-Check-Tokens, die nicht mit Wiedergabeschutzfunktionen verwendet werden, werden von Firebase-Diensten nicht aufbewahrt.
Firebase-App-Verteilung
Namen der Benutzer
E-mailadressen
iOS-UDIDs
Sichere Android-IDs
Firebase-Installations-IDs
Tester-Feedback (Screenshots und Text)
So hilft es:
Firebase App Distribution verwendet die Daten, um App-Builds an Tester zu verteilen, Testeraktivitäten zu überwachen, Testerfunktionen wie In-App-Feedback zu aktivieren und Daten mit Testergeräten zu verknüpfen.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase App Distribution speichert Benutzerinformationen, bis der Firebase-Kunde deren Löschung anfordert. Anschließend werden die Daten innerhalb von 180 Tagen aus Live- und Backup-Systemen entfernt.
Firebase-Authentifizierung
Passwörter
E-mailadressen
Telefonnummern
Benutzeragenten
IP-Adressen
So hilft es:
Firebase Authentication nutzt die Daten, um die Authentifizierung von Endbenutzern zu ermöglichen und die Verwaltung von Endbenutzerkonten zu erleichtern. Außerdem werden User-Agent-Strings und IP-Adressen verwendet, um zusätzliche Sicherheit zu bieten und Missbrauch bei der Anmeldung und Authentifizierung zu verhindern.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase Authentication speichert protokollierte IP-Adressen einige Wochen lang. Es behält andere Authentifizierungsinformationen bei, bis der Firebase-Kunde die Löschung des zugehörigen Benutzers veranlasst. Anschließend werden die Daten innerhalb von 180 Tagen aus Live- und Backup-Systemen entfernt.
Firebase-Echtzeitdatenbank
IP-Adressen
Benutzeragenten
So hilft es:
Realtime Database nutzt IP-Adressen und Benutzeragenten, um das
Profiler-Tool
zu aktivieren, das Firebase-Kunden hilft, Nutzungstrends und Plattformausfälle zu verstehen.
Aufbewahrung:
Realtime Database speichert IP-Adressen und User-Agent-Informationen einige Tage lang, es sei denn, ein Kunde entscheidet sich für eine längere Speicherung.
Firebase-Hosting
IP-Adressen
So hilft es:
Hosting nutzt IP-Adressen eingehender Anfragen, um Missbrauch zu erkennen und Kunden eine detaillierte Analyse der Nutzungsdaten zu ermöglichen.
Aufbewahrung:
Das Hosting speichert IP-Daten einige Monate lang.
Firebase-Leistungsüberwachung
Firebase-Installations-IDs
IP-Adressen
So hilft es:
Performance Monitoring verwendet Firebase-Installations-IDs, um die Anzahl eindeutiger Firebase-Installationen zu berechnen, die auf Netzwerkressourcen zugreifen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Zugriffsmuster ausreichend anonym sind. Außerdem werden Firebase-Installations-IDs mit Firebase Remote Config verwendet, um die Rate der Leistungsereignisberichte zu verwalten. Darüber hinaus werden IP-Adressen verwendet, um Leistungsereignisse den Ländern zuzuordnen, aus denen sie stammen. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter
Datenerfassung
.
Aufbewahrung:
Performance Monitoring speichert IP-bezogene Ereignisse 30 Tage lang und mit der Installation verbundene und nicht identifizierte Leistungsdaten 90 Tage lang, bevor mit dem Prozess der Entfernung dieser Daten aus Live- und Backup-Systemen begonnen wird.
Firebase-Remote-Konfiguration
Firebase-Installations-IDs
So hilft es:
Remote Config verwendet Firebase-Installations-IDs, um Konfigurationswerte auszuwählen, die an Endbenutzergeräte zurückgegeben werden sollen.
Aufbewahrung:
Firebase behält die Firebase-Installations-IDs bei, bis der Firebase-Kunde einen API-Aufruf zum Löschen der ID durchführt. Nach dem Anruf werden die Daten innerhalb von 180 Tagen aus Live- und Backup-Systemen entfernt.

Anleitungen zum Aktivieren der Opt-in-Option für die Datenverarbeitung von Endbenutzern
Die Dienste in der obigen Tabelle benötigen eine gewisse Menge an Endbenutzerdaten, um zu funktionieren. Daher ist es nicht möglich, die Datenerfassung während der Nutzung dieser Dienste vollständig zu deaktivieren.
Wenn Sie ein Kunde sind, der Benutzern die Möglichkeit bieten möchte, sich für einen Dienst und die damit verbundene Datenerfassung anzumelden, reicht es in den meisten Fällen aus, vor der Nutzung des Dienstes lediglich einen Dialog hinzuzufügen oder die Einstellungen umzuschalten.
Einige Dienste starten jedoch automatisch, wenn sie in eine App integriert werden. Um Benutzern die Möglichkeit zu geben, sich vor der Nutzung dieser Dienste anzumelden, können Sie die automatische Initialisierung für jeden Dienst deaktivieren und sie stattdessen zur Laufzeit manuell initialisieren. Um herauszufinden, wie das geht, lesen Sie die folgenden Anleitungen:
Cloud Messaging:
Automatische Initialisierung verhindern (Android)
oder
Automatische Initialisierung verhindern (iOS+)
Crashlytics:
Opt-in-Reporting aktivieren (iOS+)
oder
Opt-in-Reporting aktivieren (Android)
Leistungsüberwachung:
Aktivieren Sie die Opt-in-Überwachung
Wenn Sie Firebase mit Google Analytics integrieren, erfahren Sie, wie Sie
die Analytics-Datenerfassung konfigurieren
.
Speicher- und Verarbeitungsorte der Daten
Sofern ein Dienst oder eine Funktion keine Auswahl des Datenstandorts bietet, kann Firebase Ihre Daten überall dort verarbeiten und speichern, wo Google oder seine Vertreter Einrichtungen unterhalten. Mögliche Standorte der Einrichtungen variieren je nach Dienst.
Nur in den USA verfügbare Dienste
Der Firebase-Authentifizierungsdienst wird nur von US-Rechenzentren aus ausgeführt. Daher verarbeitet Firebase Authentication Daten ausschließlich in den Vereinigten Staaten.
Globale Dienstleistungen
Die meisten Firebase-Dienste laufen auf der globalen Google-Infrastruktur. Sie könnten Daten an jedem der
Google Cloud Platform-Standorte
oder
Google-Rechenzentrumsstandorte
verarbeiten. Für einige Dienste können Sie eine bestimmte
Datenstandortauswahl
treffen, die die Verarbeitung auf diesen Standort beschränkt.

processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
Further information about retention time
Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
Therefore:
Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of  this document or by contacting the Owner.
The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.
In particular, Users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:
Withdraw their consent at any time.

Verify and seek rectification.
Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.
Restrict the processing of their Data.

Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.
Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification.

You have the right to request that we disclose to you:
the categories of personal information that we collect about you;
the sources from which the personal information is collected;
the purposes for which we use your information;
to whom we disclose such information;
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
You also have
the right to know what personal information is sold or shared and to whom.
In particular, you have the right to request two separate lists from us where we disclose:
the categories of personal information that we sold or shared about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose and the categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a business purpose.
The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.
If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.
The right to request the deletion of your personal information
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.
The right to correct inaccurate personal information
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.
The right to opt out of sale or sharing of personal information and to limit the use of your sensitive personal information
You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You also have the right to request that we limit our use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.
The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other rights (the right to non-discrimination)
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.
To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.
How to exercise your rights
To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.
For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.
If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.
You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
How and when we are expected to handle your request
We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.
We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.
Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.

Legal basis for processing personal information
If you are based in Europe, we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable European laws. This means we collect and process your information only where:

It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in connection with a legal claim, such as to respond to judicial orders or subpoenas; or
You provide consent for a specific purpose, such as for marketing communications (where consent is required under applicable marketing laws).
The legal bases depend on the type of information and the purpose for our processing. In some contexts, more than one legal basis applies. When we process your information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on such consent before it is withdrawn. To exercise your rights, see
“Your data protection rights”
below. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g., your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Service.

How does Sentry keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet, or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. In particular, email sent to or from Sentry may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.

International data transfers
In some cases your personal information is transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our Site and Service are hosted in the United States and Germany, and our affiliate companies and third-party service providers operate around the world, including in the United States, Canada and Europe. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of Europe and Switzerland, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission and Swiss Federal Administration, and “adequacy regulations” from the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this policy. The safeguards we use are the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, and other appropriate legal mechanisms. This is how transfers of personal information between our group companies and with our third-party service providers will be safeguarded.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
Functional Software, Inc. (our registered company name) participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the

) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information about you that is transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the U.S.  We have self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles for all information about you that is received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We have also self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (together with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles, the
“Data Privacy Framework Principles”
) for all information about you that is received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles will govern.
As required under the Data Privacy Framework, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may be required to disclose information about you under the Data Privacy Framework in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view Sentry’s certification, please see the
Data Privacy Framework website

We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework-related (or general privacy-related) complaint and we commit to resolve any such complaint.

Data retention
We retain the personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).  In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our relationship has ended. For example, we may retain your data for longer than the usual retention period when we have a legal obligation to do such, to deal with and resolve requests and complaints, to protect an individual’s rights and property, and for litigation and regulatory matters. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of any legal requirement. The criteria we use to determine the retention period include:
How long is the personal information needed to provide the Service or operate our business?
This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Service, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
Is there an automated control, such as in your Sentry dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal information at any time?
If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.
Is the personal information of a sensitive type?
If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.
Has consent been provided for a longer retention period?
If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.
Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?
Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal reason to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
