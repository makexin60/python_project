Information the App Collects
The app does not collect any information. All information added to the app resides within the app itself.
Analytics
The current app version and later does not use any first or third party analytics other than the Apple App Analytics, which you may optionally opt into on your device. These are covered by Appleâ€™s (Apple Inc.) privacy policy which can be found under the privacy settings on the iOS device. The key reason these analytics are used by the app is to be able to detect app crashes and fix them.
