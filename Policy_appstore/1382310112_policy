Heges Privacy Policy
By downloading or using the Heges application you agree to this privacy policy, if you do not agree with this privacy policy, please do not download or use the Heges application.
This application uses the Camera API to capture photos using the rear RGB camera and the TrueDepth API to obtain depthmaps and RGB frames (from the front-facing TrueDepth camera) that are used to create 3D model and live preview of the camera data. The captured photos and 3D scans are stored only on your device and do not leave it until you decide to share them via the built-in Wi-Fi sharing server that you can enable or disable at will. You have full control over all of your data (photos and scans) — you can view and permanently delete them.
The application does not track you in any way, does not collect data to any servers and does not use any advertising. The application does not include/implement any analytics. This means it does not use the Internet connection to send any data, except when loading information about in-app purchases (IAPs), buying IAPs and restoring IAPs (and therefore definitely does not work with any of your personal information and cannot identify you (there is no reason to do so) — no tracking is involved). The built-in Wi-Fi sharing server does not require the Internet connection — it is fully functional on local Wi-Fi network, so make sure you trust the Wi-Fi connection provider when sharing data via the built-in Wi-Fi sharing server.
No third parties are involved. You own your data and they are shared with no third party.
