Kumeai has been very communicative and did an excellent job of shipping the reader very quickly.
The supplied documentation is thorough enough to get started developing for the RFID reader. Inclusion of sample applications and source code for developing Android and iOS applications has made it very easy to get started developing for this bluetooth RFID reader.
After a couple of weeks with the reader, I am very happy with it.
Galen Krumel from Hover Inc, USA
Works exactly as advertised. There is a little bit of a learning curve but easy enough to catch on. When you load the app and use it for the first time make sure you change the region if you are not in China. Otherwise, I am very happy with the purchase.
The unit was bought to control football equipment inventory. Limit loss and tracking.
Kumeai kept me informed throughout the process and delivery.
