Location Data.
We collect location data such as information about your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise.

For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

Cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a piece of information that is held on the hard drive of your computer which records how you have used a website. Cookies allow website operators to accumulate useful information, such as whether the computer (and sometimes its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
How we use Cookies
Like many websites, we use Cookies on our Site. For specific information about the Cookies that we use related to powering our store with Shopify, see https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies. We use Cookies to power and improve our Site and our Services (including to remember your actions and preferences), to run analytics and better understand user interaction with the Services (in our legitimate interests to administer, improve and optimize the Services). We may also permit third parties and services providers to use Cookies on our Site to better tailor the services, products and advertising on our Site and other websites.
Most browsers automatically accept Cookies by default, but you can choose to set your browser to remove or reject Cookies through your browser controls. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking Cookies can negatively impact your user experience and may cause some of the Services, including certain features and general functionality, to work incorrectly or no longer be available. Additionally, blocking Cookies may not completely prevent how we share information with third parties such as our advertising partners.
Soft Opt-In
Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations ("PECR"), we may send you marketing communications without your prior consent if you are an existing customer or have previously expressed an interest in our products or Services. This is known as the soft opt-in.
We will only use the soft opt-in if we have obtained your contact details in the course of signing up for the Barista Bar Loyalty Scheme after 1st January 2024 or purchasing merchandise through shop.mybaristabar.com, if we are marketing our own similar products or services, and if we give you the opportunity to opt-out of future marketing communications.
Sign ups to the Barista Bar loyalty scheme prior to 1st January 2024 will be processed based on the hard opt-in/opt-out provided at the point of registration.
If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, your marketing permissions can be altered in our Loyalty App, or details of how to unsubscribe from emails will be included with each email we send you. Alternatively, you can email us at
hello@mybaristabar.com
to change your contact preferences.
Please be aware that there may be times when it is necessary for us to contact you even if you have opted out of receiving other communications from us, such as for administrative or operational reasons.
