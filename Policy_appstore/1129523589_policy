Categories of cookies we use
Strictly Necessary (or ‘essential')
:
Necessary for the operation of our service. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your cookie preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of our services will not then work. They do not store any personal information.
Performance
: Enable us to measure and improve our website by collecting, analysing and reporting information on how you and others use it. These cookies and similar technologies collect information in a way that does not directly identify you or anyone else. If you disable these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our services and we won’t be able to properly monitor its performance for you.
Functional
: Help us to provide enhanced functionality and content personalisation on our services. For example, they help us to recognise you when you return to our services, to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences, such as your choice of language. They do not track your browsing activity on third party websites. If you disable these cookies, our enhanced functionality and content personalisation may not function properly.
Targeting
: Set through our services by our third-party advertising partners to improve your ad experience on other sites or apps. They are used by our partners to build a profile of your interests to show you more relevant and personalised marketing communications on other sites or apps, to measure the effectiveness of these marketing communications, and to prevent you from seeing the same ones repeatedly. These cookies and similar technologies do not store personal information that directly identifies you, but instead use a unique identifier to identify your browser or device (e.g. your IP address, MAID or IFA). If you disable these cookies, you will still see marketing communications and ads on other sites or apps, but they will not be as relevant to your interests. We will continue to personalise your experience on our services through cookies you have not disabled.
2. ADVERTISING
Our services are part-funded by the sale of advertising, or ‘ads’. You will see ads when accessing content on our services, but you can control whether and how we and our advertising technology partners use your personal information to make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Ad categories
Tailored
: These store information, or access information that is already stored, on your device, such as advertising identifiers, device identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. They enable the collection of personal information and other information (e.g. your Advertising Information) and, in combination with information independently collected by Google, enable Google and its ad technology providers to manage, deliver and measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services, to stop you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to detect and stop click fraud.
Non-tailored
: These ads are selected, displayed and measured by our ad serving partner, Google. Non-tailored ads involve Google storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookie / mobile identifiers) but otherwise do not use your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make non-tailored ads more relevant to you, we and Google use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our Services.
Generic
: These ads are pre-recorded and inserted by DAZN into the content you access and view. Unlike non-tailored ads generic ads do not involve our ad serving partner, Google, storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookies or other identifiers) or the use of your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make generic ads more relevant to you, we use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our services.
Delivering our ads
We use Google Ad Manager as our ad serving platform for tailored and non-tailored ads.  Subject to any preferences you have expressed – including consent, where required – Google will store and/or access information on your device using its Google tag, SDK or application programming interface (API) integrated with our services in order to perform the following, subject to your preferences:
To create a tailored ads profile about you;
To select tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To deliver tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To measure ad performance of tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To stop you seeing the same ad repeatedly;
To detect and combat fraud and abuse.
Where legally required, we will collect your consent for the storage and/or access to information on your device, and the collection, sharing and use of personal information to select, display and/or measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services.
How personal information is used for tailored ads
We understand the importance of transparency in relation to how we and our partner ad technology providers – including Google – use your personal information. The following is a breakdown of the personal information processing activities involved to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
Our partner ad technology providers store and access information on your device to select, display and measure tailored ads. If you opt-out of information storage and access via Settings, you will receive only generic ads.
Subject to your preferences, our ad technology providers will use a combination of the following personal information to build a profile about you and your interests, and to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
We collect Advertising Information about your use of our services, which we then aggregate (or otherwise combine) with Advertising Information of other similar users and subsequently share. We do not provide any direct personal identifiers, or any attributes or behavioural characteristics of the audience segments assigned to you with our partner ad technology providers for the purpose of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.
Our ad technology providers independently collect personal information on the sites you visit, your search history, the apps you use, and other information, which they may combine with the information shared by us in order to work with their own partner ad technology providers to select, display and measure tailored ads on our services. Please note that we do not control and take no responsibility for the personal information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect on third party sites and apps for the purposes of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.
You are always free at any time to opt-out of tailored ads as detailed in
Customising your preferences
, though you will still see either non-tailored ads or generic ads but they will not be as relevant to you.
We have set out below how you can control the information we share, and the information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect in the
How to control your ad preferences on our services
section.
How personal information is used for non-tailored ads
Non-tailored ads use very limited personal information. We do not share personal information with Google, and Google and other partner ad technology providers do not use personal information to build a profile about you and your interests to select, display and measure ads. However, non-tailored ads do require Google to store and access information on your device to technically deliver non-tailored ads, to combat fraud and abuse, to prevent you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and for aggregated ad reporting. If you disable this information storage and access as detailed in
Customising your preferences
you will receive only generic ads.
How to control your ad preferences on our services
You can control whether you receive tailored ads as detailed in
Customising your preferences
section. More specifically in relation to Google, to opt out or revoke consent (where applicable), you can:
Disable information storage and access to your device by Google and other partner ad technology providers. If you disable this for Google, you will only receive generic ads on our services.
Control the inclusion of your Advertising Information within audience segments shared with Google to tailor ads on our services (as described above).
Control the personal information and other information Google independently collects and uses about you by following Google’s instructions here.
3. CUSTOMISING YOUR PREFERENCES
You can customise cookie and advertising settings at any time from the Settings section of the DAZN platform here. You can also accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings on your Internet browser or device.
The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is an industry body that develops standards and guidelines to support online business processes. It has produced a website (
www.allaboutcookies.org
) which explains how cookies work and how they can be managed. However, if you use your browser or device settings to block and or disable all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our services.
4. CHANGES TO THIS COOKIE NOTICE
We keep this notice under regular review to ensure it reflects how we process your personal information, including changes to our processing purposes, your rights in respect of your personal information, and substantive or material changes to how we process personal information. We will take proactive measures to notify you of any such changes via an appropriate means to ensure you remain informed, such as emails, and website pop ups.

information on your interaction and use of our services, including your usage Information.
We also collect information through other types of local storage otherwise known as flash cookies for various features of our services (e.g. to remember and apply your last volume settings).

Recognise you and distinguish you from other users, including to identify and set your preferences (e.g. whether you wish to receive tailored ads, personalised content, direct marketing communications, etc.);

Categories of cookies we use
Strictly Necessary (or ‘essential')
:
Necessary for the operation of our service. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your cookie preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of our services will not then work. They do not store any personal information.
Performance
: Enable us to measure and improve our website by collecting, analysing and reporting information on how you and others use it. These cookies and similar technologies collect information in a way that does not directly identify you or anyone else. If you disable these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our services and we won’t be able to properly monitor its performance for you.
Functional
: Help us to provide enhanced functionality and content personalisation on our services. For example, they help us to recognise you when you return to our services, to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences, such as your choice of language. They do not track your browsing activity on third party websites. If you disable these cookies, our enhanced functionality and content personalisation may not function properly.
Targeting
: Set through our services by our third-party advertising partners to improve your ad experience on other sites or apps. They are used by our partners to build a profile of your interests to show you more relevant and personalised marketing communications on other sites or apps, to measure the effectiveness of these marketing communications, and to prevent you from seeing the same ones repeatedly. These cookies and similar technologies do not store personal information that directly identifies you, but instead use a unique identifier to identify your browser or device (e.g. your IP address, MAID or IFA). If you disable these cookies, you will still see marketing communications and ads on other sites or apps, but they will not be as relevant to your interests. We will continue to personalise your experience on our services through cookies you have not disabled.
2. ADVERTISING
Our services are part-funded by the sale of advertising, or ‘ads’. You will see ads when accessing content on our services, but you can control whether and how we and our advertising technology partners use your personal information to make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Ad categories
Tailored
: These store information, or access information that is already stored, on your device, such as advertising identifiers, device identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. They enable the collection of personal information and other information (e.g. your Advertising Information) and, in combination with information independently collected by Google, enable Google and its ad technology providers to manage, deliver and measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services, to stop you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to detect and stop click fraud.
Non-tailored
: These ads are selected, displayed and measured by our ad serving partner, Google. Non-tailored ads involve Google storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookie / mobile identifiers) but otherwise do not use your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make non-tailored ads more relevant to you, we and Google use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our Services.
Generic
: These ads are pre-recorded and inserted by DAZN into the content you access and view. Unlike non-tailored ads generic ads do not involve our ad serving partner, Google, storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookies or other identifiers) or the use of your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make generic ads more relevant to you, we use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our services.
Delivering our ads
We use Google Ad Manager as our ad serving platform for tailored and non-tailored ads.  Subject to any preferences you have expressed – including consent, where required – Google will store and/or access information on your device using its Google tag, SDK or application programming interface (API) integrated with our services in order to perform the following, subject to your preferences:
To create a tailored ads profile about you;
To select tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To deliver tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To measure ad performance of tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;
To stop you seeing the same ad repeatedly;
To detect and combat fraud and abuse.
Where legally required, we will collect your consent for the storage and/or access to information on your device, and the collection, sharing and use of personal information to select, display and/or measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services.
How personal information is used for tailored ads
We understand the importance of transparency in relation to how we and our partner ad technology providers – including Google – use your personal information. The following is a breakdown of the personal information processing activities involved to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
Our partner ad technology providers store and access information on your device to select, display and measure tailored ads. If you opt-out of information storage and access via Settings, you will receive only generic ads.
Subject to your preferences, our ad technology providers will use a combination of the following personal information to build a profile about you and your interests, and to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
We collect Advertising Information about your use of our services, which we then aggregate (or otherwise combine) with Advertising Information of other similar users and subsequently share. We do not provide any direct personal identifiers, or any attributes or behavioural characteristics of the audience segments assigned to you with our partner ad technology providers for the purpose of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.
Our ad technology providers independently collect personal information on the sites you visit, your search history, the apps you use, and other information, which they may combine with the information shared by us in order to work with their own partner ad technology providers to select, display and measure tailored ads on our services. Please note that we do not control and take no responsibility for the personal information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect on third party sites and apps for the purposes of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.
You are always free at any time to opt-out of tailored ads as detailed in
Customising your preferences
, though you will still see either non-tailored ads or generic ads but they will not be as relevant to you.
We have set out below how you can control the information we share, and the information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect in the
How to control your ad preferences on our services
section.
How personal information is used for non-tailored ads
Non-tailored ads use very limited personal information. We do not share personal information with Google, and Google and other partner ad technology providers do not use personal information to build a profile about you and your interests to select, display and measure ads. However, non-tailored ads do require Google to store and access information on your device to technically deliver non-tailored ads, to combat fraud and abuse, to prevent you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and for aggregated ad reporting. If you disable this information storage and access as detailed in
Customising your preferences
you will receive only generic ads.
How to control your ad preferences on our services
You can control whether you receive tailored ads as detailed in
Customising your preferences
section. More specifically in relation to Google, to opt out or revoke consent (where applicable), you can:
Disable information storage and access to your device by Google and other partner ad technology providers. If you disable this for Google, you will only receive generic ads on our services.
Control the inclusion of your Advertising Information within audience segments shared with Google to tailor ads on our services (as described above).
Control the personal information and other information Google independently collects and uses about you by following Google’s instructions here.
3. CUSTOMISING YOUR PREFERENCES
You can customise cookie and advertising settings at any time from the Settings section of the DAZN platform here. You can also accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings on your Internet browser or device.
The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is an industry body that develops standards and guidelines to support online business processes. It has produced a website (
www.allaboutcookies.org
) which explains how cookies work and how they can be managed. However, if you use your browser or device settings to block and or disable all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our services.
4. CHANGES TO THIS COOKIE NOTICE
We keep this notice under regular review to ensure it reflects how we process your personal information, including changes to our processing purposes, your rights in respect of your personal information, and substantive or material changes to how we process personal information. We will take proactive measures to notify you of any such changes via an appropriate means to ensure you remain informed, such as emails, and website pop ups.
