Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the World of Dinosaurs mobile application (the "Service") operated by Â ("us", "we", or "our").

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal

Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies
We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites or apps. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.
We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.
Subscriptions
Some parts of the Service, such as our In-App Purchase titled 'DIRECTORY', are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Subscriptions are offered with a 2-week free trial ("Trial Period") and thereafter billed for $15.99 USD ("Subscription Rate") per year ("Subscription Period"). Prices will vary by country. Subscriptions give you access to lear about more than 950 dinosaurs A to Z. Content will be modified or updated at our discretion. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current Subscription Period and will be billed at the Subscription Rate. Your Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings after purchase (navigate to the following page within iOS Settings: iTunes & App Stores > Tap on Apple ID > View Apple ID > Subscriptions).
Fee Changes
World of Dinosaurs, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription Period.
You will be provided a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
