6. Your
Rights
Some jurisdictions’ laws grant specific rights to users of the Service,
which are set out in this section.
This section entitled “Your Rights” applies to users that are
located in a Relevant Jurisdiction. If you are located in a territory outside a
Relevant Jurisdiction, please refer to the Supplemental Jurisdiction-Specific
Terms for an overview of your rights and how these can be exercised.
The sub-sections entitled “Access”, “Correction”, and “Erasure”
also apply to users that are located in Canada, Argentina and Russia.
You
have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you, depending
on where you are located. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as
set out in more detail below). We must respond to a request by you to exercise
those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may
be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any
of your rights, please contact us at
dpo_aov@proximabeta.com
.
Access
You
have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it,

about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of

(e.g., game play statistics), as described above in the section “
How
We Use Your Personal Information

hold that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information we hold about
you by logging into your account. If you believe we hold any other personal

We
may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data
protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims
or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where
you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made
available publicly on the Service and there are grounds for erasure, we will
use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal
information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.

note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use
it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so

above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try
to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal
information so that they can stop processing it too.

right to object to our processing of your personal information. We will
consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below

INFORMATION FOR PARENTS
Before
your child can use Arena of Valor, you will need to provide your consent to
approve your child’s account set-up and the processing of their personal
information.
What
personal information does Arena of Valor process?
Arena
of Valor is a platform that consists of services including a mobile game and
eSports website.
If
your child successfully signs up to Arena of Valor, this will result in the
collection and sharing of certain personal information:
a
     nickname (for the account);
device
     information (including IP address and device identifiers) which is used to
     register each account, maintain the game environment, ensure optimal
     performance and security, and troubleshoot bugs;
Identifier
     for Vendors (IDFV)/Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which is used solely
     to manage our promotion campaigns (there is no advertising within Arena of
     Valor);
game
     and log data (to save game progress);
GPS
     location sufficient to allow users to play with other players nearest
     their region, reducing latency (but please note that geolocation is not
     sufficient to identify street name and/or name of city or town);
gender
     (if they choose to add this to their profile);
survey
     responses (if they choose to participate in game feedback surveys from
     time to time);
customer
     support information (if they contact customer support);
In-game
     forum information (including comments they post on the forum, if they
     choose to do so);
email
     address;
prize
     distribution information (if they participate in our eSports competitions
     and win any prizes).
You
can review our
Privacy
Policy
for
more details on what personal information we collect and how we use and process
the information.
Does
Arena of Valor process personal information differently for children?
Yes.
In some jurisdictions children will not be able to access certain features –
such as in-game voice chat.
Why
is my consent required?
Certain
jurisdictions require or recommend the consent of a parent or legal guardian
before their child can sign up to a game such as Arena of Valor, where personal
information will be processed. If you do not consent, or withdraw your consent,
we will immediately delete any personal information collected up to that point.
What
method(s) can I use to verify my child’s account?
In
some jurisdictions, including the United States, we ask for date of birth at
registration. We will not allow a child to sign-up without first obtaining
verifiable consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian. As part of this,
we need to verify that you are an adult capable of providing such consent. To
do this, we charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. This process
is handled by Skyblue Enjoy Investment Pte. Ltd. We do not process your credit
card information – only the third party payment processor collects credit card
information. The credit card information is not retained for any reason,
including future purchases or connected to in-app payment functions (if any) in
the game.
What
if I do not consent?
If
you do not consent (including by providing your credit card details for
verification) then your contact information will be deleted.
How do I withdraw my
consent or delete my child’s account?
You can withdraw your
consent or delete your child’s account by emailing us at
dpo_aov@proximabeta.com
. You can
also request a copy of your child’s personal information at any time.
