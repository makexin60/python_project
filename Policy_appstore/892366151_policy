Privacy Policy for Tacx
Last updated: April 29, 2021
Review Previous Policy
Your privacy is important to Tacx, a Garmin company. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you use the Tacx website, services, and desktop and mobile apps.
If you have not yet transitioned your Tacx account to a Garmin account, the processing related to accounts and new activity data described in this privacy policy and the Garmin Connect privacy policy is not yet applicable to your account until transitioned to a Garmin account. You can find the Tacx privacy notice applicable to these legacy Tacx accounts
here.
Note that the Tacx website, services, and desktop and mobile apps are not intended for use in China.
Other Garmin websites, services, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, we have a separate privacy policy that applies to
Garmin Connect
and its compatible wearables and other devices.

Personal data that is processed when you create a Garmin account:
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.
Purposes and Legal Grounds:
(a) Garmin processes your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
(b) Garmin also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Garmin website or app or engage with other Garmin users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.
(d) Garmin also processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
(e) Garmin also processes your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.

Purposes and Legal Grounds:
This information is used to calculate the calories you burn during an activity and to enable you to show your Connections the types of activities you participate in if you wish.

If you reside in the EEA, U.K., or Switzerland, the legal ground for this processing is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time within your Garmin account.
(b) If you choose to upload indoor cycling activity data generated by your Tacx trainer device to your Garmin account and you choose to participate in Insights, then you will be presented with an Insights section in your Garmin account in which you will be provided with recommendations and motivational messages, information and links to articles that may be of interest to you based upon your activity data, and a comparison of your activity data with aggregated activity data of others in the Garmin Connect community. If you reside in the EEA, U.K., or Switzerland, the legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time within your Garmin account.
(c) Garmin also processes your indoor cycling activity data, if you choose to upload it to Garmin, in an aggregated manner to analyze usage and trends and develop or improve features and services. The legal ground for this processing is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing relevant and quality features and services.
