The type of information we collect
We collect two types of information from our users.
The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“Non-personal Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected.
•	Technical information: In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience, we collect technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name from which you linked to the Services; etc.).

•	Anonymous information: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.
The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“Personal Information”). Such information may include:

At all times, we will abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of the social platform.

When you provide us with access to your Contacts, you acknowledge and agree that we may use such information as part of the Services, as described in this Privacy Policy and you confirm that you have the rights and permissions to provide such access to your Contacts. Similarly, when you provide us with permissions and access to your social network account, we may access and use your friends list for the purpose of the Services (both the Contacts and the social network’s friend list will be defined hereunder as “Contact Information”). Please note that at any time, you or any of your Contacts can choose to opt-out from having their Contact Information enhanced, managed or shared by us, by following the instructions below (under “Opt-out options”).

•	Device Information: We may also collect Personal Information from your device.  Such information includes geolocation data, IP address and other information which relates to your activity through the Services.
How we collect information
There are four main methods we may use to collect information about you:
•	We collect information through your use of the Services. In other words, when you are using our Services, we are aware of it and may gather the information relating to such usage (e.g. your call logs and Contacts).
•	We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect Personal Information which you provide when you register an account, perform an in-app purchase, interact with our customer support, share information within a group of Contacts; etc.)
•	We collect information through third party platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google) when you connect to our Service via these platforms.

For example, we use open web services and public API’s (such as social networks) to complete and update our database.
Google Analytics
We may use third party services for performance tracking and measurement such as Google Analytics, Flurry Analytics, Fabric or other third party services that may use some of the Non-Personal Information for analyzing and statistic purposes.
Google Analytics collects information such as how often users access the Service, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Service. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information.

We may also disclose to our affiliates and business partners (or permit their access to) Contact Information obtained in Elinasoft Database for the purposes of ensuring that their current contact information is up to date.  We will not disclose Contact Information to business partners for the purpose of enriching their data with new Contacts, but merely provide them Contact Information which will help them to check if their existing contact information is up to data and provide them with our current Contact Information.
