Marine
Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use our marine websites and applications.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
When you use Garmin marine products, websites, and apps, we ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, contact information, location, and device information — so you can use your account, receive personalized support, and get the most out of our sites, apps, and products.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.
When You Participate in the ActiveCaptain Community
Interacting with the ActiveCaptain Community, through the website or app, gets you the best fishing and boating information from people like you. When you add reviews and comments or earn points, we use data such as your captain name or email address to make sure you get the credit you deserve and the points you’ve earned.
When You Participate in the Quickdraw Community
We can all agree that location plays a big role in the survey data you use and upload to Quickdraw Contours within the Quickdraw Community. We collect that data, but we add it anonymously to the Quickdraw Contours database. Your personal information is not associated with it at that point — just the location.
When You Use the OnDeck Service
We may collect the names, email addresses, or phone numbers for the people you want to have access to the service. That way, they’ll get notifications when you set up or make changes to the account. If you don’t add them as a contact or owner, we won’t collect anything. We just want to make sure you and the people you add get the most out of the service.
When You Sync to Your Garmin Account
When you sync your device, we process your saved waypoints and routes. That way, your data will stay the same across all your devices.
When You Purchase a Subscription
Subscriptions require a little more information to make sure we can deliver the services you’re purchasing. So, when you get an OnDeck or ActiveCaptain Business Program subscription, we collect your name, business name, email address, billing address, and telephone number, which are used to deliver the services you’re paying for and to send you the billing information you need.
We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Buy, Register, or Update Charts and Devices
We use your credentials and device information to get downloaded maps or map cards onto your devices, to register new devices to your Garmin account, and to provide quality customer service.
We have a third party process your payment information, but Garmin does not store your payment card details.
When You Add or Are an Emergency Contact
If you set up emergency contacts on your Garmin device, your location and other emergency information will be sent or communicated to that contact in the event of an incident.
If a Garmin user adds you as an emergency contact to their Garmin account, they provide us your phone number or email address so you can be reached in the event of an incident.

Why do we ask for your personal data?
From providing product support to getting you the latest software, any information we ask you for is used to improve your experience.
Learn more
To Keep You Informed
When we have something important to tell you about your products, apps, subscriptions, or account — such as vital safety information, app updates, new products or deals, and updates to our privacy policy — we use collected contact information to reach you.
To Improve Our Sites and Apps
When you visit our sites or use our apps, we collect information — such as your IP address, location, times that you visit, and more — to let us know how people navigate our sites and apps and how we can improve them.
To Give You Information You Might Actually Find Interesting
We use things such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar tools to help us provide better, more relevant content on our sites.
We also use these tools to see how effective our ads are and to identify any problems that we need to fix. All in all, we just want to give you websites worth browsing.

Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we and other Garmin-owned companies, including Garmin Services, Inc., process your personal data when you use our marine websites, apps, products, and services, including the ActiveCaptain® Community, the ActiveCaptain® app, OnDeck™, STRIKER™ Cast, Navionics® apps, and the Garmin Quickdraw™ Community.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
When you participate in the ActiveCaptain Community or submit Community Edits, we process your captain name or nickname and email address.
When you participate in the Garmin Quickdraw™ Community, we process location data.
When you purchase, register, or update charts or devices, we process authentication credentials and device information, such as device identifiers.
When you sync your device or app to your account, we process information such as your saved waypoints, routes, tracks, markers, vessel photos and details, or other usage information.
If you choose to enable the live location feature within apps that support this functionality, such as the Navionics Boating app, you have the ability to share your live location with selected Connections. When you initiate a live location sharing session, we collect your real-time location information and share it with the desired Connections. We will only collect and share your real-time location with the selected Connections while the location sharing session is active. Location sharing sessions last up to 24 hours, but you can end the session at any time through the app to stop sharing your location with those Connections.
If you choose to enable the data sharing feature within apps that support this functionality, such as the Navionics Boating app, you have the ability to share items saved in your account, such as tracks, routes, or markers, with selected Connections. When you choose to share an item, we will make the item available to your desired Connections in their accounts. You can change the visibility of the item at any time through the app to stop sharing with those Connections; however, if a Connection has saved a copy of the item in their own account, changing the visibility of your item will not remove the copy that your Connection has made.
When you claim your business via the ActiveCaptain® Business Program, we ask you to provide your ActiveCaptain® account information and your name. If you wish to grant or revoke access to additional business users, we ask you to provide their ActiveCaptain® names.
When you use the OnDeck™ product and services, we may collect information such as name, email address, or phone number for desired contacts or owners.
If a Garmin user adds you as an alert recipient to their Garmin account, they provide us your phone number or email address.
When you sync your device directly or through a compatible Garmin app, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), and device battery level.
When you purchase a product, service, or subscription, we collect your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and telephone number. We do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by third-party service providers. When you purchase a subscription through your app store provider (e.g., Apple, Google), they will collect certain personal data, such as your name, email address, and payment information. Garmin will receive personal data such as your name and email address, but we do not view or store your payment card information, which is handled by the applicable app store provider.
We take steps to identify, detect, and mitigate fraud and abuse on our services, websites, and apps. If we suspect a fraudulent request or claim has been made relating to your account or device, we may process data relating to the device(s) associated with your account, basic account information such as email address, name, phone number(s), and mailing address(es), or our communication history with you in order to adequately investigate the request or claim. We may process content that you have contributed to your account, such as activities, photos, comments, and reviews, to develop and test measures to help identify, detect, and mitigate disruption and damage to our services, websites, and apps potentially caused by or related to such content, to enforce our terms of use, to identify and remove inappropriate, harmful, or abusive content, and for related purposes.
Categories of Recipients of Personal Data
When you provide the contact information of one or more alert recipients to us, we will send a notification via SMS or email to your alert recipient(s) with information about the triggered alert when an event is detected by your Garmin device.
If you interact with a link provided on a claimed business POI, such as a "Contact Us" or "Like us on Facebook" button, the business owner may collect personal information once you are redirected to the destination of the link. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of the destination pages. Business owners are provided aggregated daily POI views for their claimed business POIs.
Your profile information, such as name, profile photo, boat details, activities, and Connections, will be visible to other users in Connections search results, when viewing your profile, or when viewing Community Edits you've made where you've made your nickname visible. You can adjust the visibility of some profile information within your privacy settings.
We use Google address verification to ensure that billing addresses are entered correctly when setting up subscription services. We may also employ third parties to perform debt collection services for delinquent accounts.
We use cloud services from third parties such as
MoEngage
and
SendGrid
, a
Twilio

Those services track the activities associated with these emails, such as whether they were opened, whether links in the emails were clicked on, and whether purchases were made following clicks on those links. We use this data to analyze the level of engagement with our emails.
We use services from third parties such as
Vonage
and
Twilio
to send SMS messages to our users or their contacts in support of features described in this Privacy Policy. We may track the delivery of these messages based on the phone number of the recipient and the selected content.  We use other SMS vendors in some regions, such as

We use third-party service providers to help us better understand the usage and performance of our products, services, websites, and apps. See the "Monitoring and Analytics" section for more information.
We may process and disclose personal data about you to others: (a) if we have your valid consent to do so; (b) to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, such as a valid subpoena, court or judicial order, other valid legal process, or record keeping to support applicable reporting and auditing requirements; (c) to investigate potential fraud and enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; (d) as necessary to pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims.
We may also transfer your personal data to an affiliate, a subsidiary, or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, provided that any such entity that we transfer personal data will not be permitted to process your personal data other than as described in this Privacy Policy without providing you notice and, if required by applicable laws, obtaining your consent.
