the Spotify
Terms of Use
, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app
Other resources and settings
Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:
Privacy Center
: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See
Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'
for more on user rights.
Account Privacy
: Control the processing of certain personal data, including
tailored advertising
.

2. Your personal data rights and controls
Many privacy laws give rights to individuals over their personal data. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation, or
'GDPR'
.
Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in
Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'
.
The table below explains:
your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them

Request access to the personal data we process about you.
To request a copy of your personal data from Spotify, either:
use the “Download your data” tool on your
Account Privacy

legal basis
of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section ‘Object’ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing
There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:
it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotify’s interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account
There are several ways you can erase personal data from Spotify:
to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request erasure of your other personal data from Spotify, follow the steps on our
support page
. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in

Tailored advertising controls
What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.
How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising on your
Account Privacy
page under 'Tailored Ads'.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.
If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads on your
Account Privacy
page, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
Appropriate age for tailored advertising:
The appropriate age for tailored advertising is determined by the country you are in and what rules apply to tailored advertising in that country. You will not receive Tailored Ads unless you have reached the appropriate age.
You will not be able to 'opt-in' to Tailored Ads if you are under the appropriate age.
You will start to receive Tailored Ads once you reach the appropriate age for your country. When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know. This message will contain a link to the
Account Privacy
page where you can change your preferences or 'opt-out' of Tailored Ads at any time.

6. Data retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes
Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:
Data retained until you remove it
It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Erasure' in
Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'
for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.
You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted
We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalised recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.
Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
to help ensure user safety, or
to protect against harmful content on our platform.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our
User Guidelines
and
Platform Rules
. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU
To ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:
Standard Contractual Clauses
('
SCCs
'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in
Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you'
to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by
contacting us
or the third party who processes your personal data.
Adequacy Decisions
. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in
Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you'
to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to:
use a strong password which you
only
use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on
protecting your account
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on
your account page
.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.
It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.
9. Children
Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the
Spotify Kids Privacy Policy
says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a
Spotify Kids
account.
If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify,
contact us
.
If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.
10. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.

1. About this Policy
This Policy describes how we process your and your child's personal data when using Spotify Kids. The aim of this Policy is to explain how Spotify gives your child a great experience when using Spotify Kids, and in particular to:
Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you and your child when using Spotify Kids, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
Explain the additional privacy and security measures and controls we have implemented for Spotify Kids in order to provide a good environment for your child; and
Explain the available rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and your child when using Spotify Kids, and how we will protect the privacy of your child.
This information can also be found in our
Kids resource
, designed to be understood by the older children using Spotify Kids.
The
Spotify® Premium for Family Terms and Conditions
is a separate document outlining the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Premium Family Plan, including Spotify Kids.
2. Parental controls and security
We are committed to protecting your and your child's personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your child's personal data; however, be aware that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.
To help ensure a good environment for your child when using Spotify Kids, we've also implemented the following controls:
Parental protection
- in order to access and enable certain functions in Spotify Kids, such as creating or deleting a child's account and changing the account settings, you as a parent need to provide a verification code. This allows you to control what features your child may use on Spotify Kids and prevents your child from changing settings by themselves.
Appropriate content
- Spotify Kids will only contain age-appropriate content, selected by our editors. At account setup, you will have the option to select what kind of content your child's Spotify Kids account should contain.
In the
Spotify Privacy Policy
you can learn more about the rights and preferences applicable to any of your personal data which is processed by Spotify. You can, at any time, access the personal data associated with the Spotify Kids account. In addition, you can always request that we delete the personal data associated with the Spotify Kids account. If you request deletion of your own Spotify account, the personal data associated with the Spotify Kids account will automatically be deleted.
If you have any questions about your child's privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the "
Contact Us
" form on the Privacy Center. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity. You also have the right to contact the
Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection
or your local data protection authority about any questions or concerns.
