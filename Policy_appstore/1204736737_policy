Privacy Policy for BariBuddy
1. Who We Are
FitForMe Nordics AB ("FitForMe") is a Swedish company (reg. no. 556939-2151) responsible for the BariBuddy app. We manage and protect your personal data in compliance with GDPR.
2. What Data We Collect
We collect personal data that you provide when using the BariBuddy app, including:
Account Creation:
Email, password, name, date of birth, gender, country, surgery details (date, type, clinic), weight, height, and supplement usage.
Optional Information sensitive health data:
Weight progress, physical activity (manual or synced via Google health connect/Apple Health), supplement intake, quiz/questionnaire responses.
App Usage Data:
Non-personal usage data for improving services, collected through Google Analytics.
3. How We Use Your Data
We use the data to provide personalized app services (tracking progress, setting goals, and supporting your post-surgery journey) and to improve app functionality. Your data is used only with your consent.
4. Data Sharing
We share data only with service providers (i.e., AWS for data storage, Twilio for email services) under strict contractual obligations to protect your data.
Other users can only see limited information (e.g., name, step count) when you explicitly accept and join app challenges.
5. Data Retention and Deletion
We store your data as long as your account is active. You can delete your account within the app at any time, which anonymizes your data.
6. Your Rights
You have the right to:
Access your data
Correct or delete your data
Restrict data processing
Withdraw consent at any time
Request data portability
To exercise these rights, contact us at admin@baribuddy.com.
7. International Data Transfers
If data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we use EU-approved safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to ensure it remains protected.
8. Data Security
We use technical safeguards to protect your data during storage and transmission.
9. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We will notify you if significant changes are made to this policy.
10. Contact Information
For privacy-related questions, contact our Data Protection Officer at admin@baribuddy.com.
