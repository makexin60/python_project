In addition, we process personal data from you and other persons, to the extent permitted and deemed appropriate, for the following purposes, where we (and sometimes third parties) have a legitimate interest aligned with the respective purpose:
Offering and enhancing our products, services, and online platforms where we are present (such as the online shop, customer accounts, seminars, and the online academy);

We also disclose personal data to third parties as part of our business activities and for the purposes mentioned above, to the extent permitted and appropriate, either because they process the data on our behalf (data processing arrangement) or because they wish to use the data for their own purposes (data disclosure) or if you have given us your consent to do so.

In particular, you must expect your data to be transferred to other countries in Europe and the USA, where some of the IT service providers we use are located. If we transfer data to a country that does not have an adequate legal level of data protection (such as the USA), we require that the recipient takes appropriate measures to protect personal data (e.g. by agreeing to EU standard clauses, current version available here, other arrangements or based on legitimate grounds).
3.4 Duration of data processing
We process personal data as long as it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations or otherwise for the purposes pursued by the processing, for example for the duration of the entire business relationship (from the initiation, processing to termination of a contract) and beyond in accordance with legal retention and documentation obligations. It is possible for personal data to be retained for the period in which claims can be asserted against us and to the extent that we are otherwise legally obliged to do so or legitimate interests require this (e.g. for evidentiary and documentation purposes). As soon as your personal data are no longer required for the purposes mentioned above, the data will erased or anonymised.
In addition, we will erase your data if you request us to do so using the email address listed in Section 1.1, provided that we do not have a legal or other obligation to retain or secure this data.

The Google Tag Manager is an auxiliary service and only processes personal data for technical purposes and ensures that other tags are triggered, which in turn may collect data.

Google help section

4.5.2 Google Analytics
Based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in the cookie settings, we use the website analysis service Google Analytics 4 for the purpose of analysing our website and its visitors as well as for marketing and advertising purposes.
Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) and enable your use of our website to be analysed. This allows us to evaluate usage behaviour on our website and use the statistics/reports obtained to make our offering more interesting.
In Google Analytics 4, the anonymization of IP addresses is activated by default. This means that your IP address will be shortened by Google within Switzerland or the EU/EEA before transmission. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server and truncated there.
Google uses this information to analyse your usage of our website, generate reports about activities on this website for the website operators and to provide additional services related to the use of this website and the internet. According to Google, Google will not associate your IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data held by Google. When you visit our website, your user behaviour is recorded in the form of events (such as page views, interaction with the website or your "click path") as well as other data such as your approximate location (country and city), technical information about your browser and the devices you use or the referrer URL, i.e. through which website/advertising material you came you came to our website).
The data collected using Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months.
You can prevent the collection and transmission of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of our website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the
browser add-on to opt out from Google Analytics

4.5.3 Google Ads
Based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in the cookie settings, we use Google Ads, an online advertising program from Google. Google Ads uses cookies to analyse the use of our website. A cookie is set if you came to our website through a Google ad. Cookies of this type have a limited validity, do not contain any personal data and are therefore not used for personal identification. When you visit specific pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can identify that you have clicked on the advertisement and have been directed to this website.
We also use the remarketing function of Google Ads. This allows us to show visitors to our website interest-based advertising on other websites within the Google advertising network, such as YouTube or Google Ads. For this purpose, the interactions of our website visitors are analysed (e.g. which products they were interested in) so that we can show them targeted advertising on other websites even after they have left our website. To make this possible, Google sets cookies when you visit certain Google services or websites within the Google advertising network. The cookies are used to uniquely identify the browser used and not to identify a person.
You have the option to opt-out from interest-based advertising by Google or by not giving your consent in the cookie settings. To do this, you must configure the appropriate
personalised advertising settings
on all browsers you use.

This information may be passed on by Google to Google's contractual partners. However, Google will not combine your IP address with other personal data stored about you.

For more information about how AdSense works, please visit the "
Google AdSense
" website.
4.5.5 Google Marketing Platform
Based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in the cookie settings, we use Google's online marketing tool Google Marketing Platform ("GMP"). GMP uses cookies to show ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reporting, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads multiple times. Google uses a cookie ID to record which advertisements are shown in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed multiple times.
In addition, GMP can use cookie IDs to record conversions, i.e. whether a user sees a GMP ad and later visits the advertiser's website and buys something there. According to Google, GMP cookies do not contain any personal information.
Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. According to Google, through the integration of GMP, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you're registered with a Google service, Google may link your visit with your user account. Even if you are not registered with Google or you are not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find and store your IP address. When using Google GMP, personal data may also be transmitted to the servers of Google in the USA.
You can prevent the tracking process by setting your browser software accordingly or by adjusting your
settings for personalised advertising
or by not giving your consent in the cookie settings.
For more information on how GMP works, please visit the "
Google Marketing Platform
" website.
4.5.6 Google Maps/Google Street View
To integrate interactive maps on our website and to provide you with virtual tours, we use the online map service Google Maps or Google Street View based on your consent.
When you access a website on which Google Maps maps are embedded or when you start a virtual tour, Google Maps or Google Street View will set a cookie. This cookie is usually not deleted when you close the browser, but only expires after a certain period of time unless you delete it manually beforehand.
By using Google Maps or Google Street View, information about your use of our website (including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Google may store this data as usage profiles for the purposes of tailoring services, advertising and market research. When you are logged into Google, your data will be directly linked with your account. If you do not wish this, you must log out first.
If you do not agree to this processing of your information, you have the option of blocking these services by deactivating JavaScript in your browser or by not giving your consent in the cookie settings. However, the former can also affect other functions of our website.

You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account before visiting our website.

4.6 Facebook Pixel, Custom Audiences and Facebook conversions
If you have your habitual residence in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, our website uses Facebook Pixel, a service provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. domiciled in Ireland. The parent company is Meta Platforms Inc., based in the USA ("Meta"). Instagram is also an product from Meta.
The legal basis for the use of Facebook Pixel is your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in the cookie settings.
With the help of the Facebook Pixel, it is possible for Meta to identify the visitors to our online offerings as a target group for the display of advertisements (known as "Facebook ads" or "Instagram ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display Facebook and Instagram ads only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offerings or exhibit certain characteristics (e.g. interest in specific topics or products determined based on visited websites), which we transmit to Meta (known as "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the Facebook Pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook and Instagram ads correspond to the potential interest of users and do not appear annoying. With the help of the Facebook Pixel, we can also track the effectiveness of Facebook and Instagram ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users are redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook or Instagram ad (known as "conversions").
Data processing by Meta takes place under the terms of
Facebook's data policy
. Here you can find general information about the display of Facebook and Instagram ads.
By using cookies, Meta can then recognise you in the member area of Facebook or Instagram and optimise the efficiency of advertisements, e.g. by offering advertisements tailored to target groups. The prerequisite for this is that you have a Facebook and/or Instagram account and are logged in to the Facebook or Instagram member area. If you are not a member of Facebook or Instagram, you are not affected by this data processing.
General information on the use of data by Meta, your rights in this regard and options for protecting your privacy can be found in
Facebook's data policy
or
Instagram's privacy policy

Facebook advertising settings
or
Instagram's privacy settings
. To do this, you must be logged into Facebook or Instagram.
If you do not have a Facebook or Instagram account, you can also object to the use of cookies that are used for reach measurement and advertising purposes through the
opt-out page of the Network Advertising Initiative
and also on the US website
YourAdChoices
or the European website
Your Online Choices

4.7 LinkedIn Conversion Tracking
Based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time using the cookie settings, we use conversion tracking technology on our website from the LinkedIn Corporation domiciled in the USA, or if you have your habitual residence in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company domiciled in Ireland ("LinkedIn").
We use LinkedIn technology for marketing and optimization purposes, in particular, to analyse the use of our website, to continuously improve individual functions and offers as well as the user experience, and to display advertisements that are relevant and interesting to you. We also receive aggregated and anonymous reports of ad activity and information about how you interact with our website from LinkedIn. To do this, LinkedIn uses a Javascript code (insight tag), which in turn stores a cookie in your web browser or uses a pixel.
According to LinkedIn, the LinkedIn Insight tag collects data about the use of our website, including URL, referrer URL (i.e. the website from which you visit our website), IP address, device and browser characteristics (user agent). as well as timestamps. Data collected through the LinkedIn Insight tag is encrypted, IP addresses are shortened, and members' direct IDs are removed within seven days to pseudonymise the data. This remaining pseudonymised data will then be deleted within 90 days. LinkedIn does not share any personal data with the website operator, but only provides summarised reports on the website target group and display performance.
Due to LinkedIn's structures, it cannot be ruled out that your data will also be transferred to LinkedIn in the USA. We have minimised this risk as much as possible by using suitable data protection instruments (EU standard contracts).
Further information about the type, purpose and scope of data processing can be found in
LinkedIn's privacy policy
,
cookie policy
and
data protection portal
. You can also object to personalised (LinkedIn) advertising by installing an
opt-out cookie
, regardless of whether you are a LinkedIn member or not.
4.8 Vimeo
To integrate videos on our website, in addition to YouTube (see Section 4.9.7 above), we use plugins from the video portal Vimeo Inc., based in the USA ("Vimeo").
If you access a page on our website that contains this social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with Vimeo servers. The content of the plugin is then transmitted by Vimeo directly to your browser and embedded into the page. By integrating the plugin, Vimeo receives the information that your browser has accessed a particular page on our website, even if you do not have Vimeo account, or you are currently not logged into Vimeo. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a Vimeo server in the USA and stored there.
If you are logged into Vimeo, Vimeo will be able to link your visit to our website to your Vimeo account. If you interact with the plugins (such as clicking the start button on a video), this information is also transmitted directly to a Vimeo server and stored there.
If you do not want Vimeo to associate the data collected on our website directly with your Vimeo account, you must log out from Vimeo before visiting our website.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is your consent, which you do not have to give as part of the cookie settings. If you have given us your consent to use Vimeo, you can withdraw this at any time with effect for the future in the cookie settings.
For more information on the purpose and scope of collection, further processing and the use of data by Vimeo as well as your rights and the options available to protect your privacy, please refer to
Vimeo's privacy policy
.
4.9 Adform
Based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in the cookie settings, we use tracking points from Adform, domiciled in Denmark. The data collected remains anonymous. This means that individual user data cannot be viewed. However, the collected data is stored and processed by Adform in encrypted form. We cannot use this data to identify individual visitors to our websites. We will inform you about this matter according to our current information.
These tracking points allow JURA to show users tailored advertising.
Our websites also use cookies and products from Adform A/S (Ad Server, DSP and DMP) for target group-oriented advertising in joint processing. For this purpose, various parameters such as pages viewed, device type, geographical origin, last visited websites are recorded and visitors are grouped into different segments. With the help of statistical analyses, similar users are then found in the global Adform cookie pool in order to address them with targeted advertising from JURA.
Further information about Adform can be found in their
privacy policy
.
4.10 Dynatrace
Our website uses the analysis tool from the monitoring service Dynatrace LLC, 1601 Trapelo Road, #116 Waltham, MA 02451 USA. We use Dynatrace to ensure the performance of our website and to understand how users navigate our website. Dynatrace records W3C response times, button clicks, link clicks, JavaScript errors, browser type and geographical region. This data helps us to continually improve the performance of our website and to identify or resolve functional problems. In order for this to work correctly and effectively, Dynatrace requires cookies. The legal basis for our use of Dynatrace is your consent, which you can withdraw at any time using the cookie settings.
We would like to point out that there is no equivalent level of data protection in the USA and, in particular, access to data processed there or by US companies or their foreign subsidiaries worldwide may be viewed by US authorities or may have to be disclosed to them. As a non-US citizen, you may not be able to take action against this or not effectively. We have minimised this risk as much as possible by using suitable data protection instruments (EU standard contracts), but we cannot completely rule it out, so your consent to the use of Dynatrace also entails this risk.
You can ensure that no personal data is collected by activating the do-not-track function in your browser.
5 Social media presence
We maintain social media profiles on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn.
The data you enter on our social media profiles will be published by the social media platform and will not be used or processed by us for any other purposes at any time. However, we reserve the right to delete content if this is necessary. If necessary, we will communicate with you through the social media platform.
Be aware that the operator of the social media platform uses web tracking methods. Web tracking, over which we have no influence, can also occur regardless of whether you are logged in or registered with the social media platform.
More detailed information on data processing by the provider of the social media platform can be found in the privacy policy of the respective provider:
Facebook Meta Platforms Inc.
Instagram Meta Platforms Inc.
YouTube LLC
LinkedIn Corporation
6. Your rights
You have the right, under applicable data protection laws and to the extent provided therein (such as in the case of the GDPR), to information, rectification, erasure, restriction of data processing, and to object to our data processing, especially for purposes of direct marketing, profiling carried out for direct advertising purposes, and other legitimate interests in processing, as well as the right to receive certain personal data for transfer to another controller (known as data portability).
Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce the restrictions provided for by law, for example if we are obliged to store or process certain data, have an overriding interest in doing so (to the extent that we are entitled to rely on this) or use them for the assertion of requirements. If you incur any costs, we will inform you in advance. We have already provided information about the possibility of revoking your consent in Sections 3 and 4.3. Please note that exercising these rights may conflict with contractual agreements and this may have consequences such as early termination of the contract or cost implications. We will inform you in advance if this is not already contractually stipulated.
The exercise of such rights generally requires that you provide clear proof of your identity (e.g. by providing a copy of your ID, where your identity is otherwise not clear or cannot be verified). To assert your rights, you can contact us at the address given in Section 1.1.
Every data subject also has the right to enforce their claims in court or to lodge a complaint with the responsible data protection authority. The responsible data protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (
http://www.edoeb.admin.ch
).
7 Data security
We take technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised persons and to ensure the protection of your rights and compliance with the applicable data protection regulations.
The measures taken are intended to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data and to ensure the long-term availability and resilience of our systems and services when processing your data. They are also intended to ensure the rapid restoration of the availability of personal data and access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident.
Our security measures also include encryption of your data. Data traffic through this JURA website is encrypted using HTTPS. This means that all information that you enter online is transmitted through an encrypted transmission path. This means that this information cannot be viewed by unauthorised third parties at any time.
Our data processing and security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments.
We also take our own internal company data protection very seriously. Our employees and any service providers we engage are subject to a duty of professional secrecy and are obliged to comply with data protection laws and regulations. Furthermore, access to personal data is only granted to the extent they need it to fulfil their duties.
8 Use of the website by minors
The website is aimed at an adult audience. Minors, especially children under the age of 16, are prohibited from transmitting personal data to us or registering for a service without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. If we discover that such data has been transmitted to us, it will be deleted from our database. The child's parents (or legal representatives) can contact us and request deletion or deregistration. To do this, we need a copy of an official document that identifies you as a parent or legal guardian.
9 Links to websites of other providers
Our website also contains links to the websites of partners and authorised JURA specialist dealers. If there are links to websites of other providers, we have no influence on their content. Therefore, we cannot accept any responsibility or liability for this content. The respective provider or operator of these sites is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for potential legal violations and identifiable infringements at the time the links to these websites were created. At that time, we were not aware of any illegal content on these external websites. At the same time, it is not reasonable to expect us to monitor the content of linked pages on a continuous basis without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. As soon as we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will remove such links immediately.
We use cookies on our website. Some cookies are essential to the operation of the site while others help to integrate external content or improve the user experience (statistics). For more info about cookies and how to disable them,
