You must do this on each browser and each device you use in order to fully opt out.
EUROPEAN AND UK RIGHTS
This section of this Privacy Policy applies only if you use the App or UMG websites from a country that is a Member State of the European Economic Area and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.

Legal Basis for Data Processing:
We process personal data for the purposes set out in the relevant privacy policy. Our legal bases to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the App); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the App); and based on the consent of our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings found in our emails/Apps or by contacting UMG as described above) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
We may use automated decision-making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe may interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with UMG and UMG artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our Apps or interactions with UMG Companies or our third-party partners.
In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal data for processing as described above, for us to be able to provide you to use all the features of the App.
International transfers
Our sharing your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by certifying, where required by law, at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
transferring personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
consent of the individual;
adherence to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework, and UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (see details below); or
using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to request a copy of relevant safeguards by contacting UMG as described above

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. While there is no comprehensive industry standard for such signals, certain websites UMG operates attempt to recognize this signal and, if detected, limit our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. Unfortunately, due to the variation in browsers and detection capabilities and the lack of accepted standards we cannot guarantee that transmitting a “do-not-track” signal will result in our disabling cookies and tracking technologies. We recommend using the cookie choices tools on our sites to control UMG’s use of cookies and tracking technologies.
