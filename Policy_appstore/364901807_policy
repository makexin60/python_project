Air Gestures
The App offers an Air Gestures mode within its video player, allowing you to control the player solely through hand gestures, without requiring touch input. Please note that upon closing the App, the Air Gestures mode will deactivate automatically. You will need to manually re-enable this feature in the video player’s settings after reopening the App.
For this feature to function, we will request access to your device’s camera. The camera will be active while the Air Gestures mode is enabled within the video player. Upon exiting the video player, the Air Gestures mode will be temporarily paused.
The Air Gestures utilizes Apple's framework technology to facilitate hand gesture recognition. The technology functions by detecting hand-raising gestures and analyzing the hand pose and the fingers' coordinates within the captured images. Apple then provides the coordinates of your fingers to the App, which processes this data to execute specific commands, such as pausing a video, etc.
Our App does not utilize your data for learning purposes. Additionally, we do not retain or back up any finger coordinates, hand gestures, or other images when the feature is on. These coordinates are processed exclusively on your device and are automatically deleted once the processing is complete.

Audio/Video Transcribe
The App offers Audio/Video Transcribe feature to transcribe speech into the written text.
By default, this feature is turned off and can be enabled via the file's context menu. Upon its first use, the app downloads the AI model required for this functionality from Apple's servers. The transcription algorithm operates directly on your device, ensuring that no data is collected or transmitted externally. After the transcription process is completed, the model stops running. Additionally, any service data generated by the model during transcription is immediately erased once the App saves the text file with the transcription results (this includes the extracted audio file if you transcribe a video). The model is subsequently stored on your device and can be used again for transcribing audio or video files through the file's context menu whenever needed.
We do not utilize the user’s data for learning purposes and do not retain or back up any transcription data when the Audio/Video Transcribe feature is on.
Occasionally, the AI model may make errors in transcription, particularly with languages other than English or when the audio clarity is poor. Additionally, the model does not have restrictions on transcribing content that includes obscenities or various speech styles.

Smart Eraser
The App offers the Smart Eraser feature to remove unwanted objects from the images.
By default, this feature is turned off. Upon its first use, the App downloads the AI model required for this functionality. The algorithm operates directly on your device, ensuring that no data is collected or transmitted externally. It accesses and processes only the image you explicitly choose. Once the erasure process is completed, the model stops running. It is subsequently stored on your device and can be used again through the menu whenever needed.
The feature does not intentionally restrict the size, format, or content of the images it processes. However, there are unspecified technical limitations on the maximum allowable image size, which depend on the characteristics of a particular device and cannot always be predicted.
The output is always saved as a copy of the original file. Also, the output file format will be preserved only for jpeg, png, or heiс files. All other formats will be converted and saved as jpeg.
Occasionally, the AI model may make errors. The model is sensitive to how an object for erasing has been masked, and it tends to produce both good and bad results depending on the input.
We do not use the user’s data for learning purposes and do not retain or back up any images when the feature is on.

communicate with you as described elsewhere in this Privacy Notice.
In addition, we have implemented organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during data transfer to third-party.
We can share your data on the following grounds: consent, compliance with the law, and performance of a contract.
Details
Performance of a contract
. We may transfer your data to our contractors and partners for contractual purposes.
Consent
. We may transfer your personal data based on your explicit consent.
Compliance with the law

Data Transfer Outside the European Economic Area
The personal data we collect is stored on servers in the USA. The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.
There is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding either the US or Ukraine. This means that the USA and Ukraine are not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data. We use adopted Standard Contractual Clauses based on legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage.
You can read more detailed measures to protect your personal data
here
.
However, if a data transfer is required to perform a contract or provide you services, we have the right to do so without your consent.
Security Measures
We systematically perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to ensure that we use an appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
To be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), an alarm system, corporate VPN, and written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).
Moreover, we systematically monitor our technologies’ state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations compliant with the GDPR requirements. You can contact customer support in case of any questions regarding the security issues.

1. Introduction.
At Hotspot Shield, we believe it’s important that everyone, regardless of their situation, can obtain secure and private access to the internet. We always aim to provide this access without compromising the privacy of our customers. Hotspot Shield is provided by Anchorfree, LLC or Pango GmbH, and a part of the
Pango Group
“Pango” (hereinafter referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”).
This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices across the various products, services, applications, and websites that link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our “Services”, or individually as a “Product” or “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies to the access or use of our Services, and you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy if you access or use our Services. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or any provisions hereof, please do not use our Services.
Though many of our Services are made available to consumers directly, some of our Services are offered to businesses or enterprise customers. For those Services, our customer is a business entity or other organization that may authorize individual end users (e.g. employees or customers) to use the Services that it has purchased or licensed from us. Where an organization is our customer, it may maintain accounts with us through which it and its users may submit information (“Customer Data”). In such cases, the organization that purchased or licensed our Services typically controls those accounts associated with their users and the organization may receive some Customer Data in order to maintain the account. In this case, we are generally a processor of Customer Data and the organization is the controller of such Customer Data. See the ‘Disclosure of Information’ section below for additional details.
To contact us, please see the “Contact Us” section below for more information.
2. What Information Do We Collect About You?
This section describes the categories of personal data (or ‘personal information’) we may collect from and/or about you. The types of information described below are not collected in all situations and may vary depending on the Service you use. We collect the applicable information you provide through your use of a Service or Services, or as needed in specific Service-specific situations. For example, as noted in our
VPN Products Privacy Notice,
our VPN Products only collect a limited amount of personal data, and specifies that the collection of any websites or apps visited during a VPN session are not connected to any individual user, and therefore cannot be used for advertising or marketing purposes. Please see our ‘Product Specific Privacy Notices’ section below for more information.
2.1. Information You Provide to Us

If a Service requires, or allows you to create, an account before you can access the Service, then we may collect information such as your name, username, email address, and password as a part of the account registration process.
Billing and Payment Information.
In order to purchase a Service, you may need to provide us and/or our payment processing partners with personal information such as your billing name, billing contact details (such as street addresses and/or email addresses), and payment instrument details. This basic billing information is used for payment processing and refund requests.
Communications and Submissions.
You may choose to provide us with information when you communicate with us (e.g. via email, phone, or chat for support or to inquire about our Services), including when you fill out an online form, respond to surveys, provide feedback, post comments to our website, participate in promotions, or submit information through our Services.

Device information.
We collect information from and about the device you use to access our Services, including information about the browsers and apps you use to access our Services. For example, we may collect device or mobile advertising identifiers, browser types, device types and settings, operating system versions, mobile, wireless, and other network information (such as internet service provider name, carrier name and signal strength), and application version numbers. We may use cookies and other technologies to collect this information See Section 6 for more information on how we use cookies and other technologies.
Diagnostic information.
We may collect information about the nature of the requests that you make to our servers, such as what is being requested, information about the device and app used to make the request, timestamps, and referring URLs.
Approximate location information.
Unless otherwise expressly stated or with your consent, we do not collect your location information based on your device’s GPS or other device sensor data. However, we may collect your approximate location by calculating an imprecise latitude and longitude based on your IP address to provide you with better service (e.g. to connect you to the nearest and fastest VPN server).
VPN Service Specific Information.
Our VPN Products do not log any information that associates your account credentials or identity with your VPN session activity. We do not maintain any records that show what websites you were browsing or apps accessed through a VPN connection. However, we will:
Identify the locations of the VPN servers utilized
Collect similar diagnostic information as referenced above.
Ask you to rate your connection and provide some more detailed survey information if you are not satisfied with the service. Note this information is not tied to a specific user.
We may also assign your device a ‘hash’, which is a random ID generated when you first launch one of our VPN apps. Device hashes are not linked to VPN browsing activity or user identity, but may be used to measure individual user activity.
See Our
VPN Products Privacy Notice
for more information.
2.3. Information Provided to Us by Third Parties.
Third Party Invitation.
If you are invited to use one of our Services, the party who invited you may submit your personal data or contact information, such as your email address, to us.

If you elect to register or enroll in our Services through your third-party account, that third party may send us information about you that they have, such as email address or account identifying information that will enable us to provide our Services to you. What information is shared with us is controlled by the applicable third party that you have an account with. You may be able to control what information they send us via your privacy settings for that third party account.

3. How Do We Use Your Information?
We use the information we collect for various purposes described in this section. For visitors from the European Economic Area (EEA) or U.K., we also describe, below, our lawful basis for processing personal data.
To provide, maintain, troubleshoot, and support our Services.
We use your information for this purpose on the basis that it is required to fulfill our contractual obligations to you. Examples include:
For our VPN Products, using information about how much bandwidth you use and how long you use our Services in order to provide the Services in accordance with a plan to which you have subscribed;
For our digital threat platform, using threat and device information to determine whether certain items pose a potential security threat; and
Generally, to ensure the proper functioning of our Services.
For billing and payment purposes.
We use your information in order to perform billing administration activities and process payments, which are required to fulfill our contractual obligations.
To communicate with users and prospective users.
We use your information to communicate with you, including by responding to your requests, and sending you information and updates about our Services. We may do this in order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the communication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with information about our Services.
To improve our Services.
We want to offer you the best Services and user experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually improving and optimizing our Services. To do so, we use your information to understand how users interact with our Services. For example, we (a) analyze certain usage, device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends and user engagement with our Services (and, for example, invest in technical infrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand); (b) may use device and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific research to improve our threat detection capabilities; and (c) review customer feedback to understand how we can improve.
To develop new Services.
We have a legitimate interest in using your information to plan for and develop new Services. For example, we may use customer feedback to understand what new Services users may want.
To market and advertise our Services.
We may use your information to provide, measure, personalize, and enhance our advertising and marketing based on our legitimate interest in offering you Services that may be of interest. For example, we may use information such as who or what referred you to our Services to understand how effective our advertising is; or we may use information to administer promotional activities such as sweepstakes and referral programs. Note that our VPN Products do not use your VPN browsing activity for these purposes and we do not maintain any records that show what you were browsing or accessing through a VPN connection.
To implement security measures and prevent against harm or liability.
We may use information for security purposes (such as to investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent fraud) and to prevent abuse. We may do this to comply with our legal obligations, to protect an individual’s vital interests, or because we have a legitimate interest in preventing harm or liability to us and our users. For example, we may use account, usage, and device information to determine if an entity is engaging in abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our Services.
For compliance with legal obligations.
We may use your information as required to comply with applicable law or regulation, legal process, or other legal obligation to which we are subject. For example, we may be compelled by a contract or court to provide certain information necessary to our business partners in order to fulfill the terms of a business agreement or our legal obligations. We may also use your information to enforce our legal rights and resolve disputes. To learn more about our practices regarding sharing your information with third parties for legal compliance purposes, see Section 4 below.

We may share your information if we are required to do so by applicable law; to comply with our legal obligations; to comply with legal process; and to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may expose us (or affiliates), you, or any of our other users to legal liability. If we share your information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is legally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are unlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid. To reiterate, our VPN Products do not collect information about which websites you visit or apps you use, so this information is not accessible in a law enforcement request.
To enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.
We may share limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our agreements with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against us or our affiliates. We may also share your information in order to protect against fraud and/or abuse against us, our affiliates, users and others.

For more information on how we use cookies, see section 6.1 below.
Pixel Tags / Page Tags / Web Beacons / Tracking Links.
These tools allow us to determine if you perform a specific action on a web page or email message. When you access a page, ad, or email, or click a link, these items let us know that you have accessed that page, opened an email, or clicked a link. They may also indicate your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which enables us to determine your approximate geographic location as assigned by your Internet Service Provider.
Software Development Kits (SDKs) / Software.
This mobile app software is provided by our business partners that enables our mobile apps to interact with the services those partners provide. See section 7 below for more information about how we use SDKs with our Free VPN products to provide advertising services.
6.1 Use of Cookies; Your Choices
In general, we may use cookies in the following ways:
To provide our Services. Some cookies are essential for the proper operation of our Services. For example, cookies allow us to authenticate who you are and whether you’re authorized to access a resource.
To store your preferences. Cookies can store your preferences, such as language preferences or whether to pre-fill your username on sign in forms. We may also use them to optimize the content that we show to you.
For analytics. Cookies are used to inform us how users interact with our Services so we can, as a legitimate interest, improve how they work (such as what screens or webpages you access, and whether our advertising is effective).

7. Use of Advertising Services With Free VPN Products
For users of our free VPN products, we may serve ads through the use of third party advertising services indicated below. As previously noted, neither we nor any third party advertising service has access to the VPN browsing information, such as the websites you visit or apps you use while in a VPN session. However, as with any online advertising service, the entities will have access to the information associated with the ad delivery such as which website or app the ad was delivered to, and the device-specific information listed below.
In order to display ads in our apps, we may utilize third party software development kits (SDKs), which consists of software code provided by a third party and embedded into our apps. These SDKs may collect the following information from your device or use:
Device or mobile advertising identifiers (controlled by your mobile operating system)
Internet Protocol (IP) Address, which may reveal your approximate geographic location as determined by your carrier or ISP. However, when using the VPN service, this may replace your actual location with an alternative geographic location.
Device-specific information such as make, model, OS version, language, time zone and other information.
The name of the app or website serving the ad.
As some of the ads may be personalized based on your mobile advertising identifier or IP address, you may see an AdChoices icon on an ad. You can click this icon to learn more about the ad network that provided the ad, its privacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from any personalized advertising. If you opt out from personalized advertising, you may still see non-personalized ads. While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent the display of ads because that is how we support our free Services, our Services are able to continue functioning if you do use ad blockers.
We may use the following advertising services to provide ads with our free VPN products:

8. Information Security.
We understand the importance of protecting information provided to or collected by us, including personal data, and employ reasonable and appropriate methods (including a range of administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your data such as use of best practices, procedures, policies, training, technology, and oversight) to protect against and reduce the risk of unauthorized access, loss, or release of data. Access to your account or services information is restricted to our employees or contractors who require such access to perform their job functions. While our controls are strong and we strive to protect your personal information through these various means, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information, as no data security measures can guarantee 100% protection. We recommend you take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the Internet or otherwise. You should change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.
9. International Data Transfers.
Depending on where you reside and what Services you use, Pango may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you reside. We do this to facilitate our operations, and transferees include other Pango companies, service providers, and partners. Laws in other countries may be different to those that apply where you reside. For example, personal data collected within the U.K., Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred and processed in the United States for purposes described in this policy. However, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to ensure that such data receives an adequate level of protection, which typically includes Pango and corporate recipients executing the Standard Contractual Clauses (aka ‘Model Contracts’) adopted by the European Commission or UK for such transfers to the U.S.
In addition, Pango Group (including Anchorfree LLC) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Pango has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Pango has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov.
Click here
to view our EU/Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Privacy Policy You may contact us if you would like more information about such safeguards.
If you change your country of residence, the Pango company responsible for your data may change accordingly, and your data may be transferred to that other company.
For users of our VPN products, if you are a UK or EEA resident and you choose to use our software to route your Internet traffic through servers in countries not deemed ‘adequate’ by the UK or EEA, then you acknowledge that such transfers are executed at your direction and with your unambiguous consent.
10. Data Retention.
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is needed to provide the Services to you, or for as long as you have an account or subscription with us. We retain your personal information as reasonably necessary for the respective purpose. In determining the criteria by which to retain or dispose of your information, we consider the type, sensitivity, context, and purpose of collecting the information. We may also retain personal information if required by law, or for our legitimate interests, such as abuse detection and prevention, and defending ourselves from legal claims. Residual copies of personal data may be stored in backup systems for a limited period as a security measure to protect against data loss.
With respect to our VPN Products, we do not collect or retain data about your browsing activity while you are connected to the VPN Services.
11. Your Rights.
Depending on your state or country of residence, you may have certain legal rights with respect to your personal information, subject to exceptions and limitations provided by applicable laws and regulations.
11.1 General.
In general, you may have the following rights to your personal data:
access and receive a copy of your personal data;
correct your personal data;
restrict the processing of your personal data;
object at any time to the processing of your personal data;
have your personal data erased;
data portability;
withdraw any consent you previously gave to the processing of your data (such as opting out to marketing communications);
lodge a complaint with a data protection authority;
request that we provide you with the categories of personal data we collect, disclose or sell about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal data; and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal data. Note some of this information may already be provided in this Privacy Policy.
For clarity, the above describes examples of rights an individual may have. You may have some, but not all of the rights described above, depending on where you reside and what laws and regulations apply to you. Additional U.S. state specific privacy rights are further described below.
You may be able to exercise some of these rights by using the settings and tools provided in our Services. For example, you may be able to update your user account details via the relevant account settings screen of our apps. You may also be able to opt out from receiving marketing communications from us by clicking an “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in such communications.
Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track" or “opt-out preference” signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. Otherwise, if you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below. As permitted by law, we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. You may also be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. If you do so, you must give the authorized agent written permission to make such requests, or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
11.2 Your California Privacy Rights.
The information provided in this Privacy Policy describes the categories of personal information We may collect, process and share with certain service providers and other businesses. If you are a California resident and would like to exercise your rights to receive the specific pieces of information, or other privacy rights applicable to you, please contact us as specified in the ‘Contact Us’ section below.
We do not ‘sell’ personal information for our own monetary benefit. However, as the CCPA defines ‘sell’ broadly, some of the advertising services that support our website, marketing efforts, and mobile applications use third party advertising services that may be deemed a ‘sale’ under California law. Please see Our terms relating to your choices relating to cookies and the app-specific advertising services listed above to indicate your preferences with respect to ads or cookie usage as applicable.
California residents also have the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information if we use that information for purposes beyond what is needed to provide the Services you request or for other reasons specified in the CPPA. As we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for other purposes without your consent, we do not offer you an option to limit the use of sensitive personal information.
11.3 Other U.S. Only State Specific Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have specific or additional rights under your state’s privacy laws.
Depending on the jurisdiction where you reside and the scope of applicability, you may have certain of the following rights with respect to your personal information:
Right to know what personal information we collect, how we use and share it, and how long we keep it.
The state laws generally require that we provide you information about the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which we collect each category. This Privacy Policy provides details about our collection and usage practices. As described in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, we collect personal information when you interact with us and use our Services, from third parties, and from the devices you use. Use of certain identity protection Services may require you to provide information such as social security number, driver’s license, financial account data, or other information that is considered sensitive personal information under state privacy laws. We retain information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes and then securely delete it. We use the information we collect for business and commercial purposes as those terms are defined by the CCPA. Third parties/service providers we use to perform business functions on our behalf may use information for the same purposes.
Right to access, delete and correct information.
You may have the right to request access to your information, or for us to delete or correct your personal information. Please contact us to request that we delete personal information we have about you, or to correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. Unless we need it for reasons specified or permitted by applicable laws or regulations, we will work with you to delete your personal information accordingly. You may also request access to your information, and we will provide the relevant information to you in a portable and readily usable format.
Right to limit the use of sensitive personal information.
For sensitive personal information that we collect, we will only use or disclose it either with your specific consent when required, or as otherwise permitted by law. As we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for other purposes without your consent, we currently do not offer you an option to limit the use of sensitive personal information.
Right to tell us not to use personal information to create profiles about you that we use to inform decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects.
We do not use personal information to profile you to further decisions that have legal or similar significant effects.
Right to tell us not to sell personal information or process it for certain targeted advertising purposes.
The laws vary in the way they define sale and certain targeted advertising, but generally, they require that we provide you with the ability to limit activities that involve sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and using personal information about you from your activity across other websites or apps to target ads to you. You can opt out of certain sharing or processing of your personal information by accessing your privacy preferences page for the applicable Product website. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age.
Right to appeal a denial of your request to exercise the privacy rights provided by the state law.
Some states allow you to appeal a denial of your request to exercise your privacy rights provided by applicable state law. If you are a resident of Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, or Virginia and we deny your request to exercise certain rights pertaining to your personal data, you can appeal the denial of a request to exercise privacy rights by following the instructions listed in the denial communication, by submitting a request through a privacy inquiry to
privacy@anchorfree.com
.
Right to not be discriminated against.
Some state laws ensure that you have the right to not be discriminated against. We do not discriminate against you, or anyone, for your/their exercise of any rights provided to you by applicable state law.
You can exercise your right to know, access, delete, and correct data directly, or, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, and Texas, you may appoint an authorized agent to act on your behalf, by submitting a request. You can exercise your right to opt-out of selling and sharing by visiting the applicable privacy preferences page or the cookie banner for the Service you are using. Note we may require you to verify your identity using the processes we describe in an applicable Product dashboard or the privacy choices page before we fulfill your request.
12. Technology Licensing.
We occasionally license our technology to third party partners who may integrate it with applications developed and offered by those partners. Our partners, and not Anchorfree or Pango Group, are responsible for those applications and for determining what data is collected by those applications and how it is processed. Please contact the relevant partner and refer to their Privacy Policy to learn more about how those applications process your personal data.
13. Age Restrictions.
Our Services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. In this context, minors are individuals under the age of 16 except for our identity and credit monitoring services, which are restricted to those under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors or allow them to use our Services. If we discover that we have collected personal data from a minor, we may delete such data without notice. Please note that the legal terms under which we make certain Services available may require users to be older than 16 years of age.
14. Privacy Policy Updates.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with this section for reasons such as changes in laws, industry standards, and business practices. We will post updates to this page and update the “Last updated” date above. If we make updates that materially alter your privacy rights, we will also provide you with advance notice, such as via email or through the Services. If you disagree with such an update to this policy, you may cancel your Services account. If you do not cancel your account before the date the update becomes effective, your continued use of our Services will be subject to the updated Privacy Policy.

However, we will collect Personal Data only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you and we will endeavor to make that clear at collection.
4. When Amplitude Discloses Personal Data
We may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide to us as described below.
We may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide to us to our subsidiaries and affiliates.
We may share your Personal Data collected from you as described in this Privacy Notice with third-party service providers who need to access the Personal Data in order to perform services on behalf of Amplitude, such as processing or storing such information, securing our Website or Product, or providing analytics services on our behalf. The third-party service providers are limited to using the Personal Data solely to provide the services to us and are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and secure and to use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
If you are part of an Amplitude program that allows you to pay fees with a credit card or debit card and you choose to pay such fees with a credit card or debit card, your credit card or debit card information is provided directly to our third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process the payments. The payment information is transmitted directly via an encrypted connection to Stripe. Stripe uses, processes and stores your Personal Data and payment information in accordance with Stripe’s privacy policy available at stripe.com/us/privacy. Amplitude does not collect or store your payment information. Stripe maintains that it is PCI compliant and you can learn more about Stripe’s security measures available at stripe.com/help/security.
We may share your Personal Data if we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, respond to a court order, subpoena or a government request (such as a search warrant). If a government request or other legal process requires Amplitude to disclose your personal data, then Amplitude will use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notification of the disclosure unless Amplitude is prohibited by law from doing so.
Amplitude also reserves the right to disclose your Personal Data that Amplitude believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: (i) enforce our agreements and policies, including for billing and collection purposes, (ii) protect the security or integrity of the Website or Product; or (iii) protect or defend Amplitude’s legal rights.
In the event that Amplitude is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign your Personal Data as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
Amplitude may disclose anonymized and/or aggregated information about Visitors to the Website or our Customers’ use of the Product that does not identify any individual.
Amplitude makes available our Community Forum and other resources or materials where you may post user generated content. The information you choose to post is publicly available and may be read and collected by others that visit these sections of the Website. Except for the details in your profile (e.g., username), the categories of data disclosed in these circumstances will depend on what information you choose to provide.
Amplitude may disclose Personal Data to third-party business partners at your direction, if you access or request contact from the third-party business partners through the Product or Website or at a marketing event.
Amplitude may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide to us for any purpose disclosed by us when we collect the information or with your consent, such as advertising or marketing providers.
5. Customer End User Data
This Privacy Notice does not apply to Customer End Users, Customer End User Data or Customer Applications.
With respect to the Personal Data collected by our Customers and submitted to the Amplitude platform, Amplitude is a processor and only processes such Personal Data in accordance with the instructions of our Customers. Our Customers may integrate into their mobile applications, websites or other services (collectively, "
Customer Applications
") certain aspects of our Product in order to understand how their own users ("
Customer End Users
") engage with the Customer Applications ("
Customer End User Data
").
Our Customers, not Amplitude, choose the type of Customer End User Data collected by Customer Applications, and submitted and processed through our Customers’ use of the Products. We process the Customer End User Data only according to the instructions of Customers and our legal obligations with respect to the Customer End User Data is set forth in the agreement between us and our Customers. The collection of Customer End User Data through Customer Applications is governed by our Customers’ privacy policies, and if you are a Customer End User then you should review the Customer’s privacy policy to learn more about the Customer’s data handling practices.
While Amplitude recognizes that an individual has the right to access, delete and amend the data collected about that individual, Amplitude only has a relationship with our Customers and does not interact with the Customer End Users. As such, if you are a Customer End User and you would like to access, amend or delete your data, you need to contact the Customer directly with your request which Customer may process. Amplitude will respond within a reasonable period of time to any such request or assistance requested by our Customer.
Amplitude only retains the Customer End User Data we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as necessary to provide the Product to our Customers or as required to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce any agreement.
6. International Transfer
By interacting with the Website or using the Product or otherwise providing information to Amplitude, you understand that your Personal Data may be transferred to the United States or another country other than your country of residence and you consent to such transfer. In order to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection and security, Amplitude has implemented appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of Personal Data, as required by applicable data protection laws. These safeguards include using the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses to protect the transfer of your Personal Data to Amplitude’s corporate affiliates or service providers, if required by applicable law.
Amplitude also remains self-certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. However, it is not currently relying on these frameworks for the transfer of Personal Data.
Amplitude complies with the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, and the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively, in reliance on Privacy Shield. Amplitude has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view the certification for Amplitude, please visit:
https://www.privacyshield.gov/
.
For the actions of third party agents Amplitude engages to process data on our behalf, Amplitude remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party agent processes the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Amplitude proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. Our Commitment To Data Security
Amplitude uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include, for example, physical access controls, encryption, firewalls, and detection and monitoring. Our personnel who may have access to your Personal Data are required to keep that information confidential and trained on their security and privacy obligations.
You, however, are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and other information used by you to access the Website or use the Product. While Amplitude does its best to protect your Personal Data, any transmission of your Personal Data is done at your own risk and Amplitude cannot guarantee that such Personal Data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Data or information. If Amplitude learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Amplitude may post a notice on the Website or in Product if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
8. Your Choices About How We Use And Disclose Information We Collect From You
We strive to provide you with choices regarding your Personal Data and we understand that you have the right to access, correct, delete, object to and restrict our use of your Personal Data. We also understand that you have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data from us and to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data by us. Please note that the rights set forth in this Section 8, unless otherwise noted, apply globally to all Visitors and Customers, whether or not you are a California resident or a resident of the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your Personal Data:
You may choose not to provide Personal Data through our Website or when you register for the Product, in which case Amplitude may not be able to provide certain services to you or respond to your requests.
You can access, review, correct and/or change your Personal Data by logging into your account on the Website or Product and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an email at privacy@amplitude.com or ccpa@amplitude.com to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Data that you have provided to us. In some cases, we may not be able to delete your Personal Data except by also deleting your user account.
If you do not wish to have your email address or other contact information used by us to promote our own products or services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your Personal Data, by updating your user or subscription preferences in your account profile(s), or by sending us an email stating your request to privacy@amplitude.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may unsubscribe to receive future emails via the unsubscribe link in that email or adjust your user preferences in your account profile as noted above. The opt out specified above does not apply to information provided to us as a result of a purchase, product service experience or other transactions. You cannot unsubscribe from non-promotional and transactional communications.
You may also request a copy of your Personal Data that you have provided to us directly by sending an email to privacy@amplitude.com or ccpa@amplitude.com. We will provide you a copy of your Personal Data in a commonly used electronic form.
If we collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, where required by law, you can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing privacy@amplitude.com or ccpa@amplitude.com.
Depending on your country or state of residence, including if you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the sale of Personal Data, certain sharing of Personal Data with third party ad partners, and the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information. We do not sell your Personal Data or use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those permitted by the CCPA. We may share Personal Data with third party ad partners, such as through cookies or by providing lists of email addresses for potential customers so we can reach them across the web with relevant ads. If you wish to opt out of sharing, you may adjust your preferences in the Cookie Settings.
If you wish to opt out of this sharing of your Personal Data with cookies on this domain, please update your Cookie Settings.
Please note to exercise the rights set forth above we may ask you to: (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describe the request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a "Valid Request." We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 30 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
You may submit a Valid Request, or appeal our response to a valid request, by emailing us at privacy@amplitude.com or ccpa@amplitude.com with the appropriate information and detail.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the GDPR, CCPA or other applicable data privacy laws or regulations. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the GDPR, CCPA or other applicable data privacy laws or regulations.

14. Cookies
Amplitude uses cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Below we describe what cookies and web beacons are, why we use cookies and web beacons, the types of cookies and web beacons that we use, as well as what you can do in order to manage and delete cookies and web beacons.
What are cookies and web beacons?
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their websites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you return to our Website. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. The cookies can be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies are stored by a web browser and remain valid until a set expiration date. Session cookies only exist while your internet browser is open and are automatically deleted once you close your browser.
Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic files contained on pages of websites that permit companies to count users who have visited certain webpages on a website and are used for other related website statistics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
What does Amplitude
use cookies and web beacons for?
Amplitude uses a variety of cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies for different purposes. Specifically, Amplitude uses cookies and web beacons to enhance the experience of our visitors to our Website (for example, by remembering your preferences and letting you navigate between pages efficiently) and to better understand how the Website and Product are used. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor.
What types of cookies and web beacons are used by Amplitude?
Amplitude uses both first-party and third-party cookies and web beacons. First-party cookies and web beacons are cookies and web beacons that are served directly by Amplitude to your computer or mobile device.

There are four categories of cookies and web beacons used by Amplitude. Specifically, Amplitude uses essential, performance, functionality and advertising cookies and web beacons.
Essential cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are necessary for the operation of the Website and Product. These tracking technologies enable you to move around on the Website and use the Website’s features.

Functionality cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies allow us to remember how you are logged into our Website, when you logged in or out and the actions you have taken while you have been logged into the Website.
Advertising cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies are used by our third-party service providers to deliver advertising to you on other third-party websites as well as help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We also use these types of cookies to analyze Website visits and ad conversions from third-party websites.

Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (“

What & Why
We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
Account information.
We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).
Your Stuff.
Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (“
Your Stuff
”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your
profile information
that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.
Contacts.
You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you, and your Dropbox Team if you’re a Dropbox Team user, to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we’ll store those contacts on our servers.
Usage information.
We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders, and sending and receiving electronic signature requests and other transactions). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our
FAQ

Device information.
We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.

Cookies and other technologies.
We use technologies like
cookies and pixel tags
to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we’ll respond to that signal as outlined
here

Marketing.
We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don’t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the

Bases for processing your data.
We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs.

For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our
FAQ
.
For more details on the categories of personal information that are included in the information above, please see our
FAQ
.
With Whom
We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
Others working for and with Dropbox.
Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information that we’ve disclosed, please see our
FAQ
.
Other Dropbox Companies.
Dropbox shares infrastructure, systems, and technology with other Dropbox Companies to provide, improve, protect, and promote Dropbox Company Services. We process your information across the Dropbox Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For more information on Dropbox Companies, Dropbox Company Services, and how your data is used, please see our
FAQ
.
Other users.
Our Services are designed to help you collaborate with others. If you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, join a Dropbox Team, or collaborate with other Dropbox users, we may suggest you or your team as a potential collaborator to other users or teams. For example, if you interact with a person at a company, and that person frequently works with one of their coworkers, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator for that coworker. Collaborators and potential collaborators may see some of your basic information, like your name, Dropbox Team name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
Certain features let you make additional information available to others. For example, if you view a file or folder shared from DocSend or Dropbox analytics, we will share your identifying information such as name and email address, information on the device you used to view the content, and for how long you viewed content and what portion of the content you viewed with the owner of the file or folder.
Other applications.
You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party services––for example, via
Dropbox APIs
. By doing so, you’re enabling Dropbox and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Dropbox and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and promote their services. Please remember that third parties’ use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.
Team Admins.
If you are a user of a Dropbox Team, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox Team account. Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you aren’t a Dropbox Team user but interact with a Dropbox Team user (for example, by joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view information about you (such as your name, email address, and profile picture) and your interaction with the Dropbox Team user (such as your IP address). If you share Your Stuff with a Dropbox Team user, the administrator of the team account may have the ability to access and edit what you share.
Law & Order and the Public Interest.
We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users; (d) protect Dropbox’s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.
Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our Services or on your home computer’s hard drive. We’ll abide by the following
Government Request Principles
when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:
Be transparent
Fight blanket requests
Protect all users, and
Provide trusted services.
We publish a
Transparency Report
as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our
Government Request Principles
and
Transparency Report
for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.
How
Security.
We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.
User Controls.

Around the world.
To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world—including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.
Data Transfers.
When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, such as contracts with our customers and affiliates,
Standard Contractual Clauses
, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the European Commission's
adequacy decisions
about certain countries, as applicable.
Data Privacy Frameworks.
Dropbox complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Dropbox has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Principles of these Data Privacy Frameworks with respect to such data, but this does not include the DocSend or Formswift portions of the Services. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Principles shall govern. In accordance with the Principles, Dropbox shall remain liable for onward transfers if a processor processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can

Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Definitions
Definition of "User"
We divide App users into different categories depending on their access to our services as follows: Free User, Paying User, Enterprise, Partner, and Enterprise Member for privacy purposes.
User (Free)
Any natural person that uses the App free of charge.
User (Premium)
The natural person that subscribed to one of Spark Mail’s premium plans. User (Premium) can be an employee or other person who uses the App on behalf of or at the expense of an Organization or Enterprise.
Team
Two or more Users (Free or Premium) that use the Team-specific features (e.g., Team billing, Assignments/Delegation, Shared inboxes, etc.).
Organization
Legal entity that purchased a subscription to the Spark Mail Premium plan.
Enterprise
Legal entity that purchased a personalized subscription plan.
You own and control the personal data we collect about you. You can choose not to provide certain information or disable and prevent us from collecting, storing, and processing it by changing your account’s settings (e.g., by revoking consent or opt-out checkboxes), via our email address
dpo@sparkmailapp.com
or by any means of communication available for you. Please be aware that you may not be able to enjoy some of Spark’s features in such a case.
Controller Details
Any organization that collects and processes data can play different roles depending on particular data processing operation. For example, Spark plays different roles depending on the feature you use. In this Section, we explain how Spark meets the role requirements.
Controller
We are the Controller of the personal data for the Users (Free), Users (Premium), Teams, Organizations, and Enterprises (representatives of Organizations or Enterprises) from the moment of the User’s consent to the
Terms of Service
.
This means we determine the amount, purpose, and means of personal data processing when you use the App.
Processor
Under the applicable privacy protection rules, we can also act as the data processor depending on the particular data protection operation. This is the case where Spark provides a self-help tool, product, or feature and does not use personal data without the user’s instruction. For example, Spark does not use the email addresses of the email senders for Spark’s marketing activities, but only to enable the User to receive and send emails via Spark Service.
We are processing data on behalf of Organizations or Enterprises (based on the agreed instructions provided in the Data Processing Agreement; you may request a copy of our Data Processing Agreement at
dpo@sparkmailapp.com
).
Example
: Company A purchased 15 licenses for employees. The Сontroller of the employees’ data is Company A, while we are the processor concerning this processing activity (namely, where we provide them with Spark services at the expense of Company A). As a data processor, Spark does not use such data (e.g., email addresses of third parties) for our own purposes, for example, for cold calls marketing.
As a result, we are processors for all personal data of Users, employees, or contractors of the three categories: the Organization, the Enterprise, and the User (Free or Premium).
For more details about our role as a Controller and a personal data Processor, please contact us at
dpo@sparkmailapp.com
. Alternatively, you can also send us a letter.

Personal Data in Spark: What We Collect
This section explains our approach and practices for processing personal data at different features in the App.
Before we start
We process two categories of data: technical and personal data you provide to us. Some of it can be seen on the client-side (interface), and some are processed on the backend.
Client-Side
is the part of the App displayed or takes place on the users’ devices.
Backend
is an invisible crucial part of the App where algorithms operate on the variables and data points. In the majority of cases, it is crucial to process such data in order to provide our services to you. For example, we keep backend data taking into account organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of your data.
As defined, you may belong to one of the categories of Users:
Free User (Free)
Paying User (Premium)
Team
Organization
Enterprise
We collect your personal data according to this Privacy Policy when you use the App. When you use our Website, your personal data is processed in accordance with the Website’s
Privacy Policy
. Some of the data the App collects automatically, such as the country the App is used in: we get this data based on the IP address or from the App Store (we receive this information in a generalized form). Generally, all the data provided to us can either be linked to you or not (i.e., anonymized data).
We either create new personal data items or receive them from you. For example,
data we create and assign
will include userID, subscription expiration date, appToken, and
data we collect from you or the third parties on your behalf
would include payment history, requests, app usage data, account data, technical data.
Data Processed
We process some personal data for purely business purposes: to enable you to use our services, to notify you of our new products and features, to invite you to participate in our special programs and offers and beta testing programs, and to use parts of your data (usually pseudonymized) to monitor the trends and develop our product and business. We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service. We only collect the information necessary to provide you with our services.
Unless we specify a particular legal basis, we process your personal data based on the contract (our
Terms of Service
) (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: performance of contract).
Email address
: As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email. For this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App. Your email address is a unique identifier of you as a User within our system and allows us to secure your data. Your email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service, such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Beta Tester Agreement or core functionality of our App or Service. We may also use your email to sync your data with your third-party accounts (if you request us to do so in the App), or occasionally contact you for marketing purposes (it will be in our legitimate interests to do so). You will always have a chance to opt-out of such sync or any marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime. Please note that your email is safe with us, and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.
OAuth login or mail server credentials
: Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication. Without such access, our Product will not be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as “send later”, “sync between devices” and where allowed by Apple – “push notifications” we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.
Billing data
. We may need to process your personal data to ensure the smooth operation of your subscription plan and comply with the applicable laws. We do not have access to your sensitive payment data (as the payment processor will only collect your personal data to process the payment), but we may store your payment processor id, payment status, and information about your subscription terms (such as type and duration).
Identity of a team you join
: In order to make team collaboration within Spark possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message. Team identity is necessary to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team. Our system creates a record about the team only when you create one.
Email content while using Spark Services
: We may retain your email (at your request) when you use the “Send later” feature - until the email is sent, or create links to specific emails - until you stop sharing of the email. This information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you.
We also allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to have a secure space to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts and have private discussions. To provide you with enhanced text editing functions and real-time collaboration features for the team, we link shared email drafts to the teamID. Such draft is processed on our secure servers to make Services available to you.
We store the snapshot of the email draft (final text)as long as the team exists or until you delete the draft.
Please note that you are solely responsible for sharing your draft content (that may include personal data) with third parties, including team members.
Input and output:
When using Spark +AI, you can provide input (email text and prompt) for processing and receive generated output. We do not retain the content of your emails or prompts but only transmit them to the AI provider for processing. They do not use your data for model training and keep it no longer than 30 days. Read more about Spark +AI and its data processing practices in the ‘
AI Providers Data
’ section.
Email samples and writing style description:
When you activate ‘My Writing Style’, we process your recently sent emails to analyze their length and other criteria and select appropriate samples (‘samples’). Further, we pass the selected samples to the AI provider for analyzing your writing style and getting the textual description of it. Your emails are analysed for the samples and writing style description only once unless you use the ‘Rescan email samples’ option in the ‘Settings’, change the samples manually, or delete them and reactivate the feature.
The samples are stored in your account as settings of the feature. You can review the samples in the ‘Settings’ and manually replace them with other examples if you wish. We also store the samples and your writing style description in our backend.
To help you generate email with Spark +AI further, we will pass only your writing style description along with each request to the AI provider.
Spark will store the samples and your writing style description until you delete your account or until you delete all samples manually. Please note that when you delete all samples we automatically delete the writing style description.
Read more about ‘My writing style’ in the ‘
AI Providers Data
’ section.
+AI Meeting Notes and Summaries
. When you activate the ‘+AI Meeting Notes’ feature, we process several types of data. This includes the audio stream, which is transcribed, in certain cases the video stream to extract the audio, the conversation transcript generated by a third-party AI provider, and user information such as participant names, User Spark ID, Team identity, subscription type, email addresses, and display names. We also handle a summary of the transcript created by a third-party AI provider, event details from Spark Calendar (including the event name, participants, and timeframe), your notes and any modifications made to the original output, as well as analytics data about feature usage, such as feedback, transcript length, and usage statistics.
You can edit, copy, and share the transcript and/or summary using a link. These transcripts and summaries will remain in your Spark Account for as long as your account is active or until you choose to delete them.
Spark does not store the audio stream of the conversation, unless you choose to share one with us for troubleshooting purposes. The AI provider may retain the audio stream for up to thirty (30) days as part of its abuse and misuse monitoring processes. After this period, the audio is deleted unless a longer retention period is required by law.
Additionally, neither Spark nor the AI providers use the data processed through this feature for large language model (LLM) training.
For more details on how the ‘+AI Meeting Notes’ feature operates, please refer to the ‘
AI Providers Data
’ section.
IP address and settings
: The core functionality of our Product is based on an Internet connection, that is why our App and Service will not properly function without it. Your IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet, and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes. We also retain information about your settings so you may ensure the synchronization of your choices and experience between your devices.
APNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service)
: Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox. You’re free to enable or disable them during the initial App setup or later using your device’s system preferences.
App token assigned by us
: This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.
Device, App version, iOS version information
: We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.
Statistical information with regards to App usage
: In order to better understand general app usage patterns and improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product. Collecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates, and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts. You may read Amplitude’s
Privacy Policy
to learn more about their processing of personal data.
Recently accessed email messages, collaboration threads, and shared inboxes
: We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates, such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations, and shared inboxes. By collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark App and provide a better communication experience with your team.
Some of your email contacts
: Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people. To block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the “whitelist” of senders for push notifications. We’ll sync this “whitelist” of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications. If you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.
Read statuses data:
When you are a Teams user and enable the Read Statuses for external recipients, Spark processes the following data pertaining to the first opening of your emails to provide you with the relevant functionality: event of the first opening of your email, time and date of opening, and the corresponding recipients’ email addresses.
Pixel data and link clicks information
. We may use email and other marketing software to collect metrics on our marketing campaigns. Usually, pixels help their providers to collect technical data, such as the time when the image was loaded and the IP address, etc. For example, we may use the Braze service to see email opening rate, and then use this opening rate to enhance our emails and send our users a more helpful material or relevant offer in the future. Braze can also register that the link in the email was clicked on. You may disable pixels in your email service provider’s settings and avoid opening links, if you don’t want to participate in the collection of this statistics. In Spark, you should go to the “General” section of Settings page to disable loading the pixels.
Logs
: Some information about your use of the Spark Mail services can be stored either by us or by your device. When we collect this information on our servers, we do so to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App. The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on the device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information. This data is used only for technical purposes – that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App,to investigate possible security incidents, and to troubleshoot bugs and problems with the App reported by you. If you report an issue that prevents you from enjoying Spark, we may need the log data that is contained on your device to investigate the issue and troubleshoot. As we cannot obtain those logs without you sending them to us, we will rely on your consent.
Customer Support communication
: We process and store email or support chat communication, including attachments and information you voluntarily decide to share with us for troubleshooting purposes whenever you communicate with our support team.
To enhance your experience, we collect analytics on customer support requests (excluding any attachments) to understand the most frequent inquiries and identify areas for improvement within the App. This analysis is conducted internally within Spark using secure, in-house technologies, including pre-trained machine learning models. Rest assured, we do not use your personal data to test or train these models.
Request a feature
: When you contact us via the “Request a feature” form with your proposal for our product enhancement, we process your email address, type of device, your name (if you’re willing to share it), and any other additional information you may provide in the form. We process this data based on your consent. We automatically collect some technical information (platform, app version, date of installation, Spark ID and Braze ID) for a detailed analysis of your proposal. It is in our legitimate interest to do so. Also, we assign a unique identifier (token) for each form submission and collect the date and time of the submission.
We use Typeform to collect your request and Google Sheets to process it further. To know more of how your personal data is processed, you may read
Typeform’s Privacy Policy
and
Google’s Privacy Policy
.
We will use your data to prepare a proposal for our product development team and your email and name to contact you for more details (if needed) and notify you of the implemented features resulting from your request. We may keep and process this data for a few years but no longer than 6 years (as provided by the general statute of limitations in Ireland) and do not use your data for any other purposes except those mentioned in this section.
The “Request a feature” form is available in all Spark app versions except Spark Classic (Spark 2 on Mac).
Data from Microsoft Corporation
: When you download and use Spark Mail from the Microsoft Store, we may occasionally receive data, including telemetry or crash data, from Microsoft Corporation. This data is used only to improve the App and to test or troubleshoot quality issues, such as bugs, in accordance with the Microsoft Store App Developer Agreement.
Your Feedback
. We may publish your feedback, reviews and comments about your experience with our App ("

not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements, including retargeting, personalized, or interest-based advertising;
not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement (consent) to view specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating a bug or abuse, complying with applicable law, investigating an issue, and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized;
ensure that your employees, agents, contractors, and successors comply with this Google API Services: User Data Policy.
AI Providers Data
We use different AI models working locally on your device and third-party AI Providers (Azure OpenAI Service by Microsoft Corporation, Open AI by Open AI LLC, and Vertex AI by Google) to offer the Spark +AI feature, which is designed to help you create and edit emails with the help of machine learning algorithms. We may switch between the AI providers to provide a more secure and faster service, to run new versions of models, or for other commercially justifiable reasons. The switch between AI providers is manual, and we retain full control over it.
Please note that, in the event of a switch between AI Providers, the data processing rules and interaction protocols will remain the same as described below. We will not provide notification about such switches.
Applicability
. This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to our Premium Users of Spark 3 who use the Spark +AI feature or Users who get access to it during the Trial period. By default, Spark +AI is switched off: you must opt in to enable the Spark +AI feature.
Permissions
. We use the AI Providers' services and Spark +AI based on your consent. By using Spark +AI, you consent to the processing of your personal data by us as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of the AI Providers' services, you should not switch on the Spark +AI feature that incorporates it. If you decide to withdraw your consent, you must switch off the Spark +AI feature.

. Spark +AI helps you generate and edit email drafts. Spark +AI does not send emails on your behalf. You have full control over the generated content at all times, and you can review and edit it any time before sending.
Use of Spark +AI data
. Spark +AI is designed to protect your private data we obtain from you or about you. We do not store the contents of your emails and your requests for the Spark +AI feature. If you choose to use the Spark +AI feature, we will only transfer the textual context of your email to Microsoft to process your request and generate or edit email text based on that and additional context.
Model training
. We do not use your private data to train Microsoft, OpenAI or any other machine learning model when you use the Spark +AI feature. Any information, including personal data, that you furnish while using the Spark +AI feature will be shared with the AI Providers solely for the purpose of functioning of the Spark +AI feature. We do not permit the AI Providers to use your personal data for any other purpose except for debugging in the event of a failure and to monitor the potential misuse or abuse of their services. According to the AI Providers' documentation, they do not use customer data to train, retrain, or improve the base models.
Security of Spark +AI data
. Your email content and requests you make to Spark +AI are private and encrypted in accordance with our standard privacy and information security practices. We implement the latest commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect your personal data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in Spark, or third party services.

. You may provide input (prompt) to be processed by Spark +AI (“
Input
”), and receive output generated and returned by Spark +AI based on the Input (“
Output
”). When you use Spark +AI, Input and Output are your customer data (“
Customer Data
”). You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Customer Data.
‘My Writing Style’ feature
. This is an AI-powered feature based on profiling. Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data to assess specific aspects of a person. In this case, profiling does not result in any legal implications for you, nor does it significantly impact you in a similar manner. It analyzes a selection of your recently sent emails (referred to as ‘samples’) to learn and mimic your writing style. Subsequently, it applies your writing style and tone of voice to all new Spark +AI-generated email drafts.
By default, the feature is turned off. You can activate or deactivate it within the ‘Writing Assistant’ of the ‘Spark+ AI’ section in your account settings.
When you turn on the feature, we automatically select samples that meet the length and other criteria from your recently sent emails and pass such samples to the AI provider to get the description of your writing style. The AI Provider will not have access to your other emails. Further, the description of your style will be sent to the AI provider along with each request when you draft new emails with Spark +AI.
Read more about samples, their review, and deletion in the ‘Email samples’ subsection of ‘
Data Processed
.’
‘+AI Meeting Notes’ feature
. This tool provides AI-powered audio transcription and summarization, allowing you to generate meeting transcripts and AI-driven summaries. You can easily edit, copy, and share them via a link.
This feature is disabled by default. You can activate it by selecting “Start transcription” in the pop-up notification, or “Start Ad-Hoc Meeting” in the Calendar Agenda pop up, or from menus within the App. After you turn on this feature, please ensure that you inform the meeting participants that you are making a meeting transcription via Spark.
The feature captures an audio stream on your device with the help of the on-device AI model. Once the meeting ends or you finish the transcription, the audio stream is automatically sent to the third-party AI provider for obtaining a transcription, which is further summarized. The transcription and summary are saved in your Spark account.
Read more about transcripts and summary, and their deletion in the ‘Meeting Notes and Summaries’ subsection of ‘
Data Processed

Term of Storage and Retention Periods
The retention periods mentioned in this section have been calculated by taking into account the data minimization principle enshrined in the GDPR and applicable laws that affect the processing of personal data. We analyzed the processing of data on every step of data processing and calculated the shortest periods necessary to meet the purposes of data processing.
Please read this section together with the retention periods provided in the descriptions of the features.
In general, we store personal data for the following periods of time:
User (Free)
User (Premium) and representatives of Organizations and Enterprises
Teams
(Free and Premium)
Processing and retention
: duration of the contract (
Terms of Service
). If the User is inactive for 36 months, Spark will send two reminder emails notifying that the Account will be suspended (and personal data deleted) unless the User logs in.
The User will then have some time (“renewal period”) to log in to the Account and renew their Free Subscription. Otherwise, the Account will be deleted upon the expiry of the renewal period.
At the User’s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion
but not later than after 12 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.
Processing and retention
: duration of the contract (
Terms of Service
or personalized service contract for Enterprise(s)). If the charges cannot be withdrawn from the User, their Account then downgrades to the Free User subscription terms. The retention period is triggered on the day when the subscription plan changes, Spark will send two reminder emails after 36 months of inactivity, as described in the column on the left.
The retention and archiving periods are aligned with the service contract terms.
Processing and retention
: duration of the contract (the
Terms of Service
). If the last remaining Team member is inactive for 36 months (if they were using Free Subscription), Spark will send to the last remaining User the reminder that the Team data will be deleted unless the User logs in during the renewal period outlined in the reminder emails. Intra-Team communications that contain personal data will be retained as long as the Team owner remains an active Premium User.
At the User’s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion
but not later than after 36 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.
Consent
. We process the data based on your consent during the general term unless you withdraw it. After you withdraw your consent, it will take us up to 30 calendar days to erase your data.
Updates and marketing emails
. We may send you emails describing our new updates, features, discounts or opportunities. Given that the major updates are rare and Spark works closely with the users’ requests for new features, we may keep your data for up to a few years (but no longer than 6 years after the User account is deemed abandoned) to keep you informed of new opportunities Spark offers. You will always have the option to unsubscribe using the link at the end of the email or contact us via email at
dpo@sparkmailapp.com
to opt out from receiving such emails.
Customer Support communication
. We may retain the history of communication (including the contents of the communication, attached files, etc) between you and our Customer Support team for a few years but no longer than 6 years (as provided by the general statute of limitations in Ireland) to be able to respond to all your further questions and requests or inquiries of the entities that you authorize to act on your behalf, including those of legal nature. We apply necessary security measures to ensure that the communications and attachments are archived with access to them restricted.
Where you shared the audio stream from the +AI Meeting Notes and Summaries feature for troubleshooting purposes, we will delete it immediately once the issue is localized.
Your Feedback
. We will retain the Feedback which you provided to us directly for 5 years and the one which was collected from the third-party platform for 2 years, or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable), unless the law compels us to store it for longer in case of any procedures or actions. However, we reserve the right to delete your Feedback at any time at our sole discretion. You may also contact us at
support@sparkmailapp.com
to request that we refrain from or cease using your Feedback.
Deletion
. We will delete the data we process as a Controller under GDPR within one (1) month following the request. In case the request is complex or we have received a number of requests from the same individual, we may extend the time to respond to it by a further 2 months. We will inform you of any such prolongation within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay in response.
We store your personal data either until you delete the Account or after a certain period depending on the data type. When a retention period expires, we either delete your personal data or anonymize it so that it cannot be restored.

Data Sharing with Third Parties
We use your personal data based on the performance of the contract to provide services and communicate with the Users.
We may share personal data with our affiliates to the extent necessary to develop and/or support Spark. We share your personal data with our contractors to the extent necessary to provide services, technical and customer support. In addition, we can share your data on the following grounds: consent, compliance with the law (or legal obligation), and legitimate interest. Also, we have implemented organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during data transfer to third-party.
Details:
Consent
. We share your personal data based on your explicit consent.
Compliance with the law
. We will disclose your personal data to third parties to the extent that it is necessary:
to comply with a government request, court order, or applicable law;
to prevent unlawful use of our App or violation of the
Terms of Service
and our policies;
to protect against claims of third parties;
to help prevent or investigate fraud.
Legitimate interest or performance of the contract
. We may share your personal data with third parties based on a public offer for processing on our behalf, subject to technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. We may transfer your personal data to certain companies, consultants, and contractors hired to provide certain services on our behalf.
Independent data controllers
. We may sometimes receive your personal data from other, independent data controllers. We usually do so in one of two cases:
the third-party data controller shares your personal data with us in response to your request (for example, when you sync Spark Mail with your account in another app); and/or
an app store shares some data about on-market or in-app purchases, crash events, failed attempts to download or launch the app, or any other information that may affect your ability to buy, download, and use Spark Mail and its features on your device. For example, such independent data controllers can be Mac App Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Huawei AppGallery depending on your choice and device.
We process these personal data only to enable you to use Spark Mail or its particular features (for example, to fix the bugs that do not allow your device to launch the app). We will not use your data received from these independent controllers to build any profile about you, or use it for any marketing or advertising purposes. We anonymize or aggregate these data where possible (such as where there is no request from you to our tech support to help fix the bug) before processing.

Data Transfer Outside the European Economic Area
The personal data we collect is stored on servers in the USA. The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.
The European Commission has recognised the United States (commercial organisations participating in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework) as providing adequate protection. In particular, Google LLC and its wholly-owned US subsidiaries (unless explicitly excluded), have certified that they adhere to the DPF Principles.
There is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding Ukraine. Therefore, we have prepared a data processing agreement based on the standards of the Standard Contractual Clauses and carried out the legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage in third countries under the GDPR, such as Ukraine.
You can read detailed information on measures we take to protect your personal data
here
and, if signed, in our Data Processing Agreement with you. If you upload, send or create personal data of your clients or other data subjects via one of our Services, you may ask for a signed Data Processing Agreement by sending an email to
dpo@sparkmailapp.com
.
Security Measures
We regularly perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to ensure that we use an appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. We follow ISO 27001 Standard to put all security controls in place as a basis.
To be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), alarm systems, corporate VPN, written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).
Moreover, we systematically monitor our technologies’ state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations which are compliant with the GDPR requirements.
Here you can find information about the steps we mentioned above:
Trained team
Our team is competent in the matter of your personal data protection. Company regularly performs training in order to ensure that every team member has enough knowledge to keep your data safe and protect it in accordance with the best practices prescribed by European and U.S. laws on data protection.
HTTPS and encryption
We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. Your email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric and asymmetric encryption: private and public keys.
We currently use Google ("
Hosting providers
"). These Hosting providers have various international security certificates that ensure your data safety.
App Center. You can read more on the security measures via

.
Google. You can read more on the security measures via

.
Security measures (detailed explanation):
1. Physical access control: group access and alarm system
We secure access to the premises via ID readers, so only authorized persons have access to them. The ID cards can be blocked individually; access is also logged.
An alarm system is installed on the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorized persons. The alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.
2. System access control: individual access and password policy
Each employee has access to the systems/services only via their employee access. The access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.
Password policy
. We regulate access to our systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length. The SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.
We have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords. This guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.
Passwords must meet specific requirements. It must be at least:
12 characters long
1 letter in upper-case
1 letter in lower-case
1 number
1 special symbol
Our systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default. Only connection types defined by exception are accepted.
3. Data access control: monitoring and physical access policy.
All servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring. This includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.
Due to the proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.
Locking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and practiced.
4. Transfer control: contractual obligations and corporate VPN
Before transferring any data, we specify organizational and security requirements in Data Processing and Data Transfer Agreements (if applicable). These agreements are obligatory for every Enterprise and us as the Controller.
Furthermore, the handling of local data storage devices, e.g., USB sticks, is regulated via agreements.
Access to the systems outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.
5. Input control: general restriction
Our employees do not work directly at the database level but instead, use applications to access the data.
IT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.
6. Availability control: backups and division
We ensure the availability of data in several ways. For example, there is a regular backup of the entire system. This can be used if the other availability measures fail.
Critical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centers and controlled by a high-availability system.
Our workstations are also protected with the usual measures. For example, virus scanners are installed, and laptops are encrypted.
We would like to specify that we use MDM-solution to protect employee devices with security settings.
7. Separation control: limited access.
We use logically separate databases to prevent unauthorized persons from accidentally reading data with limited access.
Access to the data is also restricted because employees use services (applications) that control access.

Advertising to children

Operators can also be liable under DOPPA if, despite not directing their services or platforms to children, they have actual knowledge that children are accessing the services or platforms. In such an event, an operator cannot knowingly use, disclose, or compile that child’s personal information, nor can an operator allow another to do the same. An operator that provides a covered service or platform cannot advertise or market content inappropriate for children. In this regard, DOPPA provides an enumerated list of prohibited content, including alcohol, tobacco, firearms, fireworks, tanning equipment and facilities, lotteries and gambling, tattoos, drug paraphernalia, and pornography. You should note that an operator need not monitor the preceding if it uses an advertising service and ensures that it complies with DOPPA.

Privacy Policy
English
Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
for Apple or
shazam.com/privacy
for Shazam.
To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or by calling 1-800-275-2273.
For more information on exercising your rights, visit
support.apple.com/102283
.
At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to
collect only the personal data that we need
. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
When you create an Apple Account, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:
Account Information.
Your Apple Account and related account details, including email address, devices registered, account status, and age
Device Information.
Data from which your device could be identified, such as device serial number, or about your device, such as browser type
Contact Information
. Data such as name, email address, physical address, phone number, or other contact information
Payment Information. Data about your billing address and method of payment, such as bank details, credit, debit, or other payment card information
Transaction Information.
Data about purchases of Apple products and services or transactions facilitated by Apple, including purchases on Apple platforms
Fraud Prevention Information.
Data used to help identify and prevent fraud, including a device trust score
Usage Data.
Data about your activity on and use of our offerings, such as app launches within our services, including browsing history; search history; product interaction; crash data, performance and other diagnostic data; and other usage data
Location Information
. Precise location only to support services such as Find My or where you agree for region-specific services, and coarse location
Health Information.
Data relating to the health status of an individual, including data related to one’s physical or mental health or condition. Personal health data also includes data that can be used to make inferences about or detect the health status of an individual. If you participate in a study using an Apple Health Research Study app, the policy governing the privacy of your personal data is described in the
Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
.
Fitness Information.
Details relating to your fitness and exercise information where you choose to share them
Financial Information.
Details including salary, income, and assets information where collected, and information related to Apple-branded financial offerings
Government ID Data.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government-issued ID in limited circumstances, including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law
Other Information You Provide to Us.
Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels
You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.
Apple may receive personal data about you from other
individuals
, from businesses or third parties acting
at your direction
, from our
partners
who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other
lawful sources.
Individuals.
Apple may collect data about you from other individuals — for example, if that individual has sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.
At Your Direction.
You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases.
Apple Partners.
We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the
Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form
. For more information about Applebot, visit
support.apple.com/120320
.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Power Our Services.
Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.
Process Your Transactions.
To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it’s also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
child’s educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles children’s personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
“cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

Apple products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible,
your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world,
including Apple-affiliated companies, to perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live.
For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. and other Apple-affiliated companies on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For example, Imagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps and to support our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc. in California.
Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Apple’s international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by
Standard Contractual Clauses
. If you have questions or would like a copy of Apple’s Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Personal data collected by
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures.
Apple’s privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit
Global CBPR Forum
. To view our certifications, visit
CBPR System Compliance Directory
. For more information about the scope of our participation, or to submit a privacy inquiry through
BBB National Programs
, our Accountability Agent, visit:
Cross-Border Privacy Rules Program
Privacy Recognition for Processors Program
Personal data relating to individuals in the People’s Republic of China may be processed by Apple in countries outside of the People’s Republic of China, such as Apple Inc. in the United States or Apple Distribution International Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law. For the purposes of processing set out in this Privacy Policy, Apple may also transfer such personal data to third-party service providers, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of the People’s Republic of China. For more information, visit
China Mainland Privacy Disclosures
.
To make sure your personal data is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
If you have questions about Apple’s Privacy Policy or privacy practices including where a third-party service provider is acting on our behalf, or you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or call the
Apple Support number
for your country or region.
You can also ask us questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to help.
Apple takes your privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best to respond to your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or download request. In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other cases, we may require additional information or let you know that we need more time to respond.
Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.
You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with Apple’s response — refer your complaint to the applicable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.
When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

Investigations
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) is mandated to conduct investigations into complaints on the personal information handling practices of federal institutions subject to the
Privacy Act

Through the investigations, the OPC seeks to ensure organizations are complying with their privacy obligations under the law. When appropriate, the Privacy Commissioner may make recommendations to help prevent issues from recurring.
Under PIPEDA, the Commissioner may choose to make public certain findings if he deems them to be in the public interest. Under the
Privacy Act
, the Commissioner can only make his findings public through an annual or special report to Parliament.
