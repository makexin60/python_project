FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE DAA PROGRAM, PLEASE VISIT THE DAA WEBSITE. AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, COMPANY MAY USE OR TRANSFER DEVICE DATA THAT IT DIRECTLY COLLECTS OR THAT IT RECEIVES FROM COMPANY’S CUSTOMERS, WHO MAY USE COOKIES OR NON-COOKIE TECHNOLOGIES, TO ENABLE ADVERTISING THAT IS MORE TAILORED TO CONSUMERS’ INFERRED INTERESTS, PREFERENCES, AND LOCATIONS. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING. COMPANY MAY ALSO COLLECT, USE OR TRANSFER DEVICE DATA COLLECTED FROM ONE DEVICE FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING ON OTHER DEVICES THAT MAY BE LINKED TO THE DEVICE WHERE DATA WAS COLLECTED. THIS IS KNOWN AS CROSS-DEVICE LINKING.
COMPANY, AND SOME OF COMPANY’S CUSTOMERS, PROVIDE THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF THE COLLECTION AND USE OF MOBILE APP DATA ACROSS APPS OVER TIME ON A DEVICE, FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING PURPOSES, THROUGH THE DAA’S APPCHOICES TOOL. TO OPT OUT OF COMPANY’S COLLECTION, USE, AND TRANSFER OF SUCH APP USAGE DATA AND OF DEVICE GEOLOCATION DATA, FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING PURPOSES, CONSUMERS CAN DOWNLOAD APPCHOICES ONTO THE RELEVANT MOBILE DEVICE AND EXERCISE CHOICE THROUGH THE APP. WHEN SUCH CHOICE IS EXERCISED ON A DEVICE, COMPANY WILL ALSO STOP USING AND TRANSFERRING DEVICE DATA FROM THAT DEVICE FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING ON OTHER LINKED DEVICES, AND WILL STOP USING DEVICE DATA FROM OTHER LINKED DEVICES FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING ON THE DEVICE FROM WHICH CHOICE WAS EXERCISED. APPCHOICES IS AVAILABLE AT THE LINKS BELOW:

PLEASE NOTE THAT CONSUMERS WHO USE MORE THAN ONE MOBILE DEVICE SHOULD RENEW THEIR OPT-OUT CHOICES ON EACH DEVICE. CONSUMERS WHO OPT OUT FROM USE OF THEIR DEVICE DATA AS PART OF COMPANY’S SERVICES MAY CONTINUE TO RECEIVE INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING FROM OTHER COMPANIES.
THIS WILL OPT YOU OUT OF MANY –BUT NOT ALL- OF THE INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING ACTIVITIES IN WHICH COMPANY OR ITS THIRD PARTY PARTNERS ENGAGE. OPTING OUT VIA APPCHOICES WILL OPT THE USER OUT OF ALL COMPANY TARGETING SEGMENTS THAT ARE CREATED IMMEDIATELY AND ANY SUBSEQUENT SEGMENT DISTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE A LAG FOR THE USER’S ID TO BE REMOVED FROM PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TARGETING SEGMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY ACTIVE AT THE TIME WHEN THE OPT-OUT IS EXERCISED.
IF A USER WANTS TO END ALL TARGETING IMMEDIATELY, S/HE CAN TURN ON “LIMIT AD TRACKING” IN HIS/HER DEVICE SETTINGS. TO LIMIT AD TRACK ON AN APPLE DEVICE, SEE INSTRUCTIONS AT:

MOST OF THESE FEATURES, WHEN TURNED ON, SEND A SIGNAL OR PREFERENCE TO THE WEBSITE OR ONLINE SERVICE THAT A USER VISITS, INDICATING THAT THE USER DOES NOT WISH TO BE TRACKED. BECAUSE THERE IS NOT YET A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO INTERPRET DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNAL.   USERS MAY ALSO TURN ON “LIMIT AD TRACKING” WHICH WILL ZERO THEIR ADVERTISING IDS AS A MEANS OF OPTING OUT OF TRACKING.

JAMS Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Dispute Resolution
The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) were respectively developed in furtherance of transatlantic commerce by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, the UK Government, and the Swiss Federal Administration to provide U.S. organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union / European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU, UK, and Swiss law.
The effective date of the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 10, 2023, which is the date of entry into force of the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. DPF. The adequacy decision enables the transfer of EU personal data to participating organizations consistent with EU law.
Effective as of July 17, 2023, eligible organizations in the United States that wish to self-certify their compliance pursuant to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF may do so; however, personal data cannot be received from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF before the date that the adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF enter into force. The data bridge will enable the transfer of UK and Gibraltar personal data to participating organizations consistent with UK law.
The effective date of the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 17, 2023; however, personal data cannot be received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF until the date of entry into force of Switzerland’s recognition of adequacy for the Swiss-U.S. DPF. The recognition of adequacy will enable the transfer of Swiss personal data to participating organizations consistent with Swiss law.
The Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, which is administered by the International Trade Administration (ITA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce, enables eligible U.S.-based organizations to self-certify their compliance pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF. To participate in the DPF Program, a U.S.-based organization is required to self-certify to the ITA via the Department's DPF Program website (www.dataprivacyframework.gov) and publicly commit to comply with the DPF Principles. While the decision by an eligible U.S.-based organization to self-certify its compliance pursuant to and participate in the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program is voluntary, effective compliance upon self-certification is compulsory. Once such an organization self-certifies to the ITA and publicly declares its commitment to adhere to the DPF Principles that commitment is enforceable under U.S. law. All organizations interested in self-certifying their compliance pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF should review the requirements in their entirety. The Department’s DPF Program website provides useful information regarding the benefits and requirements of participation in the relevant parts of that program.
U.S.-based organizations that self-certify their compliance pursuant to the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program must, amongst other things, provide readily available recourse mechanisms available to investigate unresolved complaints, including a system of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by an independent third party. The independent recourse mechanisms must be in place prior to self-certification, and must be available at no cost to the individual. Although organizations self-certifying their compliance pursuant to the relevant part(s) of the DPF Program may utilize private sector developed dispute resolution programs for most categories of personal data covered under their self-certifications, those organizations covering human resources data (i.e., personal information about employees, past or present, collected in the context of the employment relationship) transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland must agree to cooperate and comply with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) respectively with regard to such data.
JAMS is available to serve as your organization’s designated ADR provider and to assist in resolving disputes brought under the DPF Principles, up to the point of any final arbitration invoked in accordance with the procedures and conditions set forth in the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. With a panel of over 400 neutrals around the world, JAMS specializes in resolving disputes of all sizes and levels of complexity and our neutrals have significant experience resolving issues involving privacy.
Mediation Rules
Mediations will be conducted pursuant to JAMS International Mediation Rules unless the parties have specified a different set of Rules or Procedures.
Download the JAMS International Mediation Rules
Fees
JAMS DOES NOT charge any fees for an organization to name it as an ADR provider. If an organization names JAMS as its ADR provider under the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we request that you notify JAMS
by registering here
.
When a consumer initiates a mediation or an arbitration against an organization (whether under JAMS Rules or another set of rules) all fees for the mediation, including the JAMS Case Management Fee, must be borne by the Organization. The fee arrangement is common to all DPF Dispute Resolution cases for the European Union / European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (and Gibralter), and Switzerland.
