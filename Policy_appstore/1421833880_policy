Company acquisition or business or asset sale

Analytics
: this App uses Google Analytics for Firebase, Google Firebase Crash Reporting and Amplitude Analytics services (i) provided by Google resp. Amplitude and (ii) providing insight into App usage and user engagement. Google and Amplitude will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating your use of the App and compiling reports on App activity for us. Some Firebase and Amplitude Analytics services process personal data, that will be provided to us by Google resp. Amplitude in an aggregated manner. For this reason, a data processing agreement is concluded with Google and Amplitude. However, the aggregated data received from Google and Amplitude does not represent personal data for us as we are not reasonably able to identify a specific user on the basis of this information, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior in general, for example by evaluating crash reports.
We may, in some cases, merge your personal data with the data of third parties. We do this, for example, to see your previous purchases.

7. International transfers
We (or our processors) may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third party (sub) processors located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (
EEA
) and to other Polaroid group companies in connection with the above purposes. For example, some Polaroid group companies or processors are domiciled in the United States, which leads to the disclosing of your personal data outside the EEA.
In such situations we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place that offer an adequate level of protection of your rights and freedoms as a data subject in accordance with the GDPR. We do this, for example, by concluding standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data approved by the European Commission, or by transferring your personal data only to third parties that are considered to guarantee an adequate level of protection according to the European Commission.
8. Data retention
We will retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is collected or processed and/or in accordance with legal obligations. After a retention period, we will delete or anonymize your personal data, unless we retain (part of) your personal data for another purpose. We will only do so if we have a legal basis to retain your personal data. We will ensure that personal data are only accessible for that other purpose.

User data and content submitted to Polaroid within the App via one of the App features will be removed within six months if the submitted content does not comply with the User Generated Content Policy of the Polaroid App or violates laws or regulations;
