We will stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes, as well as profiling.
Right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling
We do not use automated decision making means in our processing. We do not use your personal data to evaluate, analyse and predict any aspects concerning yourself, for example personal preferences, interests, behaviour, location or movements(“profiling”).
