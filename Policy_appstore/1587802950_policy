Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the 
                following statement will help you understand how our Collage 
                Maker app deals with the personally identifiable information 
                ('PII') you may occasionally provide to us via the Internet.
Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download 
                our applications. To be specific, we do not require the consumers 
                to get registered before downloading the application, nor do we 
                keep track of the consumers' visits to our application, we even 
                don't have a Server to store such PII.
Our MixCollage Collage Maker app will never collect and store any face data 
                when you use our application. And any PII can not be shared with 
                any third parties.
The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you personally 
                decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report. 
                The PII we may get from you in that situation is strictly limited to 
                your name, email address, and your survey response only.
In the above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used 
                for contacting you and improving our services. We will never use such 
                information (e.g. your name and email address) for any other purposes, 
                such as to further market our products or to disclose your personal 
                information to a third party for commercial gains.
It should be noted that whether or not to send us your feedback or bug 
                report is a completely voluntary initiative upon your own decision. 
                If you have a concern about your PII being misused, or if you want 
                further information about our privacy policy and what it means, 
                please feel free to email us in “Setting”- “Feedback”, we will 
                endeavor to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner.
In addition, you can revoke the MixCollage Collage Maker app’s access to your data 
                via the Google security settings page at

Highlights
We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That’s why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use
Meta Products
in the way that’s right for you.
In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of this Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We’ve also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.
It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can
update these settings
to shape your experience.
Read the full Policy below.
What Products does this Policy cover?
Learn more in Privacy Center about managing your privacy
What information do we collect?
Highlights
The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our
Products
. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you
even if you don't have an account
.
Here's the information we collect:
Your activity and information you provide
Friends, followers and other connections
App, browser and device information
Information from partners, vendors and other third parties
What if you don’t let us collect certain information?
Some information is required for our Products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.
Learn more
What if the information we collect doesn’t identify individuals?
In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it’s made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

Privacy Center
How do we use your information?
Highlights
We use
information we collect
to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products), along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.
For some of these purposes, we use information
across our Products
from the accounts you choose to add to your Accounts Center, and
across your devices
. The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use
manual review
to access and review your information.
To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.
Here are the ways we use your information:
To provide, personalize and improve our Products
We use information we have to provide and improve our
Products
. This includes personalizing features, content and
recommendations
, such as your
Facebook Feed
,
Instagram Feed
, Stories and ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products). We use
information with special protections
you choose to provide for these purposes, but not to show you ads.
