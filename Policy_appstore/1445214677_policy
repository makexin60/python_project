QUESTIONS
1. SCOPE
This Privacy Notice applies when Xplor acts as a controller (i.e. when Xplor decides how and why Personal Data is processed). It typically does not apply to situations where Xplor is acting as a service provider or processor (as described below). If you have questions regarding your relationship with Xplor, and whether or not this Privacy Notice applies to your interactions with us, please contact Xplor at
privacy@xplortechnologies.com
or as otherwise described in the
11. Questions
section of this Notice.
A.
Xplor as a Service Provider or Data Processor
Xplor Products and Services can be used by businesses that contract with us to use our Products and Services (“
Customers
”) and by consumers (“
Consumers
”). In most cases it is Xplor’s Customers, rather than Xplor itself, that make decisions about how the Customers’ employees (“
authorized users
”) and their customers or Consumers use our Products and Services. In most of those situations, Xplor is acting as a processor or service provider, and this Privacy Notice does not apply.
If you’re using an Xplor Product and Service in those situations, such as through your company, educational institution, gym, coach, or with your company email address, that entity is responsible for determining how your information is used.
This Privacy Notice does not typically apply to Personal Data that we process as a service provider or data processor on behalf of our Customers. If you are a Consumer of one of our Customers, you should read that organization’s privacy notice.
Questions about privacy practices can be directed to the Customer or to
privacy@xplortechnologies.com
.
B.
Xplor as a Controller
In other situations, Xplor acts as a “data controller” (the entity that decides how and why information is processed). This Privacy Notice applies to situations where Xplor is a data controller, such as when we process Personal Data collected online or offline by us, for example when:
Customers and Potential Customers:
receive communications from us or otherwise communicate with us;
use our Products and Services in their individual capacity under a contract with us;
perform billing using our Products and Services;
receive marketing communications from Xplor;
register for, attend or take part in Xplor events, webinars, programs, or contests;
participate in surveys, research or other similar data collection facilitated by us;
Consumers:
use our Products and Services to pay our Customers;
use our Products and Services in their individual/personal capacity;
Website Visitors:
visit our websites that display or link to this Privacy Notice;
visit our branded social media pages; or
register for, attend or take part in Xplor events, webinars, programs, or contests.
C.
Third Parties’ Products and Services
Our websites and Products and Services may also contain links to other websites, applications, platforms and services maintained by third parties. The information practices of these third parties, including the social media platforms that host our branded social media pages, are governed by their privacy notices, which you should review to better understand their privacy practices.

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., Australia, California, the European Union, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom), you may have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data:
the right of access to a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you;
the right to know what Personal Data is being collected, processed, sold or shared (as the term is defined by applicable law, i.e., the sharing of Personal Data through behavioral advertising cookies);
the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your Personal Data;
the right to opt-out of certain decisions about you being made by automated means, such as profiling to render significant decisions (although we do not envisage using automated decision making to make decisions that may be limited under applicable law);
where we have sought your consent, the right to withdraw your consent at any time;
the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes;
the right to object to or request that we restrict our use of your Personal Data;
the right to request that we provide a copy of your Personal Data in a portable format;
the right to request that we delete (e.g., “erase”) your Personal Data;
the right to prohibit the selling or sharing (as defined by applicable laws) of your Personal Data; and
the right to limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive Personal Data (although we do not process your sensitive Personal Data for reasons which may be limited).
We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
To make such requests, contact us at
yourdata@xplortechnologies.com
or as stated in the
11. Questions
section below. To make a request to delete, including a request to delete personal data related to your use of a mobile application, contact us at
yourdata@xplortechnologies.com
or as stated in the
11. Questions
section. If you are a Consumer and we are processing your Personal Data on behalf of our Customer as a service provider, you should direct your request to the appropriate Customer or to
yourdata@xplortechnologies.com
.
However, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to decline requests that are unreasonable, excessive, prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, if we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, or if we are otherwise permitted to decline such requests in accordance with applicable law. Depending on where you are located, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
In certain jurisdictions, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your Personal Data. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent with such permission.
Your verifiable request must: (i) provide sufficient information (e.g., name, address, phone number, and/or email address) that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Prior to complying with your request, we will need to verify your identity. Our verification procedure may differ depending on whether you have a registered account, the sensitivity of the Personal Data, and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized disclosure or deletion, as applicable. If you are a Consumer and we are processing Personal Data on behalf of our Customer as a data processor (for example, when processing data about your services with our Customer), you should direct your request to the appropriate Customer or to
yourdata@xplortechnologies.com
. Depending on where you are located you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns. We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing Personal Data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the Products and Services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.
8.
RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the Product and Services and fulfill the transactions and the Product and Services our Customers and Consumers have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different Personal Data types in the context of different Product and Services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the Personal Data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete Personal Data, and our legal or contractual obligations.
If you are a Consumer receiving services from a Customer, you may direct questions about the Customer’s retention of your Personal Data to them or to
privacy@xplortechnologies.com
or as stated in the
11. Questions
section below.

LOCATION OF PERSONAL DATA
The Personal Data we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Currently, we primarily use data centers in the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.
We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Notice is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Notice and applicable law wherever the data is located.
A.
Location of processing European Personal Data.
We transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries (including the USA), some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.

DATA SECURITY
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
