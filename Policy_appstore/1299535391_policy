Privacy - Is WatchChat safe to use?
WatchChat does NOT collect any personal data about your chats, phone numbers etc. Everything that WatchChat needs 
								in order to work happens locally on your iPhone and your Watch. There is NO
								third-party server involved for the conversations as your own iPhone is the entity that establishes 
								the connection and therefore is doing all the heavy lifting. I can NOT see your chats, 
								I have NO access to your data and there technically is NO way I could intercept your traffic.
								As this cannot be proven from my side you can check for yourself using a network monitor.
Syncing your quick replies with iCloud takes place within your personal iCloud storage
								that I do NOT have access to.
Whilst sending anonymized usage statistics (see below), the app does NOT come with third-party frameworks that are employed to access your personal data.
								As the app does NOT contain any ads, your app usage will not contribute to such services.
Anonymized usage statistics
In order to understand how to improve, WatchChat collects anonymized information about your device, namely the
								platform, systemVersion, appVersion, buildNumber, modelName, architecture, operatingSystem, locale and version for the code used to
								get this data. On first app launch, a random ID gets generated (impossible to trace back to your phone number, name or any other
								personal information) and the data above will be sent for analysis every time you launch the app.
In other words, your personal data always belongs to you :)
Should you have any more questions about the app, do not hesitate to contact me at HELP@XANTE
