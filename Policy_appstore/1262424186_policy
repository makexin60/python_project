(A)
AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.
YOUR ECHELON SUBSCRIPTION (INCLUDING ANY FITPASS SUBSCRIPTION) AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS AND WILL CONTINUE UNTIL CANCELLED. YOU WILL BE CHARGED DIRECTLY BY ECHELON OR THROUGH YOUR ITUNES OR GOOGLE PLAY STORE ACCOUNT IF YOU MADE YOUR PURCHASE THROUGH ITUNES OR THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE, RESPECTIVELY. SEE OUR MEMBERSHIP PAGE FOR PRICING INFORMATION. ANY UNUSED PORTION OF ANY FREE TRIAL WILL BE FORFEITED WHEN THE TRIAL ENDS AND SUBSCRIPTION IS PURCHASED.
FOR ANNUAL OR BI-ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS, WE WILL SEND YOU A NOTICE OF RENEWAL.
(B)
PRICES AND PAYMENT TERMS.
UNLESS YOU HAVE SELECTED A FREE VERSION OF A SERVICE, THE SERVICES ARE PAID, AUTO-RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE STATED SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UPON COMPLETION OF YOUR REGISTRATION AND SUBMISSION OF YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION UNLESS YOUR MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES A FREE TRIAL PERIOD.
IF YOU ACCEPTED AN OFFER WITH A FREE TRIAL FOR ACCESS TO THE SITE OR THE APP, YOUR MEMBERSHIP BEGINS WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE FREE TRIAL SIGN-UP PROCESS (I.E., WHEN WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL AND PAYMENT INFORMATION). AT THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL, YOU WILL BEGIN TO BE BILLED AUTOMATICALLY ACCORDING TO THE MEMBERSHIP TERM YOU HAVE SELECTED. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR FREE TRIAL MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD, YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED.
IF YOU HAVE SELECTED A MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP, WE WILL
BILL YOU AUTOMATICALLY EACH MONTH (ABOUT EVERY 30 DAYS) UNTIL YOU CANCEL. IF YOU HAVE SELECTED AN ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP, WE WILL BILL YOU AUTOMATICALLY EVERY 365 DAYS UNTIL YOU CANCEL. IF YOU HAVE SELECTED A TWO-YEAR MEMBERSHIP, WE WILL BILL YOU AUTOMATICALLY EVERY 730 DAYS UNTIL YOU CANCEL. ONCE WE BEGIN TO BILL YOU, CANCELLATIONS TAKE EFFECT STARTING AT THE END OF YOUR CURRENT BILLING PERIOD, MEANING THERE ARE NO PARTIAL MONTH REFUNDS OR CREDITS.
YOU ARE AGREEING THAT UPON EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION OR FREE TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR SUCCESSIVE PERIODS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. YOU AGREE TO AUTOMATIC (RECURRING) BILLING AND AGREE TO PAY THE CHARGES MADE TO YOUR ACCOUNT IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. WE WILL PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTIONS USING THE SAME BILLING CYCLE AS YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION. YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND THE RECURRING BILLING OF YOUR ACCOUNT WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL CANCELLED BY YOU. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION OR ACCESS THE SERVICES, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR IT IS OTHERWISE TERMINATED.
(C) PRICE AND OTHER CHANGES.
SUBSCRIPTION FEES MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
PRICE CHANGES TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SHALL APPLY AFTER WE PROVIDE REASONABLE ADVANCE NOTICE TO YOU. PRICE DECREASES TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION MAY OCCUR UPON NOTICE.
ANY OTHER MATERIAL CHANGES TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SHALL APPLY AFTER WE PROVIDE REASONABLE ADVANCE NOTICE TO YOU.
(D) CANCELLATION.

THERE ARE NO REFUNDS ON ECHELON SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR BILLING PERIODS THAT HAVE ALREADY LAPSED. IF YOU HAVE AN ANNUAL OR TWO-YEAR MEMBERSHIP, YOUR CANCELLATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT YOUR NEXT SCHEDULED AUTO-RENEWAL.

EACH ADD-ON SERVICE IS A SEPARATE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL FEE THAT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS JUST LIKE YOUR REGULAR SUBSCRIPTION.

(i)
All active Premier Members receive an additional four (4) years of total warranty coverage in addition to the one (1) year limited warranty on equipment, for a total of five (5) years of total coverage.
You must be and continue to be an active Premier Member to receive this benefit; past Premier Members are not eligible.
The warranty period for Echelon Premier Warranty begins as of the date of purchase of the equipment; provided, however, that if a member decides to enroll in and maintain an Annual Premier Membership after the purchase of equipment, the member will receive the Premier Warranty beginning as of the purchase of Premier Warranty, and ending five (5) years from the original purchase of equipment.
For example, if a member purchase a Premier Warranty two (2) years after purchasing the Product, the member would have extended coverage under the Premier Warranty for an additional three (3) years.
The new Premier Warranty program begins immediately, and includes all existing Premier Members, who will receive the Premier Warranty for five (5) years from the date of equipment purchase. The Premier Warranty does not extend the limited warranty period on the treadmill motors or frames.
The Premier Warranty does not cover other membership tiers, such as CHOICE Membership.
(ii)
For active Premier Members who previously purchased an extended warranty, the Warranty Period shall be extended an additional four (4) years.
For example, if an active Premier Member purchased a two (2) year extended warranty at the time of purchase, the member would receive seven (7) years of total coverage: one (1) year base warranty coverage + two (2) year extended warranty coverage + four (4) year Premier Warranty coverage.
(iii)
Will Echelon still offer extended warranty coverage?
Yes, for customers who chose not to purchase a membership, or who purchase a membership other than Premier Membership, we will still offer extended warranty options.
(f)
What Are Your Remedies Under This Warranty?
With respect to any defective Product during the Warranty Period, we will,
in our sole discretion
, either: (i) repair or replace such Product (or the defective part) free of charge, or (ii) refund the purchase price of such Product. We will also pay for shipping and handling fees during the first 12 months to return the repaired or replacement product to you if we elect to repair or replace the defective Product. After month 12, if a replacement product is required, we will charge a fee for shipment of the new or refurbished replacement product to your location. For 2023 the replacement product shipping fee is $99. This replacement product shipping fee does not apply to items under the “frame” warranty.
With respect to any defective Service during the Warranty Period, we will, in our sole discretion, either: (i) repair or re-perform the defective Service free of charge, or (ii) refund the price paid by you for such Service.
(g) How Do You Obtain Warranty Service?
To obtain warranty service, you must call 833-YES-BIKE or email our Customer Service Department at cs@echelonfit.com during the Warranty Period, and one of our Customer Service Specialists will be happy to assist you to obtain an RMA number. No warranty service will be provided without an RMA number.
