Privacy Policy
Hemisphere Games, Inc. (“we” or “Hemisphere”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. By using the service offered through the Osmos mobile game (the “Osmos App”), you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We provide this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Osmos App.
Hemisphere does not collect, transmit, share, or store any user information through the Osmos App. No Personally Identifiable Information entered into the Osmos App will be collected or transmitted anywhere.
Osmos accesses a player’s Game Center account for the purposes of updating achievements, and for online multiplayer matchmaking. Players may also post their achievements to Twitter or Facebook from within Osmos, but only when initiated and confirmed by the user.
Osmos may access a player’s microphone and/or camera if they choose to record or broadcast video from within Osmos with those options enabled.
Osmos synchronizes players’ progress to their iCloud account so it can be shared across devices. This can be disabled within Osmos or in your device’s iCloud settings.

Hemisphere Games Privacy Policy
We know that you care how information about you is used and shared. So does the GDPR! :)
By purchasing and playing our various games (So far, Osmos and Karmaka) and using our website you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of your rights and help you make informed decisions about using our services.
Here’s the exectuve TL;DR summary:
What personal data does Hemisphere Games gather? In our games, none. On our website, the little we need to deliver your games.
What do we do with that data? Only what you’d expect us to in order to provide you with service.
Who do we share that data with? Only physical fulfillment partners for Karmaka.
Will we delete your personal data on request? Yes!
In the interest of full transparency, here’s an exhaustive list of all our user data, and how we use it, broken down by game and website. Feel free to comment and/or ask us to remove your associated data of any kind.
Osmos
iOS version: We actually have a separate privacy policy for this you can find
here
.
Android version: This privacy policy can be found
here
.
Windows/Mac/Linux versions: If you purchased Osmos from our website, we have your name, email address, zip code, and a few other bits of info. (
Not
your billing info.) We use that to send you an email with your download link, and to allow you to download the game you purchased. You can ask us to delete that record if you like, but then we’ll no longer have a record of your purchase, and you won’t be able to download the game anymore. If you purchased the game from a portal such as Steam, Humble, or the Mac App Store, they have your customer info, etc. Reviews you post there are publicly visible. Steam has communities with some visible aspects as well, and we synchronize your Osmos achievements with their achievement system.
Karmaka
If you backed our Kickstarter for Karmaka, we have your name, email, and physical address so we were able to ship you a copy of the game. We shared that info with our fulfillment partners (Blackbox and SFC) so they could mail you your game. Kickstarter has that info as well of course.
If you purchased Karmaka from our website, Blackbox has your name, email, and physical address so they could mail you your game.
Website
We have a phpBB
forum
. You can register an account on that forum which allows you to post to it. Beyond that we don’t even look at that user data unless it’s to delete a user’s account if they’re a spammer. (Don’t be a spammer.) You can always delete your account.
Likewise, we have this WordPress blog that you can comment on by creating a WordPress account. Similar story as the forum.
We have a Mailchimp mailing list for Karmaka (infrequently used). Feel free to
unsubscribe
.
