Playsaurus Privacy Policy

As of October 5, 2023:

Playsaurus is a relatively small game development studio. As such, we do not
collect too much information from our players, so our privacy policy is pretty
simple. As we develop more games, our privacy policy may need to be updated to
reflect new information that we collect from our players.

When you visit our websites, or play our web and/or PC games, we use
third-party analytics tools (e.g. Google Analytics) so that we can see
aggregate statistics, such as the total number of players per day.

If you play our mobile games, whether on Android or iOS, we will offer to
display ads to you. To provide ads, Google (using AAID) or Apple (using IDFA)
provides us with your unique advertising identifier, which is used to
anonymously identify you to advertising partners. The advertising partners use
this identifier to track your behavior in order to decide which ads to show
you. If you have read this far into this document, then you probably care
enough to know that you can (should?) opt out of these tracking systems, which
will prevent advertisers from tracking your behavior and personalizing ads on
your phone. https://pippio.com/optout/ and

In some games we may ask survey questions. The answers to these questions
are saved sometimes in connection with other information such as game user id, IP address, and/or email, along with
additional information regarding game progress (such as what zone you've reached, or other similar game state). We
use these answers to help us better understand our audience for marketing efforts and in some limited cases for
retargetting/retention ads/offers.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years
of age.
