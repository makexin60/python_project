In cases where we use external solutions, security is guaranteed by data processing contracts in which we require the subcontractor to use equivalent secure solutions, thus guaranteeing Swiss Sport Integrity’s control over personal data. We treat data as strictly confidential, do not sell it and do not share it with unauthorized third parties. Your data will not be kept longer than is necessary to achieve legitimate purpose.
Data retention and deletion
We take administrative, technical, physical, contractual and other measures to protect personal data in our custody and control against theft, loss and unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure. This includes restricting access to your data, on a need-to-know basis, to authorized employees and service providers who require access to perform their designated functions.
Personal data collected is used for the purposes for which it was collected and is retained for a specified period, depending on the type of information (see purposes of processing under «What personal data is processed?»). Personal data is deleted when Swiss Sport Integrity no longer needs it, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Personal data collected under other agreements are used for the purposes specified in the agreement and are retained as well as deleted as indicated therein and generally when Swiss Sport Integrity no longer needs them.
In addition, we retain your data for as long as required by applicable law or to defend against legal claims.
Activities relating to anti-doping:
Data retention and deletion is carried out in accordance with
ISPPPI
, in particular Appendix A..
Activities relating to ethics in sport:
In principle, data is kept for 10 years after the case is closed, when it is then deleted.

ADEL Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 6, 2021
The Anti-Doping Education and Learning platform (
ADEL
), created and managed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (
WADA
), offers access to topics related to clean sport and anti-doping. It offers courses for athletes, coaches, doctors, anti-doping professionals and anyone interested in learning more about anti-doping and protecting the values of clean sport.
This privacy policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, shared and otherwise managed in connection with your use of ADEL. This includes the ADEL mobile application, which allows you to access ADEL learning resources ‘on the go’ and offline.
If we make material changes to this policy that impact how we process your personal information, we will ask you to review its terms and re-accept them prior to logging in to your account.
Important Notice about ADEL’s Age Policy:
If you are under 16, you will need your parent or guardian’s permission to use ADEL. You will be asked to provide your parent or guardian’s email address when you sign up, and your parent/guardian will receive a request to confirm your registration. Do not use ADEL if you are under 16 and do not have your parent or guardian’s permission to do so.

Why we collect and use personal information
Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, for example, your name, age and email address. Here are the purposes for which we collect and use personal information:
To create and manage your account
Creating an account
To access courses on ADEL, you will be asked to create an account and to provide the following information:
a username and password you select. Please ensure that you carefully select your username as once you set it; you can only change it upon request to WADA;
your age range;
your first name, last name and email address (or your parent or guardian’s email address if you are under 16 years old);
your language; and
your role (such as an athlete, ADO employee, parent, coach, student, etc.).
Depending on your role, we may also ask you for some or all of the following information, as applicable:
your country (where you live or the country you compete for);
gender;
your sport, sport level, and sport discipline; and
the anti-doping organization you work for and your primary role at this organization; and
once registered, you may choose to upload a photo to your account.
To connect you with anti-doping organizations
Power Users
Depending on the role, country, sport, and sport level selected in your account profile, your ADEL account may be linked with another organization that has a special account called a “Power User” account with certain administrative rights in ADEL. Power Users can enroll you in learning activities and monitor your anti-doping education progress. Power Users may also ask WADA to create an account for you, in which case you would receive an email notification to confirm and complete your registration.
The general rules to link an account to a Power User are summarized here and you can access complete details by reviewing the
Use by Power User
section below and our
Power User Policy
.
National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) are the Power User for athletes, coaches, athlete agents, athlete parents, anti-doping professionals, sport scientists working in high performance sport, teachers and gym instructors tied to the country for which the NADO is responsible.
International Federations (IFs) are the Power User for anti-doping professionals, athletes on a performance pathway, and the agents, coaches, and parents of athletes on a performance pathway, in each case that are tied to the sport for which the IF is responsible.
Major Event Organizations (MEOs) can be linked to users who enroll in a learning activity tied to an event the MEO is responsible for, but only with respect to that specific learning activity and for a limited time.
Other types of organizations can also become Power Users upon request to WADA if they have been delegated responsibility for anti-doping education by a NADO, IF or MEO, or if they have otherwise demonstrated a need to use ADEL to deliver anti-doping education to their stakeholders.
To provide you with learning resources
Enrolling in a learning activity
Learning activities include webinars, live training, e-learning courses and education programs. When you participate in learning activities, we collect information about what you are enrolled in, first and last access date, final score, and time in session.
We use this information to provide you with completion certificates when you successfully complete a learning activity, and to allow you and your Power User(s) to monitor your anti-doping education progress.
You will be automatically enrolled in activities that are relevant for the role selected in your account profile, and your Power User(s) can also enroll you in additional activities. You can also choose to enroll in any learning activity through the ‘
ADEL Academy’
on your dashboard. Activities you are enrolled in will appear under your Education Program in your ADEL dashboard.
Gamification
ADEL includes gamification features to motivate you and other ADEL users in your anti-doping education pathway. When you complete learning activities on ADEL, you collect points and will be awarded badges based on those points. On your ADEL dashboard, you will see a leaderboard of ADEL users in the same category as you (for example, all international-level athletes will see the same leaderboard).
Your username will be visible to other ADEL users in the leaderboard for your user category. You may therefore wish to choose an anonymous username when you register on ADEL.
Comments and Feedback
You will be able to rate and provide comments on ADEL learning activities. Comments are public so that other users can benefit from your question or feedback. Your username will be displayed when you make a comment. You can also send us your feedback privately using the ADEL Helpdesk if you wish. WADA reserves the right to remove or delete comments, and/or users should they be inappropriate for ADEL.
Social Media
You can share your ADEL learning activities on social media platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google+. The operators of these platforms collect personal information about users for their own purposes, and you should consult their privacy policies for more details.
To operate, deliver, and improve ADEL
Notifications
We will send important notices about your ADEL account and learning activities to your email, such as when we need to verify your email, to confirm your enrollment in a course, or to remind you of an upcoming webinar. You can also find these notifications and more by navigating to the notifications tab of your ADEL account.
User support
You can send us a request or question using the ‘
ADEL Helpdesk’
. We will ask you to identify and describe your request and provide your email address so that we can respond to you. We may also ask you to confirm your title and the ADO you are writing on behalf of, if relevant to your support request.
Operating ADEL
ADEL needs to collect certain technical data automatically to function. This includes data about the device and/or browser you use to access ADEL as well as the actions you take on the platform (for example, the IP address and type of device or browser used, the date and time of visit, crash reports, time spent, page speeds/resolution, and pages viewed and requested). We use this information to operate ADEL and troubleshoot user issues.
Improving ADEL
Aggregated technical data also helps us measure and improve the performance of ADEL. We plan to start using aggregated technical data for this purpose very soon, but we will ask you to consent to the use of cookies to allow us to do this separately. See our
Cookie policy
for more information on the collection of technical data using cookies, and what we do with this data.
To develop and improve anti-doping education
As part of WADA’s role in the protection of clean sport under the World Anti-Doping Code, we may aggregate information from ADEL to create statistics about anti-doping education and to conduct research about attitudes toward doping. If we provide this information to third-party researchers, we will ensure it is aggregated and anonymized and that it is not associated with any individual user.
We process your personal information with your consent, as needed to provide you with the ADEL platform and its features, or as needed to foster, develop and promote anti-doping education in accordance with our global mandate and interests as leader in the protection of clean sport.
When and where we share personal information
WADA and its service providers:
ADEL is powered by third-party software provided by Docebo. Docebo hosts ADEL in a datacenter located in Canada. The ‘
ADEL Helpdesk’
is powered by third-party software provided by Zendesk and is hosted in Germany.  Only a few authorized WADA staff located at WADA’s headquarters in Montreal (Canada) have access to ADEL as administrators to operate and manage the platform. WADA staff located in its
Regional Offices
may have access to information about the education of users associated with a country falling within their respective region.
We ensure service providers only have access to personal information where necessary for their designated functions. Where possible, we work with service providers who are able keep any personal information processed on our behalf in Canada or another jurisdiction recognized for providing strong levels of data protection. Where our service providers or a Regional Office handle personal information and are not based in Canada or another jurisdiction deemed to provide an adequate level of protection (for example, the US) we ensure they are subject to appropriate contractual or other safeguards and are responsible for ensuring similar controls are in place with any of their authorized subcontractors. Canadian (federal), Swiss, Japanese and Uruguayan data protection and privacy laws have been deemed to provide adequate protection by a number of regional and national data protection agencies, as well as the European Commission.
Power Users:
If your ADEL account is linked to a Power User (see
Use by Power Users
) this organization will have access to your account information. This organization is responsible for notifying you if it uses ADEL and has access to your ADEL information so that you may understand any additional locations from which your ADEL information will be accessed. Power Users are subject to a contractual agreement that includes requirements to comply with the
International Standard for the Protection of Privacy and Personal Information
(or "ISPPPI", as amended, updated and/or replaced from time to time) and applicable privacy and data protection laws. See
Use by Power Users
for more details.
Legal and compliance:
WADA may disclose your information to governmental and other authorities where required by law or compulsory legal process and to other organizations in the case of investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law; or to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. Service providers and Power Users are subject to the laws of the countries in which they operate and could be compelled by legal process to disclose personal information to courts, law enforcement or other public authorities.
Safeguards
WADA adopts measures, including administrative, technical, physical and contractual measures, to protect personal information in our custody and control against theft, loss and unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure.
We restrict access to your personal information on a need-to-know basis to employees and authorized service providers who require access to fulfill their designated functions. We have developed a
Power User Policy
to ensure the identity of Power Users is validated before they are granted administrative rights and to limit their access to specific user categories and to the sport or country they are responsible for. Organizations that are granted a Power User account sign an agreement with WADA that includes obligations to protect personal information and only use it for anti-doping education purposes.
Docebo, the third-party software that powers ADEL, maintains an information security management system that is compliant with a number of industry standards, including ISO 27001. You can view more information about Docebo’s information security program
here
.
Retention
We will retain your personal information as long as you have an ADEL account. To delete your ADEL account, please submit a request via the
‘
ADEL Helpdesk’
. We will delete your account and any associated personal information as soon as reasonable possible and not more than 30 days after we receive your request, unless required to retain it due to legal requirements or to defend ourselves against legal claims.
If you do not log in to your account for an extended period, we may consider your account inactive and will delete it and any associated personal information. Where possible, we will send you a notice before deleting your inactive account.
Your Rights and Choices
You can update your ADEL profile information at any time by logging in to your account and selecting
“My profile”
on your ADEL dashboard. If you change your role, sport, or sport level, this may impact which Power Users your account is linked to. You can access the
full list of organizations
with a Power User account or request a list of specific Power Users linked to your account at any time via the
‘ADEL Helpdesk’
.
You can delete your account by submitting a request via the ‘
ADEL Helpdesk
.
’
You may also have additional rights under applicable laws or under the ISPPPI, subject to applicable exemptions, including rights to access, correct and/or delete your information, the right to oppose the processing of your information, and the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority or to obtain other remedies with respect to unlawful processing of your information. If you have questions or complaints about how we handle personal information, please ‘
Contact Us
’
.
Organizations responsible for Power User accounts may choose to make the use of ADEL to complete anti-doping education a mandatory element of their anti-doping program, or a pre-requisite to participating in a sporting event. If this is the case, refusing to do so may prevent you from being able to compete in sporting events or could have an impact on anti-doping rule violation proceedings against you. These decisions are made and managed by the relevant organization in accordance with its anti-doping rules, and you should contact the relevant organization directly if you have questions.
Cookies and SDKs
We use cookies on ADEL to operate the platform. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the user’s computer or mobile device. In order to function, these cookies collect certain technical data about this device, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, device type, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform. In the ADEL mobile app, we use Software Development Kits (SDKs) for the same functions as cookies. See more in our ‘
Cookie Policy

Use by Power Users
Who are they?
Power Users are typically an ADEL user within an Anti-doping Organizations or
ADOs
(like International Federations (IFs), National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) or Major Event Organizations (MEOs)). On a case-by-case basis, we may allow other types of sporting organizations to have a Power User account (such as regional anti-doping organizations, continental sport associations or other organizations to whom an ADO has delegated responsibility for anti-doping education or that have a need to deliver anti-doping education).
Why are power users an important feature of ADEL?
ADOs are required to implement and conduct anti-doping education programs under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code) and International Standard for Education. To help foster, promote, and enhance anti-doping education programs around the world, ADEL provides ADOs and these other organizations with a zero-cost learning management system to implement their education programs. Not all ADOs choose to become Power Users and use ADEL in this way.
If an organization wishes to use ADEL as a Power User, WADA will grant certain administrative rights to a user within the organization that will enable it to deliver and monitor learning activities of users falling within its anti-doping education program. Power Users are responsible for notifying you if they use ADEL in this way, and of providing you with details about how they handle your information. You can access the
full list of organizations with a Power User account
or request a list of specific Power Users linked to your account at any time via the
‘ADEL Helpdesk’
.
How will my account be linked to a Power User account?
Not all ADEL users will be linked to a Power User accounts. Linking will depend on the role, country, sport, and sport level selected in your ADEL account profile.
NADOs and IFs are the most common type of organizations with Power User accounts. We summarized the general rules that determine how your account could be linked to a Power User above. Here is an example to help you understand:
If you are an international judo player in Germany, the Power User for the German NADO will be linked to your account. The Power User for the International Judo Federation will also be linked to your account. This is because both the NADO and the IF have a responsibility to provide anti-doping education to you, and have chosen to use ADEL as a learning management system within their anti-doping education program.
You can find complete details about the Power User linking rules in the
Power User Policy
.
What powers do they have?
If a Power User is linked to your account, the user will be able to view your account profile information (like your name, email address, gender, and sport). The user will be able to enroll you to learning activities they would like you to participate in. For each learning activity you take part in, the user can also see information about the times and dates you subscribed to, last accessed and/or completed the activity, along with your progress and scores, as applicable.
Power Users that are users within an MEO have more limited rights. They would only be able to monitor your interaction with a learning activity that is linked to the event they are responsible for.
For example: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for the Olympic Games. The Power User for the IOC will be able to monitor the completion of the ADEL for Tokyo 2020 course.
You can find complete details about Power User rights in the
Power User Policy
.
Where an administrative account is not an appropriate solution for a specific organization and cannot be granted (e.g., where this would result in access rights that are broader than necessary), WADA may, upon request, export certain course completion information for a subset of users associated with that organization.

Cookies Policy

A summary of the cookies used by the Platform can be found in the cookie table at the end of this Cookie Policy.

Global DRO and our analytics vendors may tie the information gathered by these means to the identity of users.
Cookies are small text files placed on a computer or device while browsing the Internet. Cookies are used to collect, store and share bits of information about user activities. Global DRO uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies are used to identify a particular visit to Global DRO’s Platform. These cookies expire after a short time or when the user closes their web browser after using the Platform. Global DRO uses these cookies to allow a user who has accepted the Platform’s terms and conditions to conduct searches until the user ends the session (closes their web browser window), and to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

register the preferred language of a user,
generate statistics on how a user utilizes the Platform, and

However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, so we do not take any action in response to this signal. Global DRO does not have a mechanism in place to respond to DNT signals. Instead, in addition to publicly available external tools, we offer you the choices described in this Cookie Policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.
