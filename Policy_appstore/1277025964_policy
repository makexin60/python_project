Privacy Policy
A privacy policy is often a big, intimidating block of text that is supposed to reassure you but you don't read.
We have written ours to be as clear and accessible as possible, so that you understand exactly how your personal data is used by Alan.
Enjoy your reading.

Personal data
How is my data protected?
Why a privacy policy?
In the course of its activity as a health insurer and as a health management services provider, Alan is required to process sensitive personal data. We attach the utmost importance to the security and confidentiality of the data of Alan's services‚Äô users, whether on the
alan.com
website or on the mobile application made available to them.
The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you understand how we treat the personal data you provide us with, in accordance with the GDPR, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA") and, when applicable, the Personal Health Information Protection Act of Ontario ("PHIPA").
This privacy policy may be updated regularly, to enrich it, according to Alan's needs, circumstances or if required by law. We therefore invite you to check for updates on a regular basis, although we will always notify you of any significant changes affecting the way your data is processed.
Version dated July 2024
Key principles
Above all, we have set ourselves two key principles which are also included in our contracts:
Alan will never sell the data collected about its members in connection with the services offered.
We make our living by building and managing insurance products and services around health, not by reselling our users' data. Users remain in control of their data.
As a health insurer, Alan will never use health data to apply differentiated rates based on a member's situation or history.
We strongly believe in the strength of solidarity and risk sharing between insured members.
Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations and particularly the PIPEDA and GDPR, we undertake to collect and process only the data that is strictly necessary for their purpose. Similarly, we undertake to ensure that the data collected is kept in a form that allows your identification for a period that does not exceed the time required for the purposes for which the data is collected and processed.
Who is responsible for collecting your personal data ?
Alan, including all of its affiliates (Alan Insurance, Alan Services, Alan Tech, Marmot Belgium, Marmot Iberia, and Alan CA) is responsible for collecting your personal data.
üá™üá∫Ô∏è
For EU residents:
Alan is a health insurer and does not mainly act as a data processor for our clients but as a data controller in the sense of article 4 of the GDPR on all operations relating to its insurance and health services described in this policy.
Alan, including all of its affiliates (Alan Insurance, Alan Services, Alan Tech, Marmot Belgium and Marmot Iberia, Alan CA) is a health insurer and does not mainly act as a data processor for our clients but as a data controller in the sense of article 4 of the GDPR on all operations relating to its insurance and health services described in this policy :
Alan determines the means and purposes of data processing necessary for the implementation of the complementary health protection of employees. In practice, only employees' professional email addresses are transmitted by the company to Alan. Other information is directly communicated by the employee or his beneficiary;
The operations carried out on the data by Alan are necessary for its own activity as a health insurer and not for that of the companies that choose Alan as insurer for their employees. The criteria mentioned in
the data processor‚Äôs guide
issued in September 2017 by the CNIL exclude Alan's qualification as a subcontractor.
However, Alan can also process personal data on behalf of its client companies, within the scope of certain services provided on the Alan platform, in particular administrative management assistance services for human resources. Alan acts as a "data processor" of the company, and the processing of personal data is done under the responsibility of the company, which then acts as the data controller. The General Conditions governing the relationship between Alan and the client companies include a data processing agreement (DPA) reflecting this distribution. You can take a look at the privacy policies of the client companies directly for more details on how they process your personal data.

Name, surname and social security number
Employees' professional email address
Personal e-mail address of former employees
Dates of arrival and departure from the company

Alan processes this data on the basis of pre-contractual measures and the execution of the insurance contract between Alan and its members.

5 years after the end of the contract for health insurance contracts
2 years after the last connection if the contract has not been signed

No, Alan has to keep it for 5 years after the end of the cover.
Health insurance
Personal data is transmitted to us directly by or on behalf of the insured members with their explicit consent (e.g. to automate the retrieval of receipts from a third party site), in particular :
Name and surname
Personal email address
Insurance policy number
Birth date
Postal address
Name, surname, birth date and gender of the spouse and/or children where applicable

Other insurance plan information (if any, for coordination of benefits)

Proof of exemption where applicable
üá™üá∫Ô∏è
For EU residents - On what legal basis?
This data is required for the execution of the contract concluded with Alan (or with your insurer that delegates your contract to Alan), either by your employer or by you as an insured member. They are therefore not subject to prior consent. We also have a legal obligation to ask you for this information in order to comply with the regulations that apply to our insurance activities and to our health and management service providers activities.
In addition, we use it for some of the secondary purposes listed below on the basis of our legitimate interest in managing our insurance activities.
What do you do with it?
We use this data mainly to process requests for reimbursement of expenses according to the guarantees of the contract which covers the insured members and any declared beneficiaries. In particular, this involves receiving and processing the health documents and information provided to justify the care received, determine coverage, generate payments and manage the recovery of undue payments.
Your documents are analyzed within the European Union and, as part of a test, in Tunisia. These transfers are adequately covered by binding corporate rules (BCR) validated by the CNIL and its European counterparts. 

They are also used for :
the execution of legal, regulatory and administrative provisions
the prevention of fraud, in particular the analysis and detection of anomalous acts or the management of alerts and procedures following a case of fraud
management of complaints and disputes
the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism
the drawing of statistics and actuarial studies, the development and management of insurance products
management of financial aspects, performance and risk
management of Alan's websites and applications (including bug and error management)
customer relationship management and service improvement
user research and surveys
How long do you keep this data?
5 years after the end of the contract for health insurance contracts
Can I ask to have my data deleted?
No, because we are obliged to keep this data. However, you have the possibility to ask us not to use them for purposes based on our legitimate interest, by sending an email to privacy@alan.com.
Dependent data
I have been added as a dependent
When the possibility is offered to him/her and an insured member declares a dependent (spouse or child) to his/her contract, he/she vouches that the beneficiary agrees to become a party to its insurance contract (or gives consent as a parent of a minor). Alan treats the personal data of the dependent in the same way as those of any other user insured member in this capacity.
Account sharing
Our insured members and their dependents share a single Alan account. By default, both the insured members and the dependents (if they are of legal age and choose to access Alan's online insurance or management services themselves) will be able to view all account information related to the insurance services, without separation. Members with an Alan account can also choose to restrict visibility of their care acts to other members covered under the same policy.
How can I have access to this privacy setting?
Through the "Privacy and security" section on your member profile.
STATISTICS AND PERFORMANCE
Measuring our members‚Äô satisfaction
Because it is important for us to build a tailored service for our members, we measure their satisfaction over time through a rating system that our members can choose to enter in the application.  This is the "Net Promoter Score" or "NPS".
üá™üá∫Ô∏è
For EU residents - On what legal basis?
It is in Alan's legitimate interest to improve its services based on member satisfaction.
What do you do with it?
We use the NPS to monitor our performance with our members, through the Metabase tool. In concrete terms, this allows us to identify factors of dissatisfaction that may allow us to improve our services or, conversely, things that need to be reinforced because they are highly appreciated.
How long do you keep this data?
We keep them for the time needed to carry out analyses and measure their evolution over several development cycles. We then anonymise or delete them.
Can I ask to have my data deleted?
Yes, simply send a request to
privacy@alan.com
.

Statistics and scientific research
Data collected by Alan in the performance of our services, may be further used in a way compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected. Only aggregated and/or anonymized data may become subject to scientific research and/or for statistical studies, including for statistical learning.  It could for instance be used in the selection and creation of relevant health stories to improve our services and Members' health, create aggregated usage reports or to streamline and improve the management of exchanges with Alan medical team.
How is my data protected?
Data security is an extremely important issue for Alan: we do our utmost to be worthy of the trust you place in us. Here are a few examples of the measures we have taken. If you have any questions on a specific point, we will be happy to answer them at
security@alan.com
.
Application security
We use Datadog App Security (previously Sqreen. com)  to detect and block in real time attacks such as XSS, SQL injection, account theft, etc.
We also use Cloudflare.com to protect us from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
Encryption of data in transit
All HTTP traffic to and from alan.com and api.alan.com is encrypted (HTTPS / TLS). You can evaluate our configuration
here
.
The first time a user logs on, we tell their browser (via the HSTS mechanism) that all subsequent connections must be encrypted (HTTPS), including when a link to alan.com starts with http:// instead of https://.
Hosting and database
For data hosting and processing, Alan uses AWS, which is HDS-certified. Our entire infrastructure is located in the Frankfurt region, in Germany. 

In order to fulfill all the purposes for which we collect your data, we may transfer some of your data to third parties, who host it in data centers located within and outside the European Union. When data is hosted outside the European Union, we make sure that hosting is subject to European data protection standards (for example, by including standard contractual clauses in our contracts with such third parties). 
You can find more information on data privacy with AWS security
here
, and our blog post on the subject
here
.
Encryption of data at rest
We use PostgreSQL databases. The data is encrypted using the AES-256 standard and the encryption keys are managed by AWS.
The backup archives are also encrypted.
Password policy and storage
We use the open-source zxcvbn library to let users know the strength of the password they choose. The minimum size is 9 characters, and the minimum score is 3.
We do not store these passwords: we only store a non-reversible hash calculated by the open-source bcrypt library, with the following parameters :
a cost of 12 (i.e. 4096 iterations) to limit brute force type attacks
one random salt per user to protect against rainbow tables
Organisational measures
All Alan employees receive mandatory training in security (including social engineering) and data privacy. They use complex and unique passwords and strong authentication (2FA) whenever possible. The use of a password manager such as 1Password is also mandatory.
Our computers are automatically updated and have their hard disk encrypted (in case of theft). Our screens lock automatically.
Access to our internal administration tools requires individual access from an authorised IP address and all data modifications (by an Alan employee or by a user himself) are audited.
We organise intrusion tests by independent companies.
All Alan services and applications are developed in-house. Our code is validated by automated tools (static analysis, security, etc.) and manually by a second pair of eyes.
üë©‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è
What can I do on my side?
In order to protect your data on your computer or mobile phone, you can take a few simple measures:
apply regular system updates to benefit from security patches;
use antivirus software to detect the presence of malware or spyware, or to disable security features;
protect your passwords well (your Alan account password, your mailbox password...);
enable Privacy mode in the mobile application. You will then be prompted for biometric authentication (Face ID/TouchID) or a PIN every time you open the application.
You can also consult the
official recommendations
on good IT security practices.
