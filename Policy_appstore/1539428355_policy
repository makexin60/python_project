Use of service
Thrive Learning and Skills Platform
Our Learning Experience Platform allows users (typically medium to large size organisations) to create and share training materials with their workforce. The Platform can also be used by customers to organise training and learning materials into campaigns to be shared with users on the system, or to assign mandatory training to large groups of users on the system. Users are also able to create and share content with others on the system for the purpose of knowledge sharing.
Use by Thrive
Data within these Platforms is processed on an automated basis to help generate suggestions for content users may be interested in, and streamlining user experiences as they create content. Insights from data may be used to offer tag suggestions or content recommendations to other sites, but no personally identifiable data or customer-owned content shall be made visible as part of this processing.
We utilise sub-processors to send system notifications to end users based upon their own activity or the activity of other users on the site.
We do not share any information about customers or end users with any third parties except for the purposes outlined above.
Use by Customers
Customer organisations use the Service to share content, track compliance and monitor the engagement of users with content across the system. Thrive does not control the content shared on these Systems or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Service. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies. Thrive processes our customers’ information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers’ servers.
Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service, as permitted by this Product Privacy Policy, and as required by law.
We use the information collected through our Service by our customers for the following purposes: to provide the Service (which may include the detection, prevention and resolution of security and technical issues); to respond to customer support requests, and otherwise to fulfil obligations under the Customer Terms of Service.
We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customer's control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from using the Subscription Service. We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage.

This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.
Mobile Applications
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Apps on your mobile device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. In addition to information we collect on our Websites, when you use our Mobile Apps we may also collect your city location, device model and version, device identifier (or “UDID”), OS version, and your Service credentials.
We send push notifications from time to time in order to update you about content and events within your organisation. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
We may link information we store within the analytics software to Personal Information you submit within the Mobile App. We do this to improve services we offer you and improve our marketing, analytics and site functionality.
