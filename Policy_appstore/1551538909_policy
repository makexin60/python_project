Privacy Policy
Last updated: March 12. 2021
This Privacy Policy applies to all of Kristanix's Apple Arcade games (collectively the "Games"). By using our Games, you acknowledge and consent to the terms of this privacy policy.
This policy will let you know:
What information (often referred to as "data") is collected.
We will comply with all relevant and applicable legislative requirements, and, in the event of any inconsistency, the legislative requirements will override the provisions of this document.
Data collected and how its used
Certain data is collected automatically:
Data about your gameplay progress is sent to Apple Game Center (if you connect the game to Game Center). Used for game leaderboards and unlocking game achievements.
Data about your gameplay progress is sent to Apple CloudKit. Used for synchronizing your gameplay data between your Apple devices.
We do not utilise any other third-party partners that collect data, and no data is sent to us or our servers.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of children is of the utmost importance to us. Our Games have been designed to be family friendly and to be suitable for use by children. We have limited the way in which we collect data to ensure we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection (COPPA) guidelines for the appropriate use of information collection and access to children's personal information. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a person under the age of 13, please contact us at the email address below and the information will be permanently deleted.
Policy Updates
This Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of our Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.kristanix.com/privacy/arcade.php. We will always keep this up to date so that you know what information we will collect from you, how we may use it, and when we may disclose it.

Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 17. 2023
This Privacy Policy applies to all of Kristanix's games, websites and other related services (collectively the "Services"). By using our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the terms of this privacy policy.
This policy will let you know:
What information (often referred to as "data") is collected.
How your information is used.
With whom your information may be shared.
How you can access, update, or delete your information.
We will comply with all relevant and applicable legislative requirements, and, in the event of any inconsistency, the legislative requirements will override the provisions of this document.
Data collected automatically
Certain data is collected automatically. This includes:
Anonymous data about your game progress.
Anonymous data about your device, such as device name, operating system, browser type and language.
Mobile device identifier (advertising ID). There are ways to prevent this, which are outlined in the advertising/third-party lists below. On iOS 14.5+ this is not collected.
We do not use cookies on our website.
Data you provide us
We collect and store your email address when you sign up for a Kristanix account.
Data we collect from our third-party partners
To operate and manage our Services we need to use third-party service providers from time to time. A list of those parties can be found in this privacy policy. The type of information we might collect from them includes:
Anonymous data for analytics purposes, so we can keep improving our games.
Demographic data (such as which country you are from).
How do we use the data we collect?
Data collected will always be treated securely and in accordance with this document, and any applicable legislation. We may analyze, profile and segment all collected data in anonymized form, to improve our games.
If any app crashes occur, we collect anonymous, non-personal device information provided automatically by your device to help understand what caused the crash.
Advertising
If you have purchased any ad-free versions of our games (or any puzzle/board packs), no ads are shown to you and therefore no data is collected by advertisers.
Advertisements from third-party ad networks may be displayed in the free versions of our games. We take great care in selecting advertising partners. We do not work with companies delivering ads of inappropriate content. As we do not have direct control of which ads are shown in our apps at any given moment, we encourage you to contact us if you find ads in our apps that violate this policy, and report those ads by clicking on the "?", "i" or "ad" icon that's usually in the corner of the ad.
Through our games, you can decline consent so that the advertisers will not be able to collect data in order to show you targeted advertisements.

Opting out of targeted advertising
You can also opt-out of targeted-based advertising in all apps, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android). This will prevent mobile device identifier from being collected from all apps on your device.
Analytics
Our Services may also contain APIs from other third-parties used for non-identifiable, anonymous statistical and analytical purposes. Here is a list of their privacy policies:

If you wish to know what data we hold about you, if any, or have it deleted, please make out your request to us at the email address listed below. Please be aware that in order to protect the information in our database, we will require identification from you before releasing any information.
