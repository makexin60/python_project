Receipts supports integration with Google Drive. The app supports saving and restoring backup files to Google Drive (under Settings->Save Backup and Settings->Restore Backup). Reports may also be uploaded to Google Drive under the Reports tab (select 'Google Drive' as the report destination). In addition, the sync feature is supported using Google Drive. If enabled (under Settings->Sync), this will upload and download receipts data and attachment files (photos, etc.) to multiple devices.
