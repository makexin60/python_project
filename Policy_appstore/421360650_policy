Privacy Policy
Changes to our Privacy Policy: last modified 29 May 2024.
Device data
General technical data, such as phone model, OS version, country and language, is transferred to WomanLog servers solely for statistical purposes.
Personal data
Your email address is required in order to create your WomanLog account. Although a WomanLog account is not required for using our apps, it is recommended for backup and restoring data. If you create a WomanLog account, your WomanLog app data will be encrypted and stored on WomanLog servers. Access to your data will only be possible by using the 'Sign In' feature with your WomanLog account (email address and password).
To create a WomanLog account, you will need to provide an email address. Your WomanLog account will only be created after verifying your email address by pressing the link in the confirmation email. If you want to delete your WomanLog account and the stored data, you can do so at any time by following these steps: open the WomanLog app, sign in to your WomanLog account in Settings -> WomanLog Account, press the button "..." in the right upper corner, and press on 'Delete Account.'

Key external service providers
Hetzner Online GmbH: WomanLog apps use Hetzner Online GmbH for hosting, ensuring that our data is securely stored on Hetzner Online GmbH European Union based servers. All data stored with Hetzner Online GmbH is encrypted by the WomanLog apps.
Firebase: WomanLog apps employ Firebase, a set of performance analysis and monitoring tools provided by Google Inc. Firebase helps us track overall app performance and stability, manage internal version control, identify bugs, and prioritize fixes. To achieve this, Firebase collects your IP address, device identifier, and event and usage data related to your use of WomanLog apps. This data is transferred to and stored on a server in the EU, operated by Google, LLC.
Health data
The optional "Intelligent Assistant" feature provides fine-tuned personalised menstruation and fertility forecasts, as well as other useful forecasts, all tailored to your data. You can use this feature only if you agree to send health data (such as body measurements, dates of your past and current periods, symptoms – all data except notes) from WomanLog apps to WomanLog servers. This data is stored and processed anonymously – no personal data is connected to this data. WomanLog utilizes this data to offer you 'Intelligent Assistant' services and to generate WomanLog sample data ('training data') for predicting menstruation and fertility. WomanLog apps will not share any of your health or personal data with third parties.
Intelligent Assistant - Chat
WomanLog apps provide access to Artificial Intelligence models and technologies that allow to chat with Artificial Intelligence and get answers to your questions. This chat function is designed to assist with queries related to using WomanLog apps, adding entries, and general women's health topics. The underlying technology of WomanLog apps relies on the OpenAI API, which is accessible at

Any personal information that you provide by email to our Support will only be used for our support services. We will not sell or redistribute your information to any third party.
