If you have a paid account, you do not receive ads. This includes customers using Outlook with a Microsoft 365 account provided by their company, school, or organization. It also includes those who have a Microsoft 365 Basic, Personal, or Family subscription.
If you use a free email service such as Outlook.com, Hotmail, or Gmail without a Microsoft 365 subscription, you’ll see ads in your inbox clearly marked with an ad label to distinguish them from other emails. If you prefer not to see ads, you may
purchase a Microsoft 365 subscription
to remove any advertising served by Microsoft. Experiences for Microsoft 365 for Business and education subscribers may vary by plan.
Customers who have a Microsoft 365 Basic, Personal, or Family plan get an ad-free inbox, 100 GB of Outlook mailbox storage, and advanced security features
