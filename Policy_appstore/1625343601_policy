Current
Google Cloud & the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The
General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) is a privacy legislation that replaced the
95/46/EC Directive on Data Protection
of 24 October 1995 on May 25, 2018. GDPR lays out specific requirements for businesses and organizations who are established in Europe or who serve users in Europe. It:
Regulates how businesses can collect, use, and store personal data
Builds upon current documentation and reporting requirements to increase accountability
Authorizes fines on businesses who fail to meet its requirements
At Google Cloud, we champion initiatives that prioritize and improve the security and privacy of customer personal data, and want you, as a Google Cloud customer, to feel confident using our services in light of GDPR requirements. If you partner with Google Cloud, we will support your GDPR compliance efforts by:
Committing in our contracts to comply with the GDPR in relation to our processing of customer personal data in all Google Cloud and Google Workspace services
Offering additional security features that may help you to better protect the personal data that is most sensitive
Giving you the documentation and resources to assist you in your privacy assessment of our services
Continuing to evolve our capabilities as the regulatory landscape changes
Google Workspace & Google Cloud Commitments to the GDPR
Data controllers must use data processors with appropriate technical and organizational measures. When conducting your GDPR assessment of Google Cloud consider the following:

EXPERT KNOWLEDGE, RELIABILITY & RESOURCES
Data Protection Expertise
Google employs security and privacy professionals that include some of the world’s foremost experts in information, application, and network security. This expert team is tasked with maintaining the company’s defense systems, developing security review processes, building stronger security infrastructure, and precisely implementing Google’s security policies.
Google also employs an extensive team of lawyers, regulatory compliance experts, and public policy specialists who look after privacy and security compliance for Google Cloud.
These teams work with customers, industry stakeholders, and supervisory authorities to ensure our Google Workspace and Google Cloud services can help customers meet their compliance needs.
DATA PROTECTION COMMITMENTS
Data Processing Agreements
Our data processing agreements for
Google Workspace
and
Google Cloud
clearly articulate our privacy commitment to customers. We have evolved these terms over the years based on feedback from our customers and regulators.
We specifically updated these terms to reflect the GDPR, and, to facilitate our customers' compliance assessment and GDPR readiness when using Google Cloud services. Learn more about the
Google Workspace Data Processing Amendment
, the
Google Workspace EU Standard Contract Clauses
, the
Google Cloud Data Processing and Security Terms
, and the
Google Cloud EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCCs)
.
Our customers can enter into these updated data processing terms via the opt in process described for the
Google Workspace Data Processing Amendment
and the
Google Cloud Data Processing and Security Terms
.
Processing According to Instructions
Any data that a customer and its users put into our systems will only be processed in accordance with the customer’s instructions, as described in our GDPR-updated data processing agreements.
Personnel Confidentiality Commitments
All Google employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement and complete mandatory confidentiality and privacy trainings, as well as our Code of Conduct training. Google’s Code of Conduct specifically addresses responsibilities and expected behavior with respect to the protection of information.
USE OF SUBPROCESSORS
Google Group companies directly conduct the majority of data processing activities required to provide the Google Workspace and Google Cloud services. However, we do engage some third-party vendors to assist in supporting these services. Each vendor goes through a rigorous selection process to ensure it has the required technical expertise and can deliver the appropriate level of security and privacy.
We make information available about Google group subprocessors supporting
Google Workspace
and
Google Cloud
services, as well as third-party subprocessors involved in those services. See
here
for Google Workspace subprocessor details, and
here
for Google Cloud subprocessor details. We also include commitments relating to subprocessors in our data processing agreements.
SECURITY OF THE SERVICES
According to the GDPR, appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be implemented to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
Google operates a global infrastructure designed to provide state-of-the-art security through the entire information processing lifecycle. This infrastructure is built to provide secure deployment of services, secure storage of data with end-user privacy safeguards, secure communications between services, secure and private communication with customers over the Internet, and safe operation by administrators. Google Workspace and Google Cloud run on this infrastructure.
We designed the security of our infrastructure in layers that build upon one another, from the physical security of data centers, to the security protections of our hardware and software, to the processes we use to support operational security. This layered protection creates a strong security foundation for everything we do. A detailed discussion of our Infrastructure Security can be found in
Google Infrastructure Security Design Overview Whitepaper
.
Availability, Integrity & Resilience
Google designs the components of our platform to be highly redundant. Google’s data centers are geographically distributed to minimize the effects of regional disruptions on global products such as natural disasters and local outages. In the event of hardware, software, or network failure, services are automatically and instantly shifted from one facility to another so that operations can continue without interruption. Our highly redundant infrastructure helps customers protect themselves from data loss.
Equipment Testing and Security
Google utilizes barcodes and asset tags to track the status and location of data center equipment from acquisition to installation, retirement, and destruction. If a component fails to pass a performance test at any point during its lifecycle, it is removed from inventory and retired. Google hard drives leverage technologies, such as Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and drive locking, to protect data at rest.
Disaster Recovery Testing
Google conducts disaster recovery testing on an annual basis to provide a coordinated venue for infrastructure and application teams to test communication plans, fail-over scenarios, operational transition, and other emergency responses. All teams that participate in the disaster recovery exercise develop testing plans and post mortems which document the results and lessons learned from the tests.
Encryption
Google uses encryption to protect data in transit and at rest. Google Workspace data in transit between regions is protected using HTTPS, which is activated by default for all users. Google Workspace and Google Cloud services encrypt customer content stored at rest, without any action required from customers, using one or more encryption mechanisms. A detailed discussion of how we encrypt data can be found in these resources:
Workspace Encryption Whitepaper
, and Google Cloud Encryption
in transit
and
at rest
.
Access Controls
For Google employees, access rights and levels are based on job function and role, using the concepts of least-privilege and need-to-know to match access privileges to defined responsibilities. Requests for additional access follow a formal process that involves a request and an approval from a data or system owner, manager, or other executives, as dictated by Google’s security policies. Data centers that house Google Cloud systems and infrastructure components are subject to physical access restrictions and equipped with 24 x 7 on-site security personnel, security guards, access badges, biometric identification mechanisms, physical locks and video cameras to monitor the interior and exterior of the facility.
Incident Management
Google has a dedicated security team responsible for security and privacy of customer data and managing security 24 hours a day and 7 days a week worldwide. Individuals from this team receive incident-related notifications and are responsible for helping resolve emergencies 24 x 7. Incident response policies are in place and procedures for resolving critical incidents are documented. Information from these events is used to help prevent future incidents and can be used as examples for information security training. Google incident management processes and response workflows are documented. Google’s incident management processes are tested on a regular basis as part of our ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018, ISO/IEC 27001, PCI-DSS
1
, SOC 2 and FedRAMP programs to provide our customers and regulators with independent verification of our security, privacy, and compliance controls. More information on our incident response process can be found in our
Data incident response process whitepaper
.
Vulnerability Management
We scan for software vulnerabilities using a combination of commercially available and purpose-built in-house tools, intensive automated and manual penetration testing, quality assurance processes, software security reviews, and external audits. We also rely on the broader security research community and greatly value their help identifying any vulnerabilities in Google Workspace, Google Cloud, and other Google products. Our Vulnerability Reward Program encourages researchers to report design and implementation issues that may put customer data at risk.
Product Security: Google Workspace
Google Workspace customers can leverage product features and configurations to further protect personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing:
Google Workspace Core Services

Product Security: Google Cloud
Google Cloud customers can leverage product features and configurations to further protect personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing:
Encryption in transit between regions
is applied by default on Google Cloud to encrypt requests before transmission and to protect the raw data using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Once data is transferred to Google Cloud to be stored, Google Cloud applies
encryption at rest
by default.
2-step verification
reduces the risk of unauthorized access by asking users for additional proof of identity when signing in.
Security key enforcement
offers another layer of security for user accounts by requiring a physical key.
Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM)
allows you to create and manage fine-grained access and modification permissions for Google Cloud resources.
Data Loss Prevention API
, part of Sensitive Data Protection (a family of services designed to help you discover, classify, and protect your most sensitive data), helps to identify and monitor the processing of special categories of personal data in order to implement adequate controls.

DATA RETENTION & DELETION
Administrators can export customer data, via the functionality of the
Google Workspace
or Google Cloud services (consult
Google Cloud documentation
for further information), at any time during the term of the agreement. We have included data export commitments in our data processing terms for several years, and will continue to work to enhance our data export capabilities, making it even easier for you to download a copy of your customer data from
Google Workspace
and Google Cloud services.
You can also delete customer data, via the functionality of the Google Workspace or Google Cloud services, at any time. When Google receives a complete deletion instruction from you (such as when an email you have deleted can no longer be recovered from your “trash”), Google will delete the relevant customer data from all of its systems within a maximum period of 180 days unless retention obligations apply.
ASSISTANCE TO THE CONTROLLER
Data Subject's Rights
Data controllers can use the Google Workspace and Google Cloud administrative consoles and services functionality to help access, rectify, restrict the processing of, or delete any data that they and their users put into our systems. This functionality will help them fulfill their obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR.
Data Protection Team
Google has designated a DPO for Google LLC and its subsidiaries, to cover data processing subject to the GDPR, including as part of our Cloud products and services. Kristie Chon Flynn is Google's Data Protection Officer. Kristie Chon Flynn is based in Sunnyvale in the U.S.
Where required, Google Cloud products have designated teams to address customer inquiries in relation to data protection. The way to contact these teams is described in the relevant agreement. For Google Workspace the Cloud Data Protection Team can be contacted by Customer’s administrators at
https://support.google.com/a/contact/googlecloud_dpr
(while administrators are signed in to their admin account) and/or directly by providing a notice to Google as described in the applicable agreement. For Google Cloud, that team can be contacted at
https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/dpo
.
Incident Notifications
Google Workspace and Google Cloud have provided contractual commitments around incident notification for many years. We will continue to promptly inform you of incidents involving your customer data in line with the data incident terms in our current agreements.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
The GDPR provides for several mechanisms to facilitate transfers of personal data outside of the EU. These mechanisms are aimed at confirming an adequate level of protection or ensuring the implementation of appropriate safeguards when personal data is transferred to a third country.
An adequate level of protection can be confirmed by adequacy decisions such as the ones that support the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and the Swiss Data Protection Act.
Where personal data will be transferred outside of the EU to third countries not covered by adequacy decisions, we commit under our data processing agreements to maintain a mechanism that will facilitate these transfers as required by the GDPR. In 2017, we gained confirmation of compliance from European Data Protection Authorities for our standard contract clauses, affirming that our contractual commitments for Google Workspace and Google Cloud met the requirements to legally frame transfers of personal data from the EU to the third countries that do not provide adequate protection.

Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Google Cloud and GDPR
Collapse all
Does the GDPR require storage of personal data in the EU?
No. Like the
95/46/EC Directive on Data Protection
, the GDPR sets out certain conditions for the transfer of personal data outside of the EU. Such conditions can be met via mechanisms such as standard contract clauses.
How do your terms reflect the GDPR requirements?
For many years, Google Cloud has offered data processing terms that clearly articulate our privacy and security commitment to customers, and we have evolved those terms to reflect the GDPR. Our GDPR-updated terms notably reflect the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR governing the use of a data processor by a data controller.
Does the GDPR give customers the right to audit Google Cloud?
Under the GDPR, audit rights must be granted to data controllers in their contracts with data processors. Our updated data processing agreements include audit rights for the benefit of customers who are subject to the GDPR.
What role do third-party ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018, ISO/IEC 27701 and SOC 2/3 reports play in compliance with the GDPR?
Our third-party ISO/IEC certifications and SOC 2/3 audit reports can be used by customers to help conduct their risk assessments and help them determine whether appropriate technical and organizational measures are in place. Our ISO/IEC 27701 certification provides greater clarity on privacy-related roles and responsibilities, which can facilitate efforts to comply with privacy regulations, including the GDPR.
How does Google Cloud support International Data Transfers in the Cloud?
The GDPR provides for several mechanisms to facilitate transfers of personal data outside of the EU. These mechanisms are aimed at confirming an adequate level of protection or ensuring the implementation of appropriate safeguards when personal data is transferred to a third country.
An adequate level of protection can be confirmed by adequacy decisions such as the ones that support the Japanese
Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)
and the Swiss Data Protection Act.
Where personal data will be transferred outside of the EU to third countries not covered by adequacy decisions, we commit under our data processing agreements to maintain a mechanism that will facilitate these transfers as required by the GDPR. In 2017, we gained confirmation of compliance from European Data Protection Authorities for our standard contract clauses, affirming that our contractual commitments for Google Workspace and Google Cloud met the requirements to legally frame transfers of personal data from the EU to the third countries that do not provide adequate protection.
Now that Privacy Shield has been invalidated, can I still use Google Cloud and meet GDPR requirements if I handle EU personal data?
While Google will continue to review the impact of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case C-311/18 one thing remains unchanged: Google will take appropriate steps to ensure we maintain a high level of privacy protection for EU citizens.
Google Cloud offers Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to our customers, which will be automatically deemed to apply in the absence of any alternate transfer solution made available by Google. Regardless of the location of the data, data protection remains a priority for Google. See the
Safeguards for International Data Transfers with Google Cloud Whitepaper
for more information.
We are certified against recognised international standards such as
ISO/IEC 27001

GDPR FAQs
Overview and GDPR basics
What is the GDPR?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European privacy law that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR replaced the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as
Directive 95/46/EC
, and intended to harmonize data protection laws throughout the European Union (EU) by applying a single data protection law that is binding throughout each member state.
Who does the GDPR apply to?
The GDPR applies to all organizations established in the EU and to organizations, whether or not established in the EU, that process the personal data of EU individuals in connection with either the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of behavior that takes place within the EU. Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including names, email addresses and phone numbers.
Is AWS a data processor or a data controller under the GDPR?
AWS acts as both a data processor and a data controller under the GDPR.
AWS as a data processor
– When customers use AWS services to process personal data in the content they upload to the AWS services, AWS acts as a data processor. Customers can use the controls available in AWS services, including security configuration controls, for the handling of personal data. Under these circumstances, the customer may act as a data controller or data processor itself, and AWS acts as a data processor or sub-processor. AWS offers a GDPR-compliant
AWS Data Processing Addendum
(AWS DPA) that incorporates AWS’s commitments as data processor. The AWS DPA, which includes Standard Contractual Clauses, is part of the
AWS Service Terms
and is
automatically
available
for all customers who require this to comply with the GDPR.
AWS as a data controller
– When AWS collects personal data and determines the purposes and means of processing that personal data – for example, when AWS stores account information (e.g. email addresses provided during the account registration) for account registration, administration, services access, or contact information for the AWS account to provide assistance through customer support activities – it acts as a data controller. Please see the
AWS Privacy Notice
for details on how AWS processes personal data as a controller.
What are the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)?
The SCCs are a pre-approved data transfer mechanism under GDPR, applicable in all EU Member States, which enable the lawful transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area that have not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission (third countries).
How does AWS incorporate the SCCs into the AWS GDPR DPA with customers?
The
AWS Service Terms
include the SCCs adopted by the European Commission (EC) in June 2021, and the AWS DPA confirms that the SCCs will apply automatically whenever an AWS customer uses AWS services to transfer customer data to countries outside of the European Economic Area that have not received an adequacy decision from the EC (third countries). As part of the AWS Service Terms, the new SCCs will apply automatically whenever a customer uses AWS services to transfer customer data to third countries. The few customers that have signed an AWS DPA can continue to rely on that AWS DPA because the new SCCs in the AWS Service Terms replace the previous version of the SCCs. Customers can therefore be comfortable that any customer data they transfer to third countries using AWS services has the same high level of protection that customer data receives in the EEA. For more information, please see the blog post on the implementation of the
new Standard Contractual Clauses
.
AWS and GDPR compliance following the Schrems II ruling and EDPB Recommendations
What are the Schrems II ruling and the EDPB Recommendations?
On 16 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling regarding the transfer of personal data of EU individuals outside the EEA (Schrems II). In Schrems II, the CJEU ruled that the EU-US Privacy Shield was no longer a valid mechanism to transfer personal data from the EEA to the US. However, in the same ruling, the CJEU confirmed that companies can (subject to implementing supplementary measures, if required) continue to use Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid mechanism for transferring personal data outside of the EEA. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a European body composed of representatives of the national data protection authorities, has since provided a non-exhaustive list of supplementary measures in its “Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data” (EDPB Recommendations).
The EDPB Recommendations provide data exporters with examples of supplementary measures that could be put in place. See FAQ
“
Can I continue to use AWS services following the Schrems II judgement?
" below for details on AWS’s data transfer resources.
Can I continue to use AWS services following the Schrems II ruling?
Yes, AWS customers can continue to use AWS services to transfer customer data from Europe to countries outside the EEA who have not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission. The Schrems II ruling validated the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a mechanism for transferring customer data outside the EEA and AWS customers can continue to rely on the SCCs for any transfer of customer data outside the EEA in compliance with GDPR.
Processing location.
Customers select the AWS Region in which their customer data will be stored. An overview of available AWS Regions can be found under
Regions and Availability Zones
. AWS will not process customer data outside the customer’s selected AWS Region unless it is necessary for the purpose of providing the AWS services initiated by the customer, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Please see our
Privacy Features
webpage to find out more on data transfers as part of AWS services.
Sub-processors.
AWS may use sub-processors, i.e. AWS affiliates or third parties to assist with the processing of customer data, to fulfil our obligations to customers under the AWS DPA, or to provide services on our behalf. See FAQ “
Does AWS use sub-processors to process customer data?
” below for details.
Transfer tools.
Since the Schrems II ruling has validated the use of SCCs as a mechanism for transferring data to countries outside the EEA who have not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission, our customers can continue to rely on the SCCs included in the
AWS DPA
if they choose to transfer their data outside the EEA in compliance with the GDPR.
Supplementary measures.
Customer control.
Customers have ownership and control over their customer data at all times through simple, yet powerful, tools that enable them to determine where their customer data will be stored, secure their customer data in transit and at rest, and manage user access to their AWS resources and modify, delete and retrieve customer data.
Technical and organizational measures.
AWS implements responsible and sophisticated technical and physical controls and processes designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data (visit the
AWS Compliance webpage
for more information). We also provide a number of advanced encryption and key management services (including services which allow customers to manager their own keys) that customers can use to protect their customer data both in transit and at rest - encrypted customer data is rendered inaccessible without the applicable decryption keys. Regardless of whether customer data is encrypted or unencrypted, we will always work vigilantly to protect customer data from any unauthorized access.
Law enforcement requests.
AWS has internal processes to deal with requests that we receive from law enforcement. When we receive a request for customer data from law enforcement, we carefully examine it to authenticate accuracy and to verify that it is appropriate and complies with all applicable laws. Unless legally prohibited from doing so, AWS notifies customers before disclosing customer data so that customers can take further steps to seek protection from disclosure. In the
Supplementary Addendum to the AWS DPA
(Supplementary Addendum), AWS makes strengthened contractual commitments in relation to dealing with government requests for customer data, including by committing to (i) use every reasonable effort to redirect any governmental body requesting customer data to the relevant customer, (ii) promptly notify the request to the customer if legally permitted to do so (including by using all reasonable and lawful efforts to obtain a waiver of prohibition if necessary), (iii) challenge any overbroad or inappropriate request, including where the request conflicts with EU law, and (iv) if, after exhausting the steps described above, AWS still remains compelled to disclose customer data in response to a governmental request, to disclose only the minimum amount of customer data necessary to satisfy the request.
Contractual measures.
AWS makes several contractual commitments to the measures described above that are reflected in the AWS DPA and the Supplementary Addendum. The AWS DPA and the Supplementary Addendum include contractual commitments from AWS concerning (1) customer’s selection of AWS Regions in which customer data is stored and processed, (2) both the technical and organizational measures that AWS has implemented to protect the AWS infrastructure and the technical organizational measures that customers may choose to apply to protect their customer data, (3) AWS’s measures to protect customer data and inform the customer in case of a data disclosure request from a governmental body, and (4) AWS’s ability to fulfil its obligations set forth in the AWS DPA in compliance with legislation applicable in a third country in which customer data is processed. The Supplementary Addendum also addresses (5) the statutory rights of individuals to claim for compensation in case of a violation of their rights granted by the GDPR.
Does AWS use sub-processors to process customer data?
Yes, AWS may use three types of sub-processors: (1) AWS entities that provide the infrastructure on which the AWS services run; (2) AWS entities that support specific AWS services which may require these entities to process customer data; and (3) third parties that AWS has contracted with to provide processing activities for specific AWS services. The
AWS Sub-processors webpage
provides more information about the sub-processors that AWS engages in accordance with the AWS DPA, to provide processing activities on customer data on behalf of customers. Sub-processors relevant to an individual customer will depend on the AWS Region the customer selects and the particular AWS services that the customer uses.
How does AWS help customers when they conduct data transfer assessments?
The AWS whitepaper,
Navigating Compliance with EU Data Transfer Requirements
, provides information about the services and resources that AWS offers customers to help them conduct data transfer assessments in light of the Schrems II ruling, and subsequent
recommendations
from the European Data Protection Board. The whitepaper also describes the key supplementary measures taken and made available by AWS to protect customer data.
How can I prove to a data protection authority that my use of the AWS services complies with the GDPR?
AWS offers helpful information to customers, including several compliance reports from third-party auditors, who have verified our compliance with a variety of security standards and regulations, to prove the high levels of compliance AWS maintains for its infrastructure. These reports show our customers, that we are protecting their customer data they choose to process on AWS. Examples of this include AWS' ISO 27001, 27017, and 27018 compliance.
ISO 27018
contains security controls that focuses on protection of customer data.
AWS is also compliant with the
CISPE Code of Conduct
for data protection. More information on the CISPE Code of Conduct can be found in the FAQ below, "
Does AWS comply with a GDPR approved Code of Conduct specific to cloud infrastructure services?
"
Does AWS comply with the GDPR approved CISPE Code of Conduct specific to cloud infrastructure services?
Yes. As of June 2023,
107 AWS services
are compliant with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) Data Protection Code of Conduct.
CISPE
is a coalition of cloud computing leaders serving millions of European customers. The
CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct
(CISPE Code), is the first pan-European data protection code of conduct focused on cloud infrastructure services providers. The CISPE Code was approved by the
European Data Protection Board
, acting on behalf of the 27 data protection authorities across Europe, and formally adopted by the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL), acting as the lead supervisory authority. In 2017 AWS announced its compliance with an earlier version of the CISPE Code.
The CISPE Code helps customers ensure that their cloud infrastructure service provider offers appropriate operational assurances to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and protect customer data. A few key benefits of the CISPE Code include:
Cloud infrastructure focused:
Clarifying the role of the cloud infrastructure service provider under GDPR with regard to the processing of customer data – that is, any personal data processed on behalf of the customer using the cloud infrastructure service.
Data in Europe:
Requires cloud infrastructure service providers to give customers the choice to use services to store and process customer data exclusively in the European Economic Area (EEA).
Data privacy:
The CISPE Code assures organizations that their cloud infrastructure service providers meets the requirements applicable to personal data processed on their behalf (customer data) under the GDPR.
The Certificate of Compliance that illustrates AWS compliance status is available on the
CISPE Public Register
. Listed AWS services have been independently verified as complying with the CISPE Code. The verification process was conducted by Ernst & Young CertifyPoint (EY CertifyPoint), an independent, globally recognized monitoring body accredited by CNIL.
Technical and organizational measures
How does the GDPR affect the AWS shared responsibility model?
The GDPR does not change the
AWS shared responsibility model
, which continues to be relevant for customers. The shared responsibility model is a useful approach to illustrate the different responsibilities of AWS (as a data processor or sub-processor) and customers (as either data controllers or data processors) under the GDPR.
Under the shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that supports AWS services (“Security “OF” the cloud”), and customers, acting either as data controllers or data processors, are responsible for any personal data they upload to AWS services (“Security “IN” the cloud”).
AWS responsibility "Security of the cloud"
- AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS services. This infrastructure is comprised of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS services, which provide powerful controls to customers, including security configuration controls, for the handling of customer content. AWS provides several compliance reports from third-party auditors who have verified our compliance with a variety of computer security standards and regulations (for more information, visit the
AWS Compliance webpage
). These reports show our customers, that we are protecting their customer data. Examples include AWS’ ISO 27001, 27017, and 27018 compliance.
ISO 27018
contains security controls that focuses on protection of customer data.
Customer responsibility “Security in the Cloud”
- AWS customers are responsible for architecting and securing the application and solutions they elect to deploy on AWS services. AWS customers are also responsible for configuring the AWS services in a way that protects the confidentiality, integrity and security needs of their customer data. The specific responsibilities customers have to secure their customer data vary depending on the AWS services customers elect to use and how those services are integrated into customers’ IT environments. AWS customers have visibility and control over their customer data and can implement flexible security controls based on the sensitivity of the specific type of customer data. Customers can do this by utilizing its own security measures and tools, or by using the security measures and tools made available by AWS or other suppliers. In this way, customers can put in place additional layers of security for more sensitive customer data.
AWS makes available products, tools and services that customers can use to architect and secure their applications and solutions and that can be deployed to help handle the requirements of GDPR, including:
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
enables organizations to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, customers can create and manage AWS users and groups as well as use permissions to allow and deny access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of AWS accounts offered at no additional charge.
AWS CloudTrail
allows organizations to log, continuously monitor, and retain information about account activity related to actions in AWS, which simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting (AWS CloudTrail is enabled on all AWS accounts by default).
Amazon GuardDuty
is a managed threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect AWS accounts and workloads. It monitors for activity that can indicate a possible account compromise, such as unusual API calls or potentially unauthorized deployments. GuardDuty also detects potentially compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.
Amazon Macie
is a machine learning tool to assist discovery and classification of personal data stored in Amazon S3.
Please see our whitepaper,
Navigating GDPR Compliance on AWS
, for further details on how to use AWS resources in compliance with the GDPR.
Do AWS Partners offer products and services to help with GDPR compliance?
Yes, you can search for “GDPR” in the
AWS Partner Solutions Finder
to help find ISVs, MSPs, and SI partners that have products and services to help with GDPR compliance. Customers can also search for “GDPR” solutions on
AWS Marketplace
.
Does AWS offer professional services help on GDPR compliance?

– This program allows organizations to measure their architecture against AWS best practices and to construct architectures that are secure, reliable, high performing, and cost-effective. Well-Architected Reviews also allows customers to understand where they have risks in their architecture and address them before applications are put into production.
How can AWS help customers meet their obligations under the GDPR, regarding notifications of personal data breaches?
AWS has a security incident monitoring and data breach notification process in place and will notify customers of breaches of AWS’s security without undue delay and in accordance with the AWS DPA. AWS also gives customers a number of tools to understand who has access to their resources, when, and from where. One of these tools is
AWS CloudTrail
which enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of an AWS account. With AWS CloudTrail, customers can log, continuously monitor, and retain information about account activity related to actions across their AWS infrastructure. This helps organizations understand what is happening with their AWS infrastructure and can take action on any unusual activity, immediately. For more information on other security tools AWS gives customers to help meet their obligations as data controllers under the GDPR, visit the
AWS Cloud Security webpage
.
How does AWS help me to protect my customer data against cyber-attacks?
AWS gives customers and APN Partners a number of tools to secure their customer data and help protect against cyber-attacks. One such tool is
AWS Shield
. This is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service to safeguard websites and applications running on AWS. AWS Shield Standard is available at no additional charge and provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that can minimize application downtime and latency. For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting web applications running on AWS and using ELB, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 resources, customers and APN Partners can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. AWS also publishes and routinely updates
AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency
that can help customers use AWS to build applications resilient to DDoS attacks.
Other tools AWS has to help protect customer data against cyber-attacks include:
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
enables organizations to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, customers and APN Partners can create and manage AWS users and groups as well as use permissions to allow and deny access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of AWS accounts offered at no additional charge.
AWS Config
allows customers and APN Partners to enable prepackaged rules which help ensure that their AWS resources are in a properly configured and compliant state.
AWS CloudTrail
allows organizations to log, continuously monitor, and retain information about account activity related to actions in AWS, which simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting (AWS CloudTrail is enabled on all AWS accounts by default).
Amazon GuardDuty
is a managed threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help protect AWS accounts and workloads. It monitors for activity that can indicate a possible account compromise, such as unusual API calls or potentially unauthorized deployments. GuardDuty also detects potentially compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.
What tools are available to help me identify personal data within my content on AWS?
Amazon Macie
is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect yourpersonal data in AWS. As organizations manage growing volumes of data, identifying and protecting their personal data at scale can become increasingly complex, expensive, and time-consuming. Amazon Macie automates the discovery of personal data at scale and lowers the cost of protecting your data. Macie automatically provides an inventory of Amazon S3 buckets including a list of unencrypted buckets, publicly accessible buckets, and buckets shared with AWS accounts outside those you have defined in AWS Organizations. Then, Macie applies machine learning and pattern matching techniques to the buckets you select to identify and alert you to personal data.
Amazon Macie is certified to internationally recognized standards, such as
ISO 27017
for cloud security,
ISO 27018
for cloud privacy, and customers and APN Partners can also use Macie to continuously monitor access to their data in order to detect suspicious activity based upon access patterns.
How can I control access to personal data within my content on AWS?
To help customers with GDPR compliance, AWS has a number of tools to control access to personal data contained in their content on AWS. These tools include:
Security by default means AWS services are designed to be secure by default. If the default configuration is used, access to resources is locked down to just the account owner and root administrator.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
enables customers to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, organizations can create and manage AWS users and groups as well as use permissions to allow and deny access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of AWS accounts offered at no additional charge.
AWS Multi-Factor Authentication
adds an extra layer of protection on top of an AWS account’s user name and password. AWS gives customers the option of virtual and hardware MFA devices.
AWS Directory Service
allows customers to integrate and federate with corporate directories to reduce administrative overhead and improve end-user experience.
AWS Config
allows customers to enable prepackaged rules which help ensure that their AWS resources are in a properly configured and compliant state.
AWS CloudTrail
allows customers to log, continuously monitor, and retain information about account activity related to actions across their AWS infrastructure, which simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting (AWS CloudTrail is enabled on all AWS accounts by default).
Amazon Macie
uses machine learning to help customers prevent data loss by automatically discovering, classifying, and protecting sensitive data in AWS. This fully managed service continuously monitors data access activity for anomalies, and generates detailed alerts when it detects risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent data leaks – such as sensitive data that a customer has accidentally made externally accessible.
How can I encrypt customer data in AWS to prevent unauthorized access?
AWS offers customers and APN Partners the ability to add an additional layer of security to their customer data at rest in the cloud and help them meet their security of processing obligations as data controllers under the GDPR.
Encryption
tools available on AWS include:
Data encryption capabilities available in AWS storage and database services, such as
Amazon Elastic Block Store
,
Amazon S3

AWS and the UK GDPR
Does the GDPR still apply to the UK?
The GDPR is an EU regulation and post-Brexit, no longer applies to the UK.  The UK government incorporated the requirements of GDPR into UK law as the “UK GDPR”.
How can customers use AWS in compliance with the UK GDPR?
AWS offers a UK GDPR-compliant
UK GDPR Addendum
to the
AWS DPA
that incorporates AWS’s commitments as a data processor under the UK GDPR.  The
UK GDPR Addendum
is part of the
AWS Service Terms
and applies automatically for all customers who require a data processing agreement to comply with the UK GDPR.
How can customers transfer customer data in compliance with the UK GDPR?
The
UK GDPR Addendum
, which is part of the
AWS Service Terms
, includes the SCCs adopted by the EC and the international data transfer addendum (IDTA)
issued by the UK data protection regulator
(the Information Commissioners Office).  The IDTA amends the SCCs to ensure they constitute an appropriate safeguard under the UK GDPR for international data transfers to countries outside of the UK that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (UK third countries).  The
UK GDPR Addendum
confirms that the SCCs (as amended by the IDTA) will automatically apply whenever a customer uses AWS services to transfer customer data subject to the UK GDPR (UK customer data) to UK third countries.  As part of the
UK GDPR Addendum
in the
AWS Service Terms
, the SCCs (as amended by the IDTA) will apply automatically whenever a customer uses AWS services to transfer UK customer data to UK third countries
AWS and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act
How can customers use AWS in compliance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act?
AWS offers a
Swiss Addendum
to the
AWS Data processing Addendum
(the
“Swiss Addendum”
) that incorporates AWS’s commitments as data processor under the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (the
“FDPA”
). The Swiss Addendum is part of the
AWS Service Terms
(see Section 1.14.4) and applies automatically when the FDPA applies to a customer’s use of the AWS services to process customer data.
How can customers transfer customer data in compliance with the FDPA?
The
Swiss Addendum
to the
AWS Data processing Addendum
which is part of the
AWS Service Terms
(see Section 1.14.4), includes the Standard Contractual Clauses (the
“SCCs”
) adopted by the European Commission and amended as required by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. The Swiss Addendum confirms that the SCCs (as amended by the Swiss Addendum) will automatically apply whenever a customer uses AWS services to transfer customer data subject to the FDPA to third countries.
Contact
Who should I contact if I have questions regarding the GDPR and AWS?
We recommend that customers with questions regarding the GDPR contact their AWS account manager first.
