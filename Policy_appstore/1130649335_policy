Information “Sharing” and “Selling”
We “share” certain personal information with third party ad networks for purposes of behavioral advertising, including: 
Commercial and Financial Information, Inferences, Internet Activity, Online Identifiers, and Personal Identifiers. This allows 
us to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We use third party data analytics providers and this may be considered a “sale” of information under the CCPA.
You may opt-out of these data practices
here
.
We do not knowingly sell or share (for cross-context behavioral advertising) the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
CCPA Rights
Your CCPA rights are described below. You can make a Request to Know or a Request to Delete under the CCPA by submitting a 
Privacy Request at the top of this page, or by clicking
here
,
or by emailing us at
consumerdata@azazie.com
.
Right to Know
You have the right to request to know the following about the personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 
months:
the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you
the categories of sources from which we collect personal information about you
the business and commercial purposes for which we collect personal information
the categories of third parties with whom we share the information
the categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third 
parties to whom we disclosed that information for a business purpose
The information we would provide to you in response to a Request to Know Categories is contained in this Privacy Notice. To 
access the specific personal information we have about you, submit a Request to Know via the link above. If you make a Request 
to Know more than twice in a 12-month period, we may require you to pay a small fee for this service.
Right to Delete
You have the right to request that we delete any personal information about you that you have provided to us. We will 
permanently delete from our records any personal information that is not necessary for our business operations and direct our 
service providers to do the same.
We consider information to be necessary for our business operations if it is used to:
Complete an obligation to you that you have requested
Detect and resolve issues related to security or functionality
Comply with legal obligations
Enable solely internal uses
Right to Non-Discrimination
If you exercise your CCPA consumer rights:
We will not deny goods or services to you
We will not charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other 
benefits or penalties
We will not provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you
Right to Opt-Out
You have the right to opt-out of any selling and sharing of your personal information.
You may exercise your right to opt-out
here
.
Opt-Out Preference Signals.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal to online services you 
visit. When we detect such signal, we place a U.S. Privacy String setting in your browser so that any third party who respects 
that signal will not track your activity on our website. GPC is supported by certain internet browsers or as a browser 
extension. You can find out how to enable GPC
here
.
Right to Correct
You have the right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data, taking into account the nature of the data and our purposes 
for processing it.
Request Verification
Before we can respond to a Request to Know or Request to Delete, we will need to verify that you are the consumer who is the 
subject of the CCPA request. Verification is important for preventing fraudulent requests and identity theft. Requests to 
Opt-Out do not require verification.
Typically, identity verification will require you to confirm certain information about yourself based on information we have 
already collected. For example, we will ask you to verify that you have access to the email address we have on file for you. 
If we cannot verify your identity based on our records, we cannot fulfill your CCPA request.
For a request that seeks specific personal information, we ask that you sign a declaration stating that you are the consumer 
whose personal information is the subject of the request, as required by the CCPA.
In some cases, we may have no reasonable method by which we can verify a consumer's identity. For example:
If a consumer submits a request but we have not collected any personal information about that consumer, we cannot verify the 
request.
If the only data we have collected about a consumer is gathered through website cookies (i.e. the consumer visited our 
website but had no other interaction with us), we are unable to reasonably associate a requester with any data collected; 
therefore, we cannot verify the request.
Authorized Agent
A California resident's authorized agent may submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete under the CCPA by emailing us at
consumerdata@azazie.com
. Requests 
submitted by an authorized agent will still require verification of the person who is the subject of the request in accordance 
with the process described above. We will also ask for proof that the person who is the subject of the request authorized an 
agent to submit a privacy request on their behalf. An authorized agent that has power of attorney pursuant to California 
Probate Code section 4121 to 4130 must submit proof of statutory power of attorney, but consumer verification is not required.

Opt-out preference signals
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit an opt-out preference signal,
    such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, to online services you visit. When we detect
    such signal, we place a U.S. Privacy String setting in your browser so that any third party
    who respects that signal will not track your activity on our website. Your request to opt-out
    of sale/sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only and not linked to any account
    information because the connection between your browser and the account is not known to us.
    GPC is supported by certain internet browsers or as a browser extension.
