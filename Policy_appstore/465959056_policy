This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
What personal information do we collect from iAllowance?
When you use iAllowance, your data is stored in your iAllowance account. This account is driven on the backend by Google's Firebase system and backed by all the controls and privacy set by Google. At no time does Jump Gap Software use your personal data for internal or external use. Jump Gap Software will never transmit or sell your data. Jump Gap Software may review your data for troubleshooting purposes only and only when you ask for help. Beyond the data you input from within the app, Jump Gap Software will not collect any other data.
The app also uses a crash reporter (Crashlytics) to aggregate and track crashes. These reports include non-identifiable information such as what iPhone you have, where the crash occurred. The use of Crashlytics allows Jump Gap Software to identify problems in the app and fix these problems quickly.
When do we collect information?
Data in your iAllowance account is collected (stored) as you use the app. A local copy of your data will exist on your device but the primary storage location for your data will be in your account.
How do we use your information?
The app does not use your personal information in any way. If requested, Jump Gap Software may look at your data for troubleshooting purposes only.
