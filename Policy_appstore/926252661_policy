Ring Privacy FAQ
When does Ring record or store my videos?
If you do not have a Ring Protect Plan, Ring does not record or store your videos, but you can still view your device's live video stream (Live View).
If you do have a Ring Protect Plan (including a free trial), Ring records and stores videos when motion is detected by your device (including devices linked to cameras such as an alarm system’s motion detector), the video doorbell button is pressed, or you initiate Live View. Video recordings in your account are automatically deleted following the expiration of your account’s applicable storage period under the Ring Protect Plan. For additional information regarding Ring’s video storage periods, see
here
.
What about videos I’ve created a share link for?
When you create a share link for one of your Ring videos, a copy of that video is made in the cloud to facilitate sharing. You can manage your shared videos in the Shared Video Management feature in Control Centre within the Ring App and Ring.com. There, you can unshare videos, which deletes the shared copies and makes the videos inaccessible to people with whom you previously shared those links. The original videos in your Ring account, however, are not deleted until you delete them in the Ring App or Ring.com, or they reach the expiration of your Ring Protect Plan’s applicable storage period.
How can I access and delete my video recordings?
If you have a Ring Protect plan (including a free trial), you can access your stored recordings, download them, manually delete them one by one, or delete them all at once in the Ring app or on Ring.com. Stored recordings are automatically deleted following the expiration of your Ring Protect plan’s applicable storage period. For additional information regarding Ring’s video storage periods, see
here
.
How secure are my video recordings?
You are always in control of who you grant video access to. By using the Shared Users function, you can add users to your account, who will then be able to view and download video recordings on the account. You can also share video recordings via text or email by creating a share link to the recording. After a share link has been created, the video recording may be viewed and downloaded by anyone with the share link ID. Additionally, you can make your videos publicly available by posting them on the Internet (including by posting them to the public social media app, Neighbors* by Ring).
Who can view my video recordings?
You’re in control of who you grant video access to. You can add Shared Users to your account, who will then be able to view and download video recordings on the account. You can also share video recordings via text or email by creating a share link to the recording. After a share link has been created, the video recording may be viewed and downloaded by anyone with the share link ID. Additionally, you can make your videos publicly available by posting them on the Internet (including by posting them to the public social media app Neighbors* by Ring).
Why should I add Shared Users?
The Shared Users function allows you to share device access with family, housemates, and others, without sharing your login credentials. Shared Users can answer and receive alerts, view video recordings, and modify their personal alert settings, but they cannot delete videos, delete devices, or change device settings.

law enforcement guidelines

Information We Obtain by Automated Means
When you interact with our products and services, we obtain in our role as a data controller certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
We may use these automated technologies to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, identifiers associated with your devices, types of devices connected to our services, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and dates and times of website or app visits.

Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our online services. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.
Information We Process On Behalf of Others
As a data processor, we process certain information on your behalf and to the extent necessary to provide you with certain services. This section describes the activities for which Ring serves as a data processor.
Our products and services are designed to allow you to see, hear and speak to anyone at your door from your computer or mobile device, and collaborate with others in your community. To provide you with these services, we process and store content (and related information) that is captured and recorded when using our products and services, such as video or audio recordings, live video or audio streams, images, comments, and data our products collect from their surrounding environment to perform their functions (such as motion, events, temperature and ambient light).
Privacy, data protection and video surveillance laws in your jurisdiction may apply to your use of our products and services.

For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using our products or services. Capturing, recording or sharing video or audio content that involves other people, or capturing others peoples’ facial feature information, may affect their privacy and data protection rights.

How We Protect Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
Policies for Children
We recognise the importance of protecting children’s online privacy. Ring’s products and services are intended for adults and are not directed to children.  If you're under 18, you may use Ring products and services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
Retention of Personal Information
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we retain personal information we obtain about you as long as (1) it is needed for the purposes for which we obtained it, in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Notice or (2) we have another lawful basis for retaining that data beyond the period for which it is necessary to serve the original purpose for collecting the data.
When you purchase our products, you may choose to use our Cloud Video Recording Service (“Cloud Service”) on a trial or subscription basis. If you have enabled the recording features of the Cloud Service, we retain the recordings (and any related information) from your product during your recording subscription period so you can access your content during that time period. You may delete your recordings from the Cloud Service at any time by accessing your account. It may take us up to 72 hours to remove those recordings.
