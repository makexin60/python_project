Location information. Unless otherwise expressly stated or with your consent, we do not collect your location information based on your device’s GPS or other device sensor data. However, we may collect your approximate location by calculating an imprecise latitude and longitude based on your IP address to provide you with better service (e.g. to connect you to the nearest and fastest VPN server).
VPN-Specific Information. Our VPN products do not log any information that associates your account credentials or identity with your VPN session activity. We do not maintain any records that show what websites you were browsing or apps accessed through a VPN connection. However, we will;

Ask you to rate your connection and provide some more detailed survey information if you are not satisfied with the service. This information is not tied to a specific user.
We may also assign your device a ‘hash’, which is a random ID generated when you first launch one of our VPN apps. Device hashes are not linked to VPN browsing activity or user identity, but may be used to measure individual user activity.

We receive information from reputable members of the security industry who provide information to help us to provide, develop, test, and improve our services (for example, lists of malicious URLs, spam blacklists, phone number blacklists, and sample malware). Some of this information may contain personal data on an incidental basis.

We use the information we collect for various purposes described below. For visitors from the European Economic Area (EEA) or U.K., please also note our lawful basis for each processing activity below;

We also use your information to enforce our legal rights and resolve disputes.
3. Who Do We Share Your Information With and Why?
3.1. In General
We may disclose your information in the following circumstances:
In accordance with your instructions or consent. For example, some services may allow you to register an account using a third party account (such as a Google or Microsoft account). If you choose to do so, we will share information with the third party account provider.
To your business organization (for our business services). If a business customer is providing you with access to our services through a business account, others in that organization may be able to see and manage the information necessary to maintain your account and the personal contact information associated with it (such as an administrator). Please note the following details about information shared as a result of these relationships;
Business organizations do not get access to, or receive any reports from, any network or Internet usage information related to your VPN activity.
Business organizations do not receive any information our identity products provide to you, such as information associated with your credit report, credit alerts, or other identity-related information unless you provide them with express consent for any such use in each instance of their request.
For collaborating with others on your behalf. Some services may provide ways for different users to interact or collaborate with each other. Your information will be shared in connection with those activities if you choose to engage in them.
Vendors and service providers. To help us provide some aspects of our services, we work with trusted third parties and partners (including affiliated companies in the Pango Group). To protect your data, we enter into appropriate confidentiality and data processing terms with these third parties, review their security practices, and limit information sharing to the scope of what they are helping us with. Examples of activities that third parties help us with include:
processing customer payments, e.g. Intersections, LLC
providing analytics about our services
providing sales and customer support
maintaining the infrastructure required to provide our services
delivering our marketing and advertising content.
To a new owner of UltraVPN or any of our assets. If ownership or control of all or part of our services, assets, or business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.
Aggregated or de-identified data. We may use and share aggregated data and data that is de-identified such that it no longer reveals the identity of an individual user for regulatory compliance, research and analysis, our own marketing and advertising activities and other legitimate business purposes.

If we share your information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is legally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are unlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid. To reiterate, our VPN products do not collect information about which websites you visit or apps you use, so this information is not accessible in a law enforcement request.
To enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.We may share limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our agreements with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against UltraVPN. We may also share your information in order to protect against fraud and abuse against UltraVPN, our affiliates, users and others.

4. Security
UltraVPN employs a range of administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or modification. Access to your Account Information and Services Information is restricted to our employees who require such access to perform their job functions.  While our controls are strong, no data security measures can guarantee 100% protection.
5. International Data Transfers
UltraVPN may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you reside. We do this to facilitate our operations, and transferees include other UltraVPN companies, service providers, and partners. Laws in other countries may be different to those that apply where you reside. For example, personal data collected within the U.K., Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred and processed in the United States for purposes described in this policy. However, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to ensure that such data receives an adequate level of protection, which typically includes UltraVPN and corporate recipients executing the Standard Contractual Clauses (aka ‘Model Contracts’) adopted by the European Commission or UK for such transfers to the U.S. You may contact us if you would like more information about such safeguards.
If you change your country of residence, the UltraVPN company responsible for your data may change accordingly, and your data may be transferred to that other company.
For users of our VPN products, if you are a UK or EEA resident and you choose to use our software to route your Internet traffic through servers in countries not deemed ‘adequate’ by the UK or EEA, then you acknowledge that such transfers are executed at your direction and with your unambiguous consent.
6. Data Retention
With respect to our VPN products, UltraVPN does not collect or retain data about your browsing activity while you are connected to the VPN Services. UltraVPN generally retains your personal information for as long as is needed to provide the services to you, or for as long as you have an account or subscription with us. We may also retain personal information if required by law, or for our legitimate interests, such as abuse detection and prevention, and defending ourselves from legal claims. Residual copies of personal data may be stored in backup systems for a limited period as a security measure to protect against data loss. For more information on the information stored, visit our VPN Products Privacy Notice.
7. Your Rights
Depending on your country of residence, you may have certain legal rights in relation to your personal data that we maintain. Subject to exceptions and limitations provided by applicable law, these may include the right to:
access and receive a copy of your personal data;
correct your personal data;
restrict the processing of your personal data;
object at any time to the processing of your personal data;
have your personal data erased;
data portability;
withdraw any consent you previously gave to the processing of your data (such as opting out to marketing communications);
lodge a complaint with a data protection authority;
request that we provide you with the categories of personal data we collect, disclose or sell about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal data; and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal data. This information may also be provided in this Privacy Policy.
You may be able to exercise some of these rights by using the settings and tools provided in our services. For example, you may be able to update your user account details via the relevant account settings screen of our apps. You may also be able to opt out from receiving marketing communications from us by clicking an “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in such communications.
Some mobile and web browsers transmit “do-not-track” or “opt-out preference” signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. Otherwise, if you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section below. As permitted by law, we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. You may also be permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. If you do so, you must give the authorized agent written permission to make such requests, or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
8. Your California Privacy Rights
The above information includes the categories of personal information UltraVPN collects, processes and shares with service providers and other businesses.  If you would like to exercise your rights to receive the specific pieces of information, or other rights indicated above applicable to you, please refer to the ‘Contact Us’ section below.
UltraVPN does not ‘sell’ or ‘share’ personal information for our own monetary benefit. However, as the CCPA defines ‘sell’ and ‘share’ broadly, some of the advertising services that support our website, marketing efforts, and mobile applications use third party advertising services that may be deemed a ‘sale’ or ‘sharing’ under California Law.  Please visit UltraVPN’s cookie policy page to see the list of cookies, cookie notices, or app-specific advertising services to indicate your continued preferences to receive such personalized ads.
9. Age Restrictions
Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. In this context, minors are individuals under the age of 16 except for our identity and credit monitoring services, which are restricted to those under the age of 18. UltraVPN does not knowingly collect personal data from minors or allow them to use our services. If we discover that we have collected personal data from a minor, we may delete such data without notice. Please note that the legal terms under which we make certain services available may require users to be older than 16 years of age.
10. Privacy Policy Updates

Services Privacy Notice
This notice applies to UltraVPN’s VPN services and should be read in conjunction with the
UltraVPN’s Privacy Policy
and it describes data processing practices that may vary from our general Privacy Policy. Where there is an inconsistency between the general Privacy Policy and this notice, this notice prevails.
For ease of reference, in this product privacy notice we use the term “VPN browsing activity” to refer to online activities you conduct via VPN connections initiated with our VPN products. This includes what you are browsing, viewing, or doing online via the VPN connection.
Key Assurances
UltraVPN does not record your VPN browsing activities in any way that can be associated back to you.When you use a VPN connection, we do not store any information that identifies what you browse, view, or do online via that VPN connection. The exception is when you choose to communicate with us (such as via chat or email) over a VPN connection and have chosen to identify yourself to us. While we log what domain names that users visit (but not full URLs), we do not log them in combination with anything that identifies an individual or device.
Data over our VPN connections is encrypted and UltraVPN does not inspect or record the contents of what you are browsing, viewing, or doing through them (unless, of course, you are using the VPN connection to communicate with UltraVPN). For your protection, we may block access to certain resources that are known to be malicious.
What information we do and don’t collect regarding VPN usage
Our VPN products do not log or otherwise record IP addresses, device identifiers, or any other form of identifier in combination with your VPN browsing activity. Simply put, this means that our VPN products do not store any information about what any specific user browsed or accessed through a VPN connection.
When you initiate a VPN connection, we collect your IP address, immediately encrypt it, and delete it at the end of your VPN session. We use this IP address for the purpose of fraud prevention if you submit a payment to us during the VPN session. The IP address is not associated with your VPN browsing activity. This means that we are not able to share your VPN browsing activity with anyone – whether it’s an ad network or government agency – because we simply don’t store that information.
When you access a site through a VPN connection, your IP address appears to that site as the IP address of one of our VPN servers (what we call a “public” IP address). Because those public IP addresses are used by multiple users and we do not record the actual IP addresses of users who use those public IP addresses, we are not able to connect activity originating from a public IP address to activity conducted by any individual user.
Our VPN products log:
device hashes, which are used to identify devices and associate them with other data we collect (such as for measuring bandwidth use, providing support, understanding how you interact with our VPN, and other analytics and marketing purposes). Device hashes are not linked to VPN browsing activity. We use device hashes because we do not require users to register an account to use some of our products and need a way to distinguish between different users and carry out the activities above.
How we use IP Addresses
As written above, we do not log or otherwise record IP addresses in connection with your VPN browsing activity. In the interest of transparency, we do collect and use IP addresses in these other contexts:
protecting against fraud in connection with financial transactions with us
deriving non-identifiable items of information, such as your
approximate
geographic location and information about your internet service provider or carrier (we use this information to provide a better user experience, such as by connecting you with VPN servers nearer to you and by analyzing the connection quality with different internet service providers)
enabling us to attribute our advertisements and service features to actions taken in response to such advertisements and service features
VPN Security
Our VPN servers are hosted with infrastructure providers that do not require us to collect any information about what our users are doing via a VPN connection. If any such provider were to require us to collect such information, we would stop doing business with them and find an alternative provider.
Even if a government agency physically seizes one of our VPN servers and succeeds in breaking disk encryption on those servers, they would not find any logs or information that would reveal what any individual user was browsing, viewing, or doing online via a VPN connection.
