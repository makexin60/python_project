    (1) GDPR, i.e. health data or personal health information (Art. 35 (3) lit. b) GDPR). The processing has not yet
    been commenced. The controller wants to assess what legal bases are available for the processing, the necessity and
    proportionality of the processing and what appropriate safeguards are required for the intended processing
    activities.

B. Context
I. Overview
1. Description of the processing activity
Trividia Health Inc. ("
Trividia
") is the controller of different categories of
    personal data, including personal health information, which is provided by private individuals using Trividia's CGM
    APP, the blood glucose sensor and its transmitter. Trividia operates and offers the CGM APP to private individuals,
    who purchased a blood glucose sensor and a transmitter from one of Trividia's distributors. In order to be able to
    use Trividia's CGM APP, customers must register a user account in the CGM APP and provide personal information such
    as their email address, a user name and an individual password ("
User Account Data
").
    Besides User Account Data and certain technical device data, which are necessary for using the CGM APP, Trividia
    processes in particular personal health information when it comes to the use of the blood glucose sensor, the
    transmitter and the CGM APP. During registration, customers may voluntarily indicate their diabetes type, gender and
    age, while the blood glucose sensor and the transmitter will continuously process and transmit glucose levels to the
    CGM APP via Bluetooth in order to enable customers to view current glucose levels, and to provide them with
    long-term glucose trends and developments based on their glucose levels ("
Health Data
") as
    well as to send warning messages and alerts in case of life-threatening glucose levels. Except for personal data
    such as names and email addresses required for the registration of a user account with the CGM APP, all personal
    data is generally stored on the user's device by default. Any data that is stored locally is not accessible for
    Trividia and its employees. CGM APP users also have the voluntary option to use a cloud service and upload their
    personal data, including their Health Data, to Trividia's cloud servers. If the data is uploaded to the cloud
    server, Trividia intends to share Health Data in an anonymized format with research and development centers,
    external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health authorities in the United States of
    America.
As Trividia processes special categories of personal data referred to in Art. 9 (1) GDPR, i.e. Health
    Data, and because the processing of data concerning health is generally associated with a high risk to the rights
    and freedoms of natural persons, the following DPIA will be limited to this specific category of personal data.
2. What are the purposes of the processing of Health Data?
Trividia processes Health Data and corresponding information for multiple purposes.
a) Monitoring and retrospective analysis of glucose levels, improvement of the understanding and
    control of customers' diabetes and protection of life
The main purpose of the processing of Health Data is the provision of current glucose levels and enabling
    customers to view a retrospective analysis of their glucose levels, which shall be associated with an improvement of
    the understanding and control of their diabetes. In addition to the improvement of the understanding of customers'
    diabetes, Health Data is processed to protect the life of Trividia's customers in case of life-threatening glucose
    levels.
b) Research purposes and improvement of the CGM APP
Trividia additionally intends to process and share Health Data that is voluntarily uploaded to Trividia's cloud
    servers using the cloud service in an anonymized form with research and development centers in the United States of
    America for statistical and analytical research purposes and to improve data related to diabetes research.
    Processing for research purposes includes, but is not limited to, creating, accessing, storing, using, analyzing,
    and sharing the data with affiliates, external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health
    authorities. Anonymized data will also be used to evaluate and improve the performance of the CGM APP and to update
    and improve existing features, develop new features to meet the individual needs of our users, and to improve
    statistical and scientific research capabilities.
3. What is the legal basis for the processing of Health Data?
a) Consent as general basis for processing
The legal basis for Trividia's processing activities in relation to the processing of customers' Health
    Data is their prior express consent pursuant to Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR. Trividia is aware that valid consent
    requires a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or
    she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of its personal data.
    Trividia also understands that the processing of special categories of personal data in the sense of Art. 9 (1) GDPR
    requires explicit consent. Therefore, Trividia will only process customers' Health Data when the customer has
    expressly consented to the processing of his or her personal information for the purposes provided for in Trividia's
    procedures for obtaining informed consent. Conscious of the relevant consent requirements under the GDPR, Trividia
    obtains consent prior to the processing for each and every purpose for which the processing of customer's Health
    Data is intended.
b) Basis for storing Health Data on the device
Already for storing Health Data on the user device (in the default function) Trividia requires users to consent to
    this storage. The user is notified that without this consent, the CGM APP will not be usable with all functions. The
    consent will be requested in the course of the account registration process and requires an active action of the
    user. In this process, the user is also provided with key information regarding the processing and meaning of
    his/her consent.
c) Basis for uploading Health Data to cloud server
On optional basis, the user can upload his/her Health Data to cloud servers operated by third party service
    providers of Trividia. This step requires (theoretical) access to the uploaded data by Trividia and the engaged
    service provider. Uploading the data requires a separate consent in the same form as described above in paragraph
    b).
d) Basis for data sharing with third parties (e.g. research and development centers)
In certain specified cases and when Health Data is uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, Trividia intends to share
    anonymized Health Data with independent third parties. Recipients of Health Data include to the extent necessary
    Trividia's technical and customer support service providers, Trividia Group companies (i.e. affiliate companies),
    research and development centers in the United States of America, external researchers, healthcare companies and
    professionals, and health authorities. In any case, the legal basis for the processing and sharing is the express
    consent of the data subject pursuant to Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR. Consent for sharing personal data also includes
    consent to the act of anonymizing itself. Data sharing requires a separate consent in the same form as described
    above in paragraph b).
e) Basis for international data transfers
To the extent Health Data is processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), Trividia takes
    appropriate measures to provided guarantees that the recipients comply with the main principles of the GDPR. Unless
    there are other appropriate safeguards or transfer mechanisms (such as adequacy decisions of the EU Commission) in
    place, Trividia uses the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c)
    GDPR when drafting the contracts concluded with its service providers and business partners and, in addition,
    obtains the data subject's express consent pursuant to Art. 49 (1) lit. a) GDPR for the third country transfer. The
    consent according to above paragraphs c) and d) include an expressive consent for transfer to third parties outside
    the EEA. This consent is accompanied by information regarding the potential risks for personal data being
    transferred to countries outside the EEA.
4. Which functions of the company are competent for the processing?
The Health Data, uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, is processed by a limited number of personnel. Solely
    authorized employees of Trividia will have access to the serves and the data stored thereon. Authorized employees
    include technical staff who is responsible for the maintenance of the servers. In addition, Trividia's customer
    support team may have access to Health Data, when users of the CGM APP contact the customer support and provide
    information on their Health Data or request support for the CGM APP that potentially requires access to the Health
    Data. These employees and all other employees receive special trainings and information on their, and Trividia's
    privacy, confidentiality and data security information and have to participate in regular privacy and data security
    trainings. In specific cases it may also be required for personnel of hosting service providers to access the Health
    Data stored on their servers for maintenance and trouble-shooting purposes. In the event of customer support
    requests, it may also be necessary for customer support purposes that Health Data is disclosed to Trividia's
    external customer support service provides such as call centers. The service providers are bound by data processing
    agreements meeting the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR and obliged to ensure that their personnel having access to the
    Health Data are trained respectively as well.
5. Have the data subjects been consulted on the processing?
Prior to the start of processing, data subjects have been consulted and informed about Trividia's processing
    activities by receiving the relevant privacy notice. In addition, health data is generally stored locally on the
    data subject's mobile device by default to reduce the risk to individuals' freedoms and rights with respect to their
    personal data. Before the data is uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, the data subject must give consent to the
    upload and, in this regard, will be informed of the relevant processing activities that will be carried out when and
    after the data is uploaded, so that data subjects can make a free and informed decision regarding their personal
    data prior to the processing.
II. Data, processes and assistance
1. Which categories of personal data are processed?
Data concerning health in the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR, namely health data including blood glucose

    outside the EEA or international organizations?
a) Are any data processors involved who get access? If so, are their obligations clearly defined in
    a contract?
When it comes to data processors, Trividia engages and cooperates with certain service providers in order
    to provide the CGM APP and the cloud services. These data processors have been carefully selected beforehand, are
    contractually obligated in the scope of Art. 28 (3) GDPR and have been verified for reliability in accordance with
    Art. 28 (1) GDPR. Data processors engaged by Trividia are basically technical service and host providers. The
    following data processors are involved and carry out processing on behalf of Trividia:
Trividia Health Inc, in the USA (support services)
[call center]
Oracle Cloud ("
ORACLE
") in the EU with physical server location in Germany and
      United Kingdom (as hosting provider)
b) Are there any third parties to whom the data are disclosed? If so, are they joint controllers
    with Trividia or separate controllers?
With the consent of the data subjects Trividia intends to share Health Data in an anonymized form to the extent
    necessary with research and development centers in the United States of America, external researchers, healthcare
    companies and professionals, and health authorities. These recipients are separate controllers, as Trividia will not
    be further involved in the processing and in determining the purposes and means of the processing, or processors
    which have been selected as described in sec.B.II.3.a).
c) Are there any recipients in third countries outside the EEA? If so, what measures are taken to
    ensure a legitimate transfer?
The above recipients of personal data are established outside the EEA or are controlled by a parent company located
    in a third country. When it comes to data sharing with recipients set out in sec. B.II. 3. b), Trividia ensures that
    all data is anonymized prior to the disclosure. In addition, Trividia takes appropriate measures to provide
    guarantees that the recipients comply with the principles of GDPR. Unless there are other appropriate safeguards or
    transfer mechanisms (such as adequacy decisions of the EU Commission) in place, Trividia uses the standard
    contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c) GDPR when drafting the contracts
    concluded with service providers and obtains prior consent for the data transfer from our customers. Before Trividia
    asks customers to consent to the processing and transfer of their personal data, the necessary information according
    to Art. 12, 13 GDPR is provided including information on the risks associated with data transfers to third countries
    that do not have the same level of data protection as the European Union so that they can make an informed decision.
d) What is the life cycle of the data and processes?
Only authorized employees access personal data and Trividia performs daily incremental backups and monthly full
    backups of data stored on the cloud server for data loss prevention purposes. The data is deleted or anonymized as
    soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes it has been collected and processed. The data is basically stored
    for the duration of the contractual relationship regarding the CGM APP. Health Data that is uploaded to Trividia's
    cloud servers will be retained for twelve months from the last use of the customer's user account and deleted or
    aggregated thereafter. If data subjects withdraw their consent or exercise their right to be forgotten under Art. 17
    GDPR, Trividia will delete respective data. Any data that is stored on the mobile device used by the customer in
    conjunction with the use of the CGM APP will be stored locally until the customer decides to delete the CGM APP.
Data that is processed in connection with Trividia's customer service will be stored where this is necessary to
    ensure product safety and to comply with applicable regulatory provisions. The retention period of this information
    may vary between two and ten years after the last sale of the products by distributors.
Trividia also retains data in accordance with retention periods under tax and commercial law, insofar as
    applicable. This does not include Health Data.
In any case, where it is necessary and required by law, Trividia will restrict access to the data and anonymize it
    to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations in order to ensure security of the data and reduce the
    risks to the freedoms and rights of the data subjects.
e) By which technical means are the data being processed and protected?
The data collected by the blood glucose sensor is transmitted via the transmitter to the customer's mobile device on
    which the CGM APP is installed. This transmission adopts the Bluetooth Standard Protocol for encryption. Data that
    remains stored exclusively locally on the customers' mobile device is not accessible for Trividia or its employees
    by remote technical means and encrypted using CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode) encryption. Should customers decide
    to use the cloud service, the data transmission is encrypted by HTTPS encryption. For data encryption on AWS cloud
    servers the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is utilized.
To the extent necessary and requested by the customer, Trividia's customer services teams may have access to the
    customers' data stored on the cloud server. Regardless of the location of the customer service personnel accessing
    the personal information, the access is carried out via a secured network connection.
In terms of data loss prevention and to provide customers with data backups in case of accidental data loss or loss
    of their mobile device, Trividia performs daily incremental backups and monthly full backups of the data stored on
    our cloud servers. For data stored merely locally on customer mobile devices we do not perform data backups.
f) What other measures, guarantees or means are implemented to address the risks and to ensure the
    protection of personal data?
Additional data protection technologies include management of encryption keys, redaction of application layer data,
    and masking of sensitive production data for use in nonproduction environments for testing and development purposes.
C. Basic principles
I. Necessity and proportionality
1. Why is the processing absolutely necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose of the
    processing?
a) Monitoring and retrospective analysis of glucose levels, improvement of the understanding and
    control of customers' diabetes and protection of life
Trividia offers a blood glucose sensor, which allows users to view their current blood glucose levels, monitor their
    diabetes, and improve their understanding of their diabetes through retrospective analysis capabilities in an
    intelligible mobile app. Without the collection, transmission and processing of blood glucose levels stored at least
    locally on the device, the CGM APP and consequently the blood glucose sensor itself would not be usable and would
    not serve the purpose for which they were invented and developed. As a consequence, customers would not be able to
    monitor their current glucose levels and their diabetes. Assumed the data would not be stored locally on the mobile
    device, a retrospective analysis of the customer's glucose levels could not be conducted. Without being able to
    conduct a retrospective analysis, the customers would not be able to improve their understanding of their diabetes,
    and may not be able to improve the quality of their life. In addition, without monitoring current blood glucose
    levels, diabetics could easier fall into hyper- or hypoglycemic blood glucose levels, which can be life-threatening.
    The processing of the corresponding data therefore helps diabetics to recognize life-threatening blood glucose
    ranges and corresponding tendencies at an early stage, to take timely corrective measures and thus to protect their
    lives.
As a risk mitigation measure, Trividia decided to allow the storage of the data locally on the mobile device by
    default, so that users can decide themselves whether they want to upload their data to the cloud servers. Except for
    the users themselves, nobody is able to access the data stored locally on the mobile device. Therefore, it is in the
    sole discretion of the users whether they are willing to increase the risk to their freedom and rights.
Processing, collecting and storing the data merely locally on the mobile device and leaving the decision to upload
    it to Trividia's cloud servers is the least intrusive and processing activity with least risk that can be performed
    to achieve the purposes of the processing and to provide customers with a technology based product. The data is
    obtained through the users themselves and on a voluntary basis, as they are free to purchase other, non-technology
    based products that do not provide for the tech-based features and advantages and therefore process less data.
b) Research purposes and improvement of the CGM APP
Trividia also intends to process the data for research purposes as described in sec. B.I.2.b) by sharing the data
    with recipients named in that section and in sec. B.II.3. Trividia will share the data with third parties only when
    the data is uploaded to the cloud servers, when the customers gave their consent and in an anonymized form. The
    disclosure of data to the specified recipients is necessary so that they can conduct statistical and analytical
    research on diabetes and possibly develop new medications, or at least improve medical knowledge and thus medical
    advice for people with diabetes.
Data masking (also known as data scrambling and data anonymization) is the process of replacing sensitive
    information copied from production databases to test non-production databases with realistic, but scrubbed, data
    based on masking rules. Trividia utilized Oracle Data Masking and Subsetting Pack license to use data masking
    features. For details, please refer to Data Masking and Subsetting Guide.
Since the data will be shared exclusively in an anonymized format that does not allow the identification of data
    subjects, and only when the CGM APP user gives his or her explicit consent, the processing is the least intrusive,
    and is also based on the explicit expressed wishes of the users. The same applies for the processing for the
    improvement of the CGM APP. The data is solely used for this purpose when it is uploaded to the cloud server with
    the users consent and in an anonymized format.
Less intrusive and risky means than using anonymized data and following a consent based approach are not available,
    so that the selected means of processing are the most privacy friendly and proportionate available to achieve these
    purposes.
2. How does Trividia ensure that the data is correct?
The data is collected directly from the data subjects through a sensor which is self-applied to their
    skin. Trividia has no influence on the stored data.
In operation, the CGM System uses an integrated transmitter to convert electric signals to digital signals
    (following a process of signal amplification and filtering) and relay the data to the user's Bluetooth 4.0 (and
    later) smartphone using the Bluetooth LE connectivity provided by the Nordic SoC. The processor with floating point
    unit (FPU) provides ample computational power to run the complex sensor algorithms that ensure correct conversion
    the sensor data from the transmitter into the blood glucose value displayed on the companion APP.
3. What is the storage duration of the data?
See B.II.3.d).
II. Compliance with data subject rights
1. How are the data subjects informed about the processing?
Data subjects are informed about the processing through the provision of Trividia's privacy notice which contain the
    relevant information according to Art. 13 GDPR. The privacy notice is provided when registering an account in the
    CGM APP. Users must confirm acknowledgment of the privacy notice during the registration process.
2. How can data subjects exercise their right of access?
Data subjects using the CGM APP may contact the data protection officer and request access to their personal
    information. Data stored on the device of the data subject can be viewed at any time on the device.
3. How can data subjects exercise their right of erasure (deletion) / restriction of processing?
For data that is stored on the cloud server, the data subject can exercise his or her right of erasure by contacting
    the data protection officer and request deletion of the data. In addition, any data stored on the cloud server will
    be deleted or aggregated after a period of twelve months from the last use of the respective user account.
With respect to the data stored locally on the customer's mobile device, the data subject can easily delete the data
    at any time by removing the CGM APP from his or her mobile device.
4. How can data subjects exercise their right to rectification?
If data subjects believe that data processed by the company and stored on the cloud server is incorrect, they can
    contact the companyâs data protection officer. User Account Data can be rectified by the user at any time in the CGM
    APP.
5. How can data subjects exercise their right to object?
There will be no use case to exercise the right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR, because the relevant data is not
    processed on the basis of Trividia's legitimate interest, not for the purpose of direct marketing and not for
    scientific, historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) GDPR.
6. How can data subjects exercise their right to data portability?
The users have a right to request the transfer of their personal information in certain circumstances. This includes
    data Trividia process in an automated way in the APP based on user's consent.

III. Additional measures to lower the risk (controls)
1. Risk of unauthorized processing of the data, i.e. of unauthorized access and disclosure of the
    data, by authorized or unauthorized employees or third parties
Both, authorized and unauthorized personnel will receive special trainings on privacy laws and will be made aware of
    data protection laws, basic requirements, consequences of data protection violations and their impact on the
    controller as well as the data subjects and their data protection rights.
Trividia or its employees cannot access data stored locally on the mobile device of the customer. Should the
    customer decide for Trividia's cloud service and upload his or her personal data to Trividia's cloud servers, solely
    authorized employees will have access to the servers and personal data stored thereon and only on a âneed-to-knowâ
    basis. Such personal will receive the aforementioned training on privacy laws. Access by any other personnel is
    prevented by logical access restriction and specifying an access control list ("
ACL
")
    blocks all IP addresses that are not in the ACL list from accessing the database.
In addition, Trividia retains data associated with user's CGM APP account and stored on a cloud server for a period
    of 12 months following the last use of the account. Customer support requests will be retained, where this is
    necessary, to ensure product safety and to comply with applicable regulatory provisions.
As soon as the data is no longer necessary for the purposes collected and processed or if the customer exercise
    their right to be forgotten, withdraw their consent, Trividia deletes or anonymizes such personal data.
2. Risk of unauthorized access to the data stored locally on the customer's mobile device in the
    event of a loss of the device
Data stored locally on the users mobile device is encrypted using CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode) encryption. Using
    CBC encryption has the advantage that plaintext patterns will be destroyed, identical plaintext patterns and blocks
    have different cipher texts, different cyber attacks such as time memory tradeoff and plaintext attacks become more
    difficult and reordering of the cipher text blocks result in erroneous plaintext blocks. The CGM APP is additionally
    protected against unauthorized access by security measures such as password prompt each time the App is launched and
    automatically sign out when the user closes the App.
These means protect data that is stored locally in an adequate and state of the art manner.
3. Risk of unauthorized access to and interception of the personal data during transmission from
    the transmitter to the mobile device and during the upload to the cloud server
The transmission from the glucose level transmitter to the CGM APP adopts the Bluetooth Standard Protocol for
    encryption. Establishing a connection basically requires authentication, authorization and a so called âpairingâ
    between the devices. In order to establish the connection and pair the devices, the CGM APP user needs to enter a
    specific pin code, which can be set individually by the user.
The Bluetooth Standard Protocol in conjunction with the authentication, authorization and "pairing" requirements is
    technically sufficient and state of the art to protect the transmitted data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. Risks arising from the third country transfer when using the cloud service
When customers voluntarily decide to opt for Trividia's cloud service and upload their data to Trividia's cloud
    servers provided by AWS, the data transfer from the mobile device to the cloud server is encrypted using HTTPS
    encryption. HTTPS encryption is the standard communication protocol in the internet and represents a transport
    encryption, which shall ensure a tap-proof transfer of data in the internet between the client (sender) and the
    server (recipient).
When the data is stored on the cloud server, it is encrypted by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a highly secure
    encryption method adopted by the U.S. Government to protect non-classified data and classified information up to Top
    Secret level, given that a key with a length of 192 or 256 bits is used. At present, there exists no known practical
    attack that would allow unauthorized persons to decrypt and read data encrypted by AES without the knowledge of the
    key, so that the risks associated with the upload of the data is reduced to a minimum. The encryption ensures that
    third parties cannot access and read the data without the knowledge of the encryption key.
When it comes to third country transfers in the meaning of Art. 44 et. seq. GDPR, Trividia takes appropriate
    measures to provide guarantees that the recipients comply with the principles of GDPR and inform data subjects in
    the privacy notice about the risks associated with third country transfers where no adequacy decision of the
    European Commission exists, so that data subjects can make an informed decision regarding the processing of their
    data. As a risk mitigation measure, third country transfers may only occur if data subjects actively decide to
    upload their data to Trividia's cloud server, i.e. Trividia's customer must actively opt in for the upload of their
    data and give their express consent for the upload. This upload function is disabled in the default setting of the
    CGM APP. When no other appropriate safeguards or transfer tools for the third country transfer are in place,
    Trividia uses the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c) GDPR
    when drafting contracts concluded with its service providers, so that these business partners are contractually
    obliged to adhere to the principles of the GDPR. Therefore, the risk associated with third country transfers and
    using Trividia's cloud service is low and Trividia implemented countermeasures to ensure the security and integrity
    of users' Health Data.
5. Risk of unauthorized access to personal data in the case of provision of customer data to
    research and development centers, external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health
    authorities for research purposes
Data of data subjects will only be provided to these recipients if the customer has chosen to upload his or her data
    to the cloud server and consented to the sharing of the uploaded data with the aforementioned recipients. To avoid
    an unauthorized access to or an unlawful disclosure of the personal data, Trividia solely shares anonymized data
    with these recipients. By anonymizing the shared data as described under C.I.1.b), Trividia ensures that its
    customers remain unidentifiable and that the data cannot be de-anonymized by the recipients.
6. Risk of data loss due to data incidents, employee errors or cloud server defects
Storing data on electronic devices or on cloud servers always bears the risk that data is lost due to data
    incidents, loss of the device itself, employee errors or defects of the cloud server. In order to prevent the loss
    of user data, Trividia has set up various processes to secure and backup user data. For data stored exclusively on
    the customer's mobile device, Trividia has integrated an upload option into the CGM APP that allows CGM APP users to
    upload the data to Trividia's cloud servers by using the cloud service. If the users lose their mobile device or if
    it breaks, the data can be easily retrieved from the cloud server and transferred to a new device by using the
    appropriate user account and logging in. The relevant data is then available again in the CGM APP.
Data stored on the cloud server, is secured against data loss through daily incremental backups and monthly full
    backups, which allow Trividia to provide the user with backups of their data in cases of accidental data loss, data
    incidents, employee errors or cloud server defects. These backups are stored on a separate server, which is
    independent from the main cloud server, so that backups would not be affected by any data incidents, employee errors
    or cloud server defects. In addition, Trividia utilizes Oracle Object Storage feature to prevent data loss, any loss
    in data redundancy is automatically detected and self-healed, without any customer impact.
IV. General Risk Assessment Summary
The risks for the rights and freedoms of Trividia's customers and users of the CGM APP in connection with the blood
    glucose sensor and the transmitter and Trividia's cloud service in relation to the purposes of the processing and
    specific processing activities of Trividia are acceptable. Although the processing of special categories of personal
    data, i.e. Health Data, and hence very sensitive data, always incurs material risks for the rights and freedoms of
    data subjects, Trividia has implemented effective risk mitigation and counter measures to reduce the risks
    associated with the processing of such data to reach the corresponding purposes. These measures include, among
    others, data access restriction to relevant personnel, offering a cloud service and performing regular backups of
    user data to prevent data loss, using specific and different high-quality and secure encryption technologies when
    transferring and storing user data, and contractual instruments when drafting and concluding agreements with
    business partners located in third countries to provide sufficient and appropriate guarantees for transfers to these
    third countries.
In conclusion, Trividia comes to the assessment that no high or inacceptable risks for data subjects result from the
    processing of Health Data in the manner performed by Trividia.

    (1) GDPR, i.e. health data or personal health information (Art. 35 (3) lit. b) GDPR). The processing has not yet
    been commenced. The controller wants to assess what legal bases are available for the processing, the necessity and
    proportionality of the processing and what appropriate safeguards are required for the intended processing
    activities.
III. Annexes and references

    other privacy/compliance documentation.]
IV. Date for the next review
[Complete when draft is final, max. 1 year from approval]
B. Context
I. Overview
1. Description of the processing activity
Trividia Health Inc. ("
Trividia
") is the controller of different categories of
    personal data, including personal health information, which is provided by private individuals using Trividia's CGM
    APP, the blood glucose sensor and its transmitter. Trividia operates and offers the CGM APP to private individuals,
    who purchased a blood glucose sensor and a transmitter from one of Trividia's distributors. In order to be able to
    use Trividia's CGM APP, customers must register a user account in the CGM APP and provide personal information such
    as their email address, a user name and an individual password ("
User Account Data
").
    Besides User Account Data and certain technical device data, which are necessary for using the CGM APP, Trividia
    processes in particular personal health information when it comes to the use of the blood glucose sensor, the
    transmitter and the CGM APP. During registration, customers may voluntarily indicate their diabetes type, gender and
    age, while the blood glucose sensor and the transmitter will continuously process and transmit glucose levels to the
    CGM APP via Bluetooth in order to enable customers to view current glucose levels, and to provide them with
    long-term glucose trends and developments based on their glucose levels ("
Health Data
") as
    well as to send warning messages and alerts in case of life-threatening glucose levels. Except for personal data
    such as names and email addresses required for the registration of a user account with the CGM APP, all personal
    data is generally stored on the user's device by default. Any data that is stored locally is not accessible for
    Trividia and its employees. CGM APP users also have the voluntary option to use a cloud service and upload their
    personal data, including their Health Data, to Trividia's cloud servers. If the data is uploaded to the cloud
    server, Trividia intends to share Health Data in an anonymized format with research and development centers,
    external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health authorities in the United States of
    America.
As Trividia processes special categories of personal data referred to in Art. 9 (1) GDPR, i.e. Health
    Data, and because the processing of data concerning health is generally associated with a high risk to the rights
    and freedoms of natural persons, the following DPIA will be limited to this specific category of personal data.
2. What are the purposes of the processing of Health Data?
Trividia processes Health Data and corresponding information for multiple purposes.
a) Monitoring and retrospective analysis of glucose levels, improvement of the understanding and
    control of customers' diabetes and protection of life
The main purpose of the processing of Health Data is the provision of current glucose levels and enabling
    customers to view a retrospective analysis of their glucose levels, which shall be associated with an improvement of
    the understanding and control of their diabetes. In addition to the improvement of the understanding of customers'
    diabetes, Health Data is processed to protect the life of Trividia's customers in case of life-threatening glucose
    levels.
b) Research purposes and improvement of the CGM APP
Trividia additionally intends to process and share Health Data that is voluntarily uploaded to Trividia's cloud
    servers using the cloud service in an anonymized form with research and development centers in the United States of
    America for statistical and analytical research purposes and to improve data related to diabetes research.
    Processing for research purposes includes, but is not limited to, creating, accessing, storing, using, analyzing,
    and sharing the data with affiliates, external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health
    authorities. Anonymized data will also be used to evaluate and improve the performance of the CGM APP and to update
    and improve existing features, develop new features to meet the individual needs of our users, and to improve
    statistical and scientific research capabilities.
3. What is the legal basis for the processing of Health Data?
a) Consent as general basis for processing
The legal basis for Trividia's processing activities in relation to the processing of customers' Health
    Data is their prior express consent pursuant to Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR. Trividia is aware that valid consent
    requires a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or
    she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of its personal data.
    Trividia also understands that the processing of special categories of personal data in the sense of Art. 9 (1) GDPR
    requires explicit consent. Therefore, Trividia will only process customers' Health Data when the customer has
    expressly consented to the processing of his or her personal information for the purposes provided for in Trividia's
    procedures for obtaining informed consent. Conscious of the relevant consent requirements under the GDPR, Trividia
    obtains consent prior to the processing for each and every purpose for which the processing of customer's Health
    Data is intended.
b) Basis for storing Health Data on the device
Already for storing Health Data on the user device (in the default function) Trividia requires users to consent to
    this storage. The user is notified that without this consent, the CGM APP will not be usable with all functions. The
    consent will be requested in the course of the account registration process and requires an active action of the
    user. In this process, the user is also provided with key information regarding the processing and meaning of
    his/her consent.
c) Basis for uploading Health Data to cloud server
On optional basis, the user can upload his/her Health Data to cloud servers operated by third party service
    providers of Trividia. This step requires (theoretical) access to the uploaded data by Trividia and the engaged
    service provider. Uploading the data requires a separate consent in the same form as described above in paragraph
    b).
d) Basis for data sharing with third parties (e.g. research and development centers)
In certain specified cases and when Health Data is uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, Trividia intends to share
    anonymized Health Data with independent third parties. Recipients of Health Data include to the extent necessary
    Trividia's technical and customer support service providers, Trividia Group companies (i.e. affiliate companies),
    research and development centers in the United States of America, external researchers, healthcare companies and
    professionals, and health authorities. In any case, the legal basis for the processing and sharing is the express
    consent of the data subject pursuant to Art. 9 (2) lit. a) GDPR. Consent for sharing personal data also includes
    consent to the act of anonymizing itself. Data sharing requires a separate consent in the same form as described
    above in paragraph b).
e) Basis for international data transfers
To the extent Health Data is processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), Trividia takes
    appropriate measures to provided guarantees that the recipients comply with the main principles of the GDPR. Unless
    there are other appropriate safeguards or transfer mechanisms (such as adequacy decisions of the EU Commission) in
    place, Trividia uses the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c)
    GDPR when drafting the contracts concluded with its service providers and business partners and, in addition,
    obtains the data subject's express consent pursuant to Art. 49 (1) lit. a) GDPR for the third country transfer. The
    consent according to above paragraphs c) and d) include an expressive consent for transfer to third parties outside
    the EEA. This consent is accompanied by information regarding the potential risks for personal data being
    transferred to countries outside the EEA.
4. Which functions of the company are competent for the processing?
The Health Data, uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, is processed by a limited number of personnel. Solely
    authorized employees of Trividia will have access to the serves and the data stored thereon. Authorized employees
    include technical staff who is responsible for the maintenance of the servers. In addition, Trividia's customer
    support team may have access to Health Data, when users of the CGM APP contact the customer support and provide
    information on their Health Data or request support for the CGM APP that potentially requires access to the Health
    Data. These employees and all other employees receive special trainings and information on their, and Trividia's
    privacy, confidentiality and data security information and have to participate in regular privacy and data security
    trainings. In specific cases it may also be required for personnel of hosting service providers to access the Health
    Data stored on their servers for maintenance and trouble-shooting purposes. In the event of customer support
    requests, it may also be necessary for customer support purposes that Health Data is disclosed to Trividia's
    external customer support service provides such as call centers. The service providers are bound by data processing
    agreements meeting the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR and obliged to ensure that their personnel having access to the
    Health Data are trained respectively as well.
5. Have the data subjects been consulted on the processing?
Prior to the start of processing, data subjects have been consulted and informed about Trividia's processing
    activities by receiving the relevant privacy notice. In addition, health data is generally stored locally on the
    data subject's mobile device by default to reduce the risk to individuals' freedoms and rights with respect to their
    personal data. Before the data is uploaded to Trividia's cloud servers, the data subject must give consent to the
    upload and, in this regard, will be informed of the relevant processing activities that will be carried out when and
    after the data is uploaded, so that data subjects can make a free and informed decision regarding their personal
    data prior to the processing.
II. Data, processes and assistance
1. Which categories of personal data are processed?
Data concerning health in the meaning of Art. 9 (1) GDPR, namely health data including blood glucose
    levels.
2. Which categories of persons are concerned by the processing?
Private individuals who suffer from diabetes having purchased or ordered the Trividia blood glucose
    sensor and transmitter from Trividia distributors, and have registered with the CGM APP.
3. Who are the recipients to whom the data are disclosed, including recipients in third countries
    outside the EEA or international organizations?
a) Are any data processors involved who get access? If so, are their obligations clearly defined in
    a contract?
When it comes to data processors, Trividia engages and cooperates with certain service providers in order
    to provide the CGM APP and the cloud services. These data processors have been carefully selected beforehand, are
    contractually obligated in the scope of Art. 28 (3) GDPR and have been verified for reliability in accordance with
    Art. 28 (1) GDPR. Data processors engaged by Trividia are basically technical service and host providers. The
    following data processors are involved and carry out processing on behalf of Trividia:
Trividia Health Inc, in the USA (support services)
[call center]
Oracle Cloud ("
ORACLE
") in the EU with physical server location in Germany and
      United Kingdom (as hosting provider)
b) Are there any third parties to whom the data are disclosed? If so, are they joint controllers
    with Trividia or separate controllers?
With the consent of the data subjects Trividia intends to share Health Data in an anonymized form to the extent
    necessary with research and development centers in the United States of America, external researchers, healthcare
    companies and professionals, and health authorities. These recipients are separate controllers, as Trividia will not
    be further involved in the processing and in determining the purposes and means of the processing, or processors
    which have been selected as described in sec.B.II.3.a).
c) Are there any recipients in third countries outside the EEA? If so, what measures are taken to
    ensure a legitimate transfer?
The above recipients of personal data are established outside the EEA or are controlled by a parent company located
    in a third country. When it comes to data sharing with recipients set out in sec. B.II. 3. b), Trividia ensures that
    all data is anonymized prior to the disclosure. In addition, Trividia takes appropriate measures to provide
    guarantees that the recipients comply with the principles of GDPR. Unless there are other appropriate safeguards or
    transfer mechanisms (such as adequacy decisions of the EU Commission) in place, Trividia uses the standard
    contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c) GDPR when drafting the contracts
    concluded with service providers and obtains prior consent for the data transfer from our customers. Before Trividia
    asks customers to consent to the processing and transfer of their personal data, the necessary information according
    to Art. 12, 13 GDPR is provided including information on the risks associated with data transfers to third countries
    that do not have the same level of data protection as the European Union so that they can make an informed decision.
d) What is the life cycle of the data and processes?
Only authorized employees access personal data and Trividia performs daily incremental backups and monthly full
    backups of data stored on the cloud server for data loss prevention purposes. The data is deleted or anonymized as
    soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes it has been collected and processed. The data is basically stored
    for the duration of the contractual relationship regarding the CGM APP. Health Data that is uploaded to Trividia's
    cloud servers will be retained for twelve months from the last use of the customer's user account and deleted or
    aggregated thereafter. If data subjects withdraw their consent or exercise their right to be forgotten under Art. 17
    GDPR, Trividia will delete respective data. Any data that is stored on the mobile device used by the customer in
    conjunction with the use of the CGM APP will be stored locally until the customer decides to delete the CGM APP.
Data that is processed in connection with Trividia's customer service will be stored where this is necessary to
    ensure product safety and to comply with applicable regulatory provisions. The retention period of this information
    may vary between two and ten years after the last sale of the products by distributors.
Trividia also retains data in accordance with retention periods under tax and commercial law, insofar as
    applicable. This does not include Health Data.
In any case, where it is necessary and required by law, Trividia will restrict access to the data and anonymize it
    to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations in order to ensure security of the data and reduce the
    risks to the freedoms and rights of the data subjects.
e) By which technical means are the data being processed and protected?
The data collected by the blood glucose sensor is transmitted via the transmitter to the customer's mobile device on
    which the CGM APP is installed. This transmission adopts the Bluetooth Standard Protocol for encryption. Data that
    remains stored exclusively locally on the customers' mobile device is not accessible for Trividia or its employees
    by remote technical means and encrypted using CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode) encryption. Should customers decide
    to use the cloud service, the data transmission is encrypted by HTTPS encryption. For data encryption on AWS cloud
    servers the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is utilized.
To the extent necessary and requested by the customer, Trividia's customer services teams may have access to the
    customers' data stored on the cloud server. Regardless of the location of the customer service personnel accessing
    the personal information, the access is carried out via a secured network connection.
In terms of data loss prevention and to provide customers with data backups in case of accidental data loss or loss
    of their mobile device, Trividia performs daily incremental backups and monthly full backups of the data stored on
    our cloud servers. For data stored merely locally on customer mobile devices we do not perform data backups.
f) What other measures, guarantees or means are implemented to address the risks and to ensure the
    protection of personal data?
Additional data protection technologies include management of encryption keys, redaction of application layer data,
    and masking of sensitive production data for use in nonproduction environments for testing and development purposes.
C. Basic principles
I. Necessity and proportionality
1. Why is the processing absolutely necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose of the
    processing?
a) Monitoring and retrospective analysis of glucose levels, improvement of the understanding and
    control of customers' diabetes and protection of life
Trividia offers a blood glucose sensor, which allows users to view their current blood glucose levels, monitor their
    diabetes, and improve their understanding of their diabetes through retrospective analysis capabilities in an
    intelligible mobile app. Without the collection, transmission and processing of blood glucose levels stored at least
    locally on the device, the CGM APP and consequently the blood glucose sensor itself would not be usable and would
    not serve the purpose for which they were invented and developed. As a consequence, customers would not be able to
    monitor their current glucose levels and their diabetes. Assumed the data would not be stored locally on the mobile
    device, a retrospective analysis of the customer's glucose levels could not be conducted. Without being able to
    conduct a retrospective analysis, the customers would not be able to improve their understanding of their diabetes,
    and may not be able to improve the quality of their life. In addition, without monitoring current blood glucose
    levels, diabetics could easier fall into hyper- or hypoglycemic blood glucose levels, which can be life-threatening.
    The processing of the corresponding data therefore helps diabetics to recognize life-threatening blood glucose
    ranges and corresponding tendencies at an early stage, to take timely corrective measures and thus to protect their
    lives.
As a risk mitigation measure, Trividia decided to allow the storage of the data locally on the mobile device by
    default, so that users can decide themselves whether they want to upload their data to the cloud servers. Except for
    the users themselves, nobody is able to access the data stored locally on the mobile device. Therefore, it is in the
    sole discretion of the users whether they are willing to increase the risk to their freedom and rights.
Processing, collecting and storing the data merely locally on the mobile device and leaving the decision to upload
    it to Trividia's cloud servers is the least intrusive and processing activity with least risk that can be performed
    to achieve the purposes of the processing and to provide customers with a technology based product. The data is
    obtained through the users themselves and on a voluntary basis, as they are free to purchase other, non-technology
    based products that do not provide for the tech-based features and advantages and therefore process less data.
b) Research purposes and improvement of the CGM APP
Trividia also intends to process the data for research purposes as described in sec. B.I.2.b) by sharing the data
    with recipients named in that section and in sec. B.II.3. Trividia will share the data with third parties only when
    the data is uploaded to the cloud servers, when the customers gave their consent and in an anonymized form. The
    disclosure of data to the specified recipients is necessary so that they can conduct statistical and analytical
    research on diabetes and possibly develop new medications, or at least improve medical knowledge and thus medical
    advice for people with diabetes.
Data masking (also known as data scrambling and data anonymization) is the process of replacing sensitive
    information copied from production databases to test non-production databases with realistic, but scrubbed, data
    based on masking rules. Trividia utilized Oracle Data Masking and Subsetting Pack license to use data masking
    features. For details, please refer to Data Masking and Subsetting Guide.
Since the data will be shared exclusively in an anonymized format that does not allow the identification of data
    subjects, and only when the CGM APP user gives his or her explicit consent, the processing is the least intrusive,
    and is also based on the explicit expressed wishes of the users. The same applies for the processing for the
    improvement of the CGM APP. The data is solely used for this purpose when it is uploaded to the cloud server with
    the users consent and in an anonymized format.
Less intrusive and risky means than using anonymized data and following a consent based approach are not available,
    so that the selected means of processing are the most privacy friendly and proportionate available to achieve these
    purposes.
2. How does Trividia ensure that the data is correct?
The data is collected directly from the data subjects through a sensor which is self-applied to their
    skin. Trividia has no influence on the stored data.
In operation, the CGM System uses an integrated transmitter to convert electric signals to digital signals
    (following a process of signal amplification and filtering) and relay the data to the user's Bluetooth 4.0 (and
    later) smartphone using the Bluetooth LE connectivity provided by the Nordic SoC. The processor with floating point
    unit (FPU) provides ample computational power to run the complex sensor algorithms that ensure correct conversion
    the sensor data from the transmitter into the blood glucose value displayed on the companion APP.
3. What is the storage duration of the data?
See B.II.3.d).
II. Compliance with data subject rights
1. How are the data subjects informed about the processing?
Data subjects are informed about the processing through the provision of Trividia's privacy notice which contain the
    relevant information according to Art. 13 GDPR. The privacy notice is provided when registering an account in the
    CGM APP. Users must confirm acknowledgment of the privacy notice during the registration process.
2. How can data subjects exercise their right of access?
Data subjects using the CGM APP may contact the data protection officer and request access to their personal
    information. Data stored on the device of the data subject can be viewed at any time on the device.
3. How can data subjects exercise their right of erasure (deletion) / restriction of processing?
For data that is stored on the cloud server, the data subject can exercise his or her right of erasure by contacting
    the data protection officer and request deletion of the data. In addition, any data stored on the cloud server will
    be deleted or aggregated after a period of twelve months from the last use of the respective user account.
With respect to the data stored locally on the customer's mobile device, the data subject can easily delete the data
    at any time by removing the CGM APP from his or her mobile device.
4. How can data subjects exercise their right to rectification?
If data subjects believe that data processed by the company and stored on the cloud server is incorrect, they can
    contact the companyâs data protection officer. User Account Data can be rectified by the user at any time in the CGM
    APP.
5. How can data subjects exercise their right to object?
There will be no use case to exercise the right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR, because the relevant data is not
    processed on the basis of Trividia's legitimate interest, not for the purpose of direct marketing and not for
    scientific, historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) GDPR.
6. How can data subjects exercise their right to data portability?
The users have a right to request the transfer of their personal information in certain circumstances. This includes
    data Trividia process in an automated way in the APP based on user's consent.

III. Additional measures to lower the risk (controls)
1. Risk of unauthorized processing of the data, i.e. of unauthorized access and disclosure of the
    data, by authorized or unauthorized employees or third parties
Both, authorized and unauthorized personnel will receive special trainings on privacy laws and will be made aware of
    data protection laws, basic requirements, consequences of data protection violations and their impact on the
    controller as well as the data subjects and their data protection rights.
Trividia or its employees cannot access data stored locally on the mobile device of the customer. Should the
    customer decide for Trividia's cloud service and upload his or her personal data to Trividia's cloud servers, solely
    authorized employees will have access to the servers and personal data stored thereon and only on a âneed-to-knowâ
    basis. Such personal will receive the aforementioned training on privacy laws. Access by any other personnel is
    prevented by logical access restriction and specifying an access control list ("
ACL
")
    blocks all IP addresses that are not in the ACL list from accessing the database.
In addition, Trividia retains data associated with user's CGM APP account and stored on a cloud server for a period
    of 12 months following the last use of the account. Customer support requests will be retained, where this is
    necessary, to ensure product safety and to comply with applicable regulatory provisions.
As soon as the data is no longer necessary for the purposes collected and processed or if the customer exercise
    their right to be forgotten, withdraw their consent, Trividia deletes or anonymizes such personal data.
2. Risk of unauthorized access to the data stored locally on the customer's mobile device in the
    event of a loss of the device
Data stored locally on the users mobile device is encrypted using CBC (Cipher Block Chaining Mode) encryption. Using
    CBC encryption has the advantage that plaintext patterns will be destroyed, identical plaintext patterns and blocks
    have different cipher texts, different cyber attacks such as time memory tradeoff and plaintext attacks become more
    difficult and reordering of the cipher text blocks result in erroneous plaintext blocks. The CGM APP is additionally
    protected against unauthorized access by security measures such as password prompt each time the App is launched and
    automatically sign out when the user closes the App.
These means protect data that is stored locally in an adequate and state of the art manner.
3. Risk of unauthorized access to and interception of the personal data during transmission from
    the transmitter to the mobile device and during the upload to the cloud server
The transmission from the glucose level transmitter to the CGM APP adopts the Bluetooth Standard Protocol for
    encryption. Establishing a connection basically requires authentication, authorization and a so called âpairingâ
    between the devices. In order to establish the connection and pair the devices, the CGM APP user needs to enter a
    specific pin code, which can be set individually by the user.
The Bluetooth Standard Protocol in conjunction with the authentication, authorization and "pairing" requirements is
    technically sufficient and state of the art to protect the transmitted data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. Risks arising from the third country transfer when using the cloud service
When customers voluntarily decide to opt for Trividia's cloud service and upload their data to Trividia's cloud
    servers provided by AWS, the data transfer from the mobile device to the cloud server is encrypted using HTTPS
    encryption. HTTPS encryption is the standard communication protocol in the internet and represents a transport
    encryption, which shall ensure a tap-proof transfer of data in the internet between the client (sender) and the
    server (recipient).
When the data is stored on the cloud server, it is encrypted by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a highly secure
    encryption method adopted by the U.S. Government to protect non-classified data and classified information up to Top
    Secret level, given that a key with a length of 192 or 256 bits is used. At present, there exists no known practical
    attack that would allow unauthorized persons to decrypt and read data encrypted by AES without the knowledge of the
    key, so that the risks associated with the upload of the data is reduced to a minimum. The encryption ensures that
    third parties cannot access and read the data without the knowledge of the encryption key.
When it comes to third country transfers in the meaning of Art. 44 et. seq. GDPR, Trividia takes appropriate
    measures to provide guarantees that the recipients comply with the principles of GDPR and inform data subjects in
    the privacy notice about the risks associated with third country transfers where no adequacy decision of the
    European Commission exists, so that data subjects can make an informed decision regarding the processing of their
    data. As a risk mitigation measure, third country transfers may only occur if data subjects actively decide to
    upload their data to Trividia's cloud server, i.e. Trividia's customer must actively opt in for the upload of their
    data and give their express consent for the upload. This upload function is disabled in the default setting of the
    CGM APP. When no other appropriate safeguards or transfer tools for the third country transfer are in place,
    Trividia uses the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 46 (2) lit. c) GDPR
    when drafting contracts concluded with its service providers, so that these business partners are contractually
    obliged to adhere to the principles of the GDPR. Therefore, the risk associated with third country transfers and
    using Trividia's cloud service is low and Trividia implemented countermeasures to ensure the security and integrity
    of users' Health Data.
5. Risk of unauthorized access to personal data in the case of provision of customer data to
    research and development centers, external researchers, healthcare companies and professionals, and health
    authorities for research purposes
Data of data subjects will only be provided to these recipients if the customer has chosen to upload his or her data
    to the cloud server and consented to the sharing of the uploaded data with the aforementioned recipients. To avoid
    an unauthorized access to or an unlawful disclosure of the personal data, Trividia solely shares anonymized data
    with these recipients. By anonymizing the shared data as described under C.I.1.b), Trividia ensures that its
    customers remain unidentifiable and that the data cannot be de-anonymized by the recipients.
6. Risk of data loss due to data incidents, employee errors or cloud server defects
Storing data on electronic devices or on cloud servers always bears the risk that data is lost due to data
    incidents, loss of the device itself, employee errors or defects of the cloud server. In order to prevent the loss
    of user data, Trividia has set up various processes to secure and backup user data. For data stored exclusively on
    the customer's mobile device, Trividia has integrated an upload option into the CGM APP that allows CGM APP users to
    upload the data to Trividia's cloud servers by using the cloud service. If the users lose their mobile device or if
    it breaks, the data can be easily retrieved from the cloud server and transferred to a new device by using the
    appropriate user account and logging in. The relevant data is then available again in the CGM APP.
Data stored on the cloud server, is secured against data loss through daily incremental backups and monthly full
    backups, which allow Trividia to provide the user with backups of their data in cases of accidental data loss, data
    incidents, employee errors or cloud server defects. These backups are stored on a separate server, which is
    independent from the main cloud server, so that backups would not be affected by any data incidents, employee errors
    or cloud server defects. In addition, Trividia utilizes Oracle Object Storage feature to prevent data loss, any loss
    in data redundancy is automatically detected and self-healed, without any customer impact.
IV. General Risk Assessment Summary
The risks for the rights and freedoms of Trividia's customers and users of the CGM APP in connection with the blood
    glucose sensor and the transmitter and Trividia's cloud service in relation to the purposes of the processing and
    specific processing activities of Trividia are acceptable. Although the processing of special categories of personal
    data, i.e. Health Data, and hence very sensitive data, always incurs material risks for the rights and freedoms of
    data subjects, Trividia has implemented effective risk mitigation and counter measures to reduce the risks
    associated with the processing of such data to reach the corresponding purposes. These measures include, among
    others, data access restriction to relevant personnel, offering a cloud service and performing regular backups of
    user data to prevent data loss, using specific and different high-quality and secure encryption technologies when
    transferring and storing user data, and contractual instruments when drafting and concluding agreements with
    business partners located in third countries to provide sufficient and appropriate guarantees for transfers to these
    third countries.
In conclusion, Trividia comes to the assessment that no high or inacceptable risks for data subjects result from the
    processing of Health Data in the manner performed by Trividia.

At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights â and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
Thatâs why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as âpersonal data,â no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you â such as your name â is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you â such as the serial number of your device â is personal data. Aggregated data is considered nonâpersonal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, âAppleâ) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Appleâs Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Appleâs behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at

To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request â for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.

To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; itâs also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law â for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once theyâve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as âsaleâ is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not âshareâ your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep childrenâs personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
childâs educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles childrenâs personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called âManaged Apple IDs.â These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a childâs personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your childâs information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Appleâs websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
âcookiesâ and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Appleâs systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and youâre using the Safari web browser, choose âBlock all cookiesâ in Safariâs privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a âclick-through URLâ that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Appleâs advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Appleâs advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world,
including Apple-affiliated companies, to perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live.
For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service.

Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Appleâs international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by
Standard Contractual Clauses
. If you have questions or would like a copy of Appleâs Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at

Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures.
Appleâs privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites and devices, such as Search, YouTube and Google Home
Platforms such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content such as emails and photos, or to see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when youâre signed out or without creating an account at all; for example, searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, weâve added examples, explanatory videos and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information that Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users â from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads youâll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When youâre not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information that we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application or
device
that youâre using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When youâre signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things that you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you arenât signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information â like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content that you create, upload or receive from others when using our services. This includes things such as email you write and receive, photos and videos that you save, docs and spreadsheets you create and comments that you make on YouTube videos.
Information that we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers and
devices
that you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features such as automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information that we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including operator name and phone number and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time and referrer URL of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers â for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If youâre using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and operator name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how youâre using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video that you might like. The activity information that we collect may include:
Terms that you search for
Videos that you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history that youâve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information thatâs saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products that youâre using and the settings that you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products that you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
; for example, from your searches or
places that you label such as home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data that we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android deviceâs location on or off
using the deviceâs settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Googleâs Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services which provide us with business information to be displayed on Googleâs services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information that we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, such as processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure that our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services â for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organised their photos in Picasa, Googleâs first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalised services, including content and ads
We use the information that we collect to customise our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalised content and
customised search results
. For example,
Security Check-Up
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps that youâve already installed and videos that youâve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps that you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalised ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for 'mountain bikes', you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Centre
.
We donât show you personalised ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
We donât show you personalised ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail or Photos.
We donât share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the 'tap to call' button, weâll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Centre
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimise product design. And we also use data about the ads which you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information that we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, such as an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, weâll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks and technical issues that could harm Google, our users or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyse your content to provide you with things like customised search results, personalised ads or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyse your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognise patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases that you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information that we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Googleâs services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. For example, this helps people identify an email coming from you.
Weâll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isnât covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how itâs used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Check-Up
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products â you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Check-Up
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When youâre signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content that youâve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls

For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos that you watch and the things that you search for are saved in your account so that you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so that you can get more personalised experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps and devices that use Google services
, such as apps that you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things such as remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When youâre signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads, depending on your Shared Endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
Weâll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third-party apps and sites
that you have given access to data in your Google Account. Weâll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If youâre a student, or work for an organisation that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, such as your email
View statistics regarding your account, such as how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an Internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in 'local storage' mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and re-opened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognise your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partnersâ sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorised access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number, known as an Internet Protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or refers to an individually identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination web page by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last web page the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These âserver logsâ typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for 'cars' looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the userâs ISP. Depending on the userâs service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time theyâve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences and providing personalised advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognise a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your deviceâs settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a deviceâs unique identifier can be used to customise our service to your device or analyse device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google services
If youâre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps and services may be saved in your accountâs Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area that you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least three sq. km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third-party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways that you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads that youâll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for 'pizza'. Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programmes so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers, which donât reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services such as Gmail, Maps, your phoneâs camera and phone dialler, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input and security features. Learn more about
Google Play services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymise data, or encrypt data to ensure it canât be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research and provide transparency about these requests.
customised search results
For example, when youâre signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can obtain more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can

A flight confirmation email that you receive may be used to create a 'check-in' button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your delivery address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service that you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
) and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to the appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device youâd like to use to install an app or view a movie that you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyse how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
information about things near your device
If you use Googleâs Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, such as Google Maps. If you use Googleâs Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer) and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (such as MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
As with other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data that you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesnât follow the correct process. Find out more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyse how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that itâs taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyse its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyses these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over two million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, such as apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, such as a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect date of birth indicating that youâre not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalised ads
You may also see personalised ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiserâs website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places that you label like home and work
You might choose to save places that are important to you, such as your home or your work, to your Google Account. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses at any time in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that's publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google's AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business' information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called âlbcsâ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analysing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The 'last account activity' feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalised ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things such as 'Cooking and Recipes' or 'Air Travel'. We donât use topics or show personalised ads based on sensitive categories such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
who use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to work out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centres located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.

Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
Similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps that we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data that you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned and steps taken.

For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
that youâve left on apps, games and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more

.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability, and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report usage statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information that we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When youâre signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content that you have in other Google products, such as Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things such as the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant and hotel reservations or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by auto-completing their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalised content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, for example sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If youâre a user in the EU, the decisions that you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so that we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely to have been seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like 'Hey Google', Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, for example from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
, and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
