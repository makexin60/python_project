This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) and confirms that Accenture’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.
We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.

Any such transfers throughout Accenture’s global business take place in accordance with the applicable data privacy laws and in accordance with our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”).
Our BCR reflect the standards contained in European data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation).

You have the right to request access to your personal information that we process.
You have the right to obtain the rectification of any inaccurate personal information about you. Your rectification request must be supported by evidence of the inaccuracies in the data you are seeking to have corrected.

above
.
Where we process your personal information based on our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal information on grounds relating to your situation. However, you can also object to processing for direct marketing at any time without any charge or justification.
If we process your personal information with your consent or to fulfill a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transfer this information to another controller.
We do not use automated decision-making processes that have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.
To exercise any of the rights mentioned above, you can contact us with your request as indicated
above
. Please state clearly which right(s) you wish to exercise and provide reasons and proof to support your request, if required. We will acknowledge receipt of your request and proceed to review it.

International Transfers
In order to process your personal information for the purposes outlined above, we may transfer your personal information to others who are located outside of the EEA, including any country where we have partners or service providers.
If these recipients that process your personal information on our behalf are located in a third country for which the European Commission has not yet decided that it ensures an adequate level of protection and where derogations for specific situations do not apply, we will implement appropriate safeguards with regard to the processing of your personal information. Such safeguards may be provided by, for example:
A contract between us and the third-country recipient that is based on the standard contractual clauses for international data transfers adopted by the European Commission; or
Any other transfer mechanism or transfer tool that legitimizes the international transfer of your personal information in compliance with applicable data protection law.
Where we rely on appropriate safeguards for the transfer of your personal information, we will assess whether these safeguards can protect your personal information without diminishing the level of protection guaranteed in the EEA. If these safeguards cannot sufficiently protect your personal information, we will take the additional measures necessary to provide appropriate protection for your personal information. If taking such additional measures is not possible, we will not transfer your personal information to the recipient in a third country or will transfer your personal information to the extent that another mechanism justifies the transfer of your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection law. To obtain a copy of these data protection safeguards or to obtain information about their applicability, please contact us as indicated
above

If you find that we maintain personal information about you that is inaccurate, you have the right to request that we correct such inaccuracy.
The Right to Opt Out of the Sale or Sharing of Your personal information:
California law affords California residents a right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information. We do not “share” your personal information as the term is defined in the CCPA. Rather, this right applies to the extent that we “sell” your personal information as that term is defined under California law. While we are generally not in the business of selling personal information, there are limited circumstances in which we share it with our clients, third-party partners, or others in circumstances that California law treats as a “sale” for which California residents have the right to opt out. This can happen when we transfer data to another company to provide us services, like analyzing how our website is performing or helping us to better understand online behavior and trends. We may also use this data to improve our products and services. Please
click here
or call 1-844-833-2556 (during standard office hours (Pacific Standard Time (PST); available in English only) to opt out of the “sale” of any of your personal information collected through this website.  We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
The Right Not to Receive Discriminatory Treatment:
You are entitled to expect and receive treatment by AFS that does not discriminate against you for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by California law. Similarly, employees, applicants, and independent contractors have a right not to be retaliated against for the exercise of these rights.

Will we share your personal data with third parties?
We may transfer personal data to our service providers and professional advisors, public and governmental authorities, Accenture companies/affiliates or third parties in connection with Accenture’s operation of its business, including any (potential) corporate or commercial transaction and including clients if the data has been processed to provide client services. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Accenture’s internal policies. Accenture may also transfer your personal data to any of its global affiliates/partners in furtherance of any visits to our Accenture locations. If you would like more information on the categories of personal information we may share please read the section titled

Unless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal data from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below). Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal data will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.
What about sensitive data?
We do not generally seek to collect sensitive data as defined in the second paragraph below (also known as special categories within the EEA) through this site or otherwise. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.
The term "sensitive data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you. These categories include racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, biometric or genetic data, sexual life or orientation, or criminal convictions and offences (including information about suspected criminal activities).
What about data security?
We maintain organizational, physical and technical security arrangements for all the personal data we hold. We have protocols, controls and relevant policies, procedures and guidance to maintain these arrangements taking into account the risks associated with the categories of personal data and the processing we undertake.
We adopt market leading security measures to protect your personal data. This includes (without being limitative):
We hold an ISO27001 certification, which indicates that we adhere to the highest and strictest information security standards. This is a security standard awarded by the British Standards Institution (“BSI”) that serves as international certification that Accenture adheres to the highest and strictest standards. This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) and confirms that Accenture’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.
We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.
We have regular penetration testing performed by a third party provider, which continues to show the strength of our technical defenses.
Where will your personal data be processed?
As a global organization with offices and operations throughout the world, personal data we collect may be transferred or be accessible internationally throughout Accenture's global business and between its entities and affiliates.
Any such transfers throughout Accenture’s global business take place in accordance with the applicable data privacy laws and in accordance with our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”).
Our BCR reflect the standards contained in European data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation). Having our BCR means that all our group entities which have signed up to our BCR have to comply with the same internal rules. It also means that your rights (see “Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?”) stay the same no matter where your data are processed by Accenture.
