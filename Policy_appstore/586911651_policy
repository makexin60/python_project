Privacy policy
NestForms is a service offering from NestDesign, we are a registered data controller within the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of the GDPR on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data.
Nest Design recognises the office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland as the Lead Supervisory Authority for regulating all data protection matters.
We are committed to follow and continuously evolving  specific best practices to support our legal obligations in respect of all the  data/information subject to certain legal safeguards as specified in
the
Data Protection Act, 1988 (as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act, 2003)
and the  General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other specific regulations.
NestForms recognises the need to treat data in an appropriate and lawful manner. We are committed to complying with our legal obligations in respect of all personal data we handle as set out in this policy.
At NestForms we take the security of your data very seriously. With this in mind, we chose a leader in cloud computing services, Amazon AWS Web Services. All NestForms live data is stored within Amazon AWS located in Dublin, Ireland (EU).
There are many great reasons we chose to build NestForms on Amazon’s AWS Infrastructure and security and dependability are the main ones.
Amazon AWS provides dozens of critical security features specifically designed to keep your data safe, secure and in your control.
The NestForms system is managed and hosted by NestDesign Ltd. A maximum of four NestDesign employees only ever have full access to the NestForms platform.
Administration access is via SSH console. Access is required for server software updates and maintenance. Outside of scheduled tasks, access to the server is undertaken on a per ticket-only permission basis.
User connection to the Application will be via the Internet. All connections to the Application use 2048-bit SSL (https) connections.  The application is set to respond on port 80 and port 443. All requests to port 80 are redirected to 443 (https).
We make every effort in protecting NestForms and our clients from unauthorised access as well as preventing unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of information managed by Nest Forms.
In particular:
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, to protect against unauthorised access to our systems.
We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all the services offered by NestForms and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy is not applicable to any services offered by other companies or individuals, including online products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, or sites that include NestForms services, or any sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organisations who advertise our services.

Meet any applicable legislation, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with services, such as data storage, hosting and payment processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.
The need to protect ourselves or others, or for other legal reasons. We strongly believe in contesting claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law, and in protecting you from privacy violations we consider to be abuse of legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government. However, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we believe it is reasonably necessary to satisfy or comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants served on us), or to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others, and to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
We need to disclose it as part of a business transaction. Information collected from our users, including PII, could be disclosed or transferred to a third-party acquirer as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale. We will notify you if a different company will receive your PII.
You expressly ask us to do so.
People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used and control whom you share information with.
You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it's important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

Our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content
.

If that information is incorrect, we make every effort to enable you to update it or delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information that are residing on backup tapes).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.
We endeavour to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you requests the deletion of information from our services, we will not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers or remove information from our backup systems.
If you delete any Forms, Responses or your own account, we keep this data for a further 14 days to allow clients that may have made an error and wish to revert their data or status to it’s previous state.
After these 14 days the requested data is permanently deleted. Only responses belonging to another account, will keep your name in the service and NestForms will anonymise any other personal information.
A formal request from a data subject for information that NestForms holds about clients must be made in writing. A fee is payable by the data subject for provision of this information.  Should a written request in respect of data held by NestForms be received the Data Controller is responsible for ensuring compliance with access requests.
Data subjects will be provided with their data within 40 days of receiving the request.
All employees of NestForms have been trained in Privacy Policy and adhere to the Data Protection Policy Procedures have been instructed not to disclose any data/information containing personal characteristics over the telephone/ email and that all requests must be made in writing to the NestForms Data Controller - C.
