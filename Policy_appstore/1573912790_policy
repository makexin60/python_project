notifications to our App’s users on Android and iOS. We

Research
and analysis allow us to get a better understanding of our business,
analyze our performance, improve, maintain, plan, innovate, design,

statistical evaluation in order to review and improve our offers.

that our users prefer working with dark-themed keyboards, we pay
special attention to adding more options for dark keyboards.

certain actions in our App (for example,

it). Thus, we may ask Facebook to show certain ads to a particular
list of users. As a result, you may see more of our ads while you use
Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram).

Ads
is
a service provided by Google that shows ads to
users.
Google allows us to manage the ads so that, for example, only users
who conducted certain actions with our App can see our ads (for
example, only users with subscription will see these ads). Some other
examples of ads management events include: installation of our App,
or completion of a free trial. Google allows its users to
opt
out
of Google’s personalized ads

to
prevent
their data from being used by
Google
Analytics
