App Analytics
To help Apple’s partners and third-party developers improve their apps, products, and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may provide such partners or developers with a subset of analytics information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s app, product, or service, as well as statistics about how you use that partner’s or developer’s app or other similar apps, as long as the analytics information and statistics are aggregated or in a form that does not personally identify you.
You can choose not to share crash data and statistics about how you use apps with third-party app developers. To do so, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and turn off Share With App Developers. If Share iPhone & Watch Analytics is turned off, sharing crash data and statistics with third-party app developers is automatically turned off.
By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information as described above.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
