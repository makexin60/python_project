We will, for example, use Personal Data to provide you with the Services you have requested, to improve and develop our Services, to predict user trends, to make recommendations and carry out marketing activities based on your usage, and to customize our Services to you. This includes the following processing activities:
Lawful basis
Purpose of the processing
Processing is necessary to perform our contract with you as regards our Services.
(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR)
The data provided is used to identify the user by creating an account. The account enables the user to use our services and products.
Data provided by you is used in the handling of requests, in particular support requests for technical problems with the game and the handling of other questions.
The data provided by you, as well as automatically collected data, is used for the technical implementation, operation, and provision of the game. The specific purpose of saving logs is for the technical improvement of our services (quality assurance). To prevent program crashes and other malfunctions in the future, it is necessary to record and analyze them. In the case of a crash of our services or a problem in the game process, an error analysis can be performed by reading the logs in combination with your IP and ID and information about the device used. Chat logs are stored in order to be able to follow up on complaints, e.g. because of insults.
The data provided by you is used to manage the payment transaction and to verify its legality.
Automatically collected data is used to provide solutions against cheating and fraud in our services. In practice, this means that  information is gathered about players’ interactions in the game, and the gathered information is exchanged between Service Providers and us.
Consent of the data subject
(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR)
The data provided by you through your device is used to increase the convenience of using our website.
The data provided by you, as well as automatically collected data, is used to optimize our communication with our existing users as well as sending you interest-based advertisements along with marketing of our services and those of the Stillfront Group.
Both the data provided by you and automatically collected data are used to analyze the browsing behavior of our visitors and users. This helps us to continuously improve our website and its user-friendliness.
Data provided by you in surveys is used for the purposes of improving the game and the customer experience when interacting with our game or services.
Delivery of newsletters, update information and game information, including information about patches, updates, community events, special promotions, personalized updates, interesting information about the development of our games and services and, if applicable, offers related to our game.
Stored relevant payment information and methods submitted by you are used for future transactions.
Data collected through marketing, social media and performance cookies is used to increase the convenience of using our website and to send you advertisements in connection with our Services on different social media platforms.
Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR)
Data automatically collected, or provided by you, may be stored if necessary to comply with tax, commercial, or legal obligations.
In the unlikely event of a dispute or a criminal investigation, we may be legally obligated to transmit personal data to authorities (e.g. requests for information from investigating authorities) or other relevant entities such as legal or natural persons (e.g. to assert claims).  Your Personal Data may also be disclosed to any regulatory body in connection with the prevention and detection of crime and where the Company considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you may be involved in a breach of the law. Those bodies will then use your Personal Data to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.
Legitimate interest of our company to make our Services the best they can be and provide you with the best possible user experience from our Services
(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)
Automatically collected data is used to enable the website to be delivered to the user's device. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session. The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
We use cookies for the operation, maintenance, and enhancement of our web services, such as cookies that allow users to log in to their accounts or to change website language settings.
The data provided by you, as well as automatically collected data, is used to analyze our services and measure the success of our marketing.
Based on our legitimate interest to protect our services from cheaters and fraud
(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)
The data provided by you is used to manage payment transactions and to verify their legality, in particular to prevent fraud and to settle any disputes over payment.
We use logs and inferences based on your use of our services for the purposes of preventing violations of our terms and conditions.
Automatically collected data is used to provide solutions against cheating and fraud in our services.
In addition, we may process your data for additional purposes which are compatible with any of the purposes listed above.
4. Who we share your information with
Your Personal Data will (for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy) be transferred or disclosed to third parties, for the processing of that Personal Data on our behalf, for example:

This data will be shared with a limited group of employees in the Stillfront Group.
Persons or companies that provide services to us and process Personal Data on our behalf when providing those services, for example, services that help us develop and operate our Services. A list of these processors can be found at the bottom of this policy.

We may update the processor list from time to time as needed to fulfill the purposes listed in this privacy notice.
5. Appropriate Safeguards to countries outside the EU/EEA-area
In connection with some processing activities described in this Privacy Policy we share information outside of the European Union (“
EU
”) and the European Economic Area (“
EEA

For example, a number of servers we use for hosting data are located in the United States, and some of our group companies or the service providers we use to provide the Services may be located outside of the EU and the EEA. Where the Company transfers Personal Data outside the EU/EEA, the Company will ensure that Adequacy Decisions apply or Standard Contractual Clauses have been entered into between the transferring entity and the receiving external party. Additional safeguards will also be put in place prior to such transfers.
Data shared will consist of information you provide voluntarily when using our Services, and data collected from your device by automatic means. Under Data Privacy Laws you are entitled upon request to receive a copy of any documentation, demonstrating that appropriate safeguards have been taken in order to protect your Personal Data during a transfer outside of the EU/EEA.

7. Security
Your data is secured by appropriate safeguards, taking into account the circumstances, the state of the art in the industry, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk. In support of this commitment, we have implemented appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data against unauthorized or accidental destruction, alteration or disclosure; misuse; damage; theft or accidental loss; or unauthorized access.
