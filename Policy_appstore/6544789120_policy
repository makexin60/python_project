Metamorph Privacy
Your privacy is extremely important to us. We know giving any app access to your photos is a big deal!
Our promise to you:
The Metamorph app only accesses your photos on your device. Any photos you add to Metamorph from your iCloud library are downloaded to your phone only, in order for Metamorph to read them. We will not use your photos for any other purpose and your photos are never accessible to Metamorph team.
We will not send your photos to our servers.
We will not share your photos with anyone (we have designed Metamorph so that this is impossible for us to do).
We will not access your passwords, credit cards or other sensitive information.
What we do collect:
Anonymous usage statistics (how many people are using the app etc) to make the app better.
Anonymous usage analytics such as screen views and button taps, to improve your user experience.
Anonymous crash reports to make the app more stable.
