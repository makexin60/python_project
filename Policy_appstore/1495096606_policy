How We Collect Your Personal Information
We collect personal information about you through the following sources:
From you directly:
We collect the personal information which you voluntarily provide to us through the Site and Services, for example when you provide your email and date of birth during Member registration or when you provide health-related personal information by participating in one of our voluntary surveys.
Through your interactions with our Site or Services:
When you interact with the Site or Services, we collect personal information about that interaction such as the pages you visit, discussion items you submit, blogs or comments you write, or messages you post. Moreover, we may also use automatic data collection tools (e.g., cookies, web beacons) on the Site to collect technical information about your interaction with the Site or Services (e.g., your IP address, search history, browsing history).
When you correspond with Inspire:
If you contact us to ask a question or report a problem, we may collect personal information provided in that correspondence between you and Inspire.
Through our service providers:
We rely on third-party service providers to assist us with certain parts of our business operations (e.g., data hosting, website performance analysis, system design and maintenance, customer service, advertising and marketing, fraud detection and prevention). These service providers may also collect personal information about you and may share that information with us.
Through other third parties:
We may at times obtain supplemental personal information about you from third parties, such as social media services (if you sign in to our Site via your social media account) or commercial sources of healthcare claim information.
Subject to applicable laws, we may combine personal information about you obtained through different sources. We may also combine your personal information with that of other individuals to create aggregated summary data.
How We Use Your Personal Information
We may use your personal information in several ways:
To provide and improve the Service:
We may use your personal information to confirm your membership, facilitate your use of the Site and Service, understand who is visiting our Site and using our Service, and help us improve the Service.
To provide you with personalized content:
We may use your personal information to provide you with content that better suits your interests, including by sending you both generic and personalized information about Inspire, the Site, the Service, or third parties with whom we have a business relationship. For example, we partner with health associations and advertisers that link to and post content on our Site, and we may occasionally present their content to you if we believe it is of interest to you based on your use of the Site and Services. Likewise, we partner with pharmaceutical companies who occasionally sponsor clinical trials, and we may invite you to participate in an upcoming clinical trial if we believe it may be relevant to you.
To monitor and analyze technical trends, usage, and activities:
We may use your personal information, in particular your “clickstream data” (e.g., IP address, login activity, pages you click on), to monitor and analyze usage patterns and improve performance of the Site and Service. We may also use such personal information to detect malicious or fraudulent activity and protect ourselves, the Site, the Service, and our users against such activity.
To comply with legal obligations and protections:
We may use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or if we believe it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our employees, our business partners, or our users.
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We may share or disclose your personal information as follows:
With other Guests, Members, and the public:
When you register as a Member, your profile (including some of the personal information contained therein) becomes automatically visible to other Guests and Members of the Site and Service. You can control how your profile and personal information contained therein are displayed and shared on the Site by using the privacy settings in the account settings section of the Site. Additionally, when you post information on the Site, such as by creating or replying to journal entries, discussions, or messages, that information is considered to now be publicly disclosed by you and is no longer considered personal information for purposes of this Statement or applicable privacy laws.
With our service providers:
As noted above, we engage third-party service providers to perform certain functions for Inspire, and we may share your personal information with them where reasonably necessary to perform the function for which we have engaged them. Where practicable, personal information shared with third-party service providers will be shared on an aggregated rather than individual basis. These entities are required to adhere to strict confidentiality and data security requirements consistent with this Statement and our specific agreements with them.
With our partner organizations:
We may share your profile information, including personal information contained therein, with our partner organizations, for example, non-profit organizations who sponsor Inspire communities which you may have joined or expressed interest in. Where practicable, personal information shared with third-party service providers will be shared on an aggregated rather than individual basis. These entities are required to adhere to strict confidentiality and data security requirements consistent with this Statement and our specific agreements with them.
As necessary to comply with our legal obligations and protections:
Under certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, regulation, binding order, or other legal or regulatory process. Moreover, we may disclose personal information if we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the rights or property of Inspire, our employees, our business partners, or our users or to protect the safety of any individual, including you.
As necessary in the event of a corporate change:
We may transfer information, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control by Inspire or an affiliated company or organization.
Inspire does not share or sell individually identifiable personal information to any entity in exchange for monetary value, and has not done so in the last 12 months. However, we may at times share personal information with a third party in exchange for other non-monetary benefit, for example, with a health association who in turn agrees to post content on the Site. If you would like to opt out of the sharing of your personal information for non-monetary benefit, you can click “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” or email us at team@inspire.com.
Deactivating Your Membership
If at any time you decide that you would like us to stop processing your personal information, you can deactivate your Membership, and optionally indicate if you desire the removal of all of your posts and replies. You can deactivate your Membership two different ways:
Send an email to team@inspire.com, or
Use the “Permanently close account” function on the Site.
Please note that once you have deactivated your Membership, you may no longer be able to use certain functionalities of the Site and Service, such as posting content or messaging other Members.
Public Forums
This Site may make available chat rooms, blogs, and message boards. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information upon disclosure, and thus is no longer considered personal information for the purposes of this Statement or applicable privacy laws. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information via such chat rooms, blocks, and message boards.
Protecting Your Data
Stewardship of your personal information is critical to us and a responsibility we embrace. Inspire employs commercially reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, to safeguard the personal and other information we collect, use, and store.
Legal Basis for Processing
We only process personal information where we have a legal basis for doing so, which may include: (i) where necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g., in providing and improving the Services, in keeping the Site and Service safe and secure); (ii) where necessary to perform our contractual obligations or to comply with our legal obligations; (iii) where you have consented to our processing (which you can revoke at any time); or (iv) where necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others.
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Statement, including to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements we may have. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information; the purposes for which we process your personal information; whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and our applicable legal requirements.
Children
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Site and Service are not designed or intended to attract children under 13 years old. Moreover, Inspire does not collect personal information from any individual (Member or Guest) whom we actually know to be under 13 years old. You must be at least 16 years old to register as a Member.
Cookies and Online Analytics Tools
We use a standard technology called “cookies” to collect and analyze information about how you use the Site and to help us better administer the Site. Some cookies reside on your computer persistently and help our Site to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor (“persistent cookies”). Other cookies expire when you close your browser and do not retain any information about you after your browsing session has ended (“session cookies”). Cookies allows us to customize delivery of information to you, for example, by remembering your registration information or preferences, ensuring you don't see the same ad content repeatedly, and delivering content specific to your interests. If you prefer, you can set your browser settings to reject all non-essential cookies. However, note that if you reject cookies, certain functions of the Site or the Service may not work properly. To learn more about cookies, you can visit allaboutcookies.org.
Some web browsers also incorporate a Do Not Track option (“DNT Option”) which when switched on sends a signal (“DNT Signal”) indicating to websites that a user does not want to have their online activity tracked. As of the Effective Date, not all browsers offer a DNT Option, and DNT Signals are not yet uniform. Thus, like many other digital service operators, Inspire currently does not respond to DNT Signals. To learn more about DNT Signals, visit allaboutdnt.com.
We use online analytics tools like Braze and Google Analytics to better understand how our Guests and Members interact with our Site. Our use and sharing of information about your visit to our Site collected by each of these tools is governed by that company’s respective terms of service and privacy policy:
Braze Terms of Service and
Privacy Policy
Google Analytics
Terms of Use
and
Privacy Policy
With respect to Google Analytics in particular, you may control and tailor your advertising preferences for specific Google advertising products by visiting the
Google Ads Preferences Manager
or opt out of Google Analytics entirely at any time via the
Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On
.
Links to Other Websites
Note that the Site may contain links to other third-party websites that are not controlled by Inspire. Clicking on such links may allow those third parties to collect your personal information. We do not control these third-party websites, and their collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information is governed by their own privacy statement rather than this Statement. When you leave our Site, we encourage you to read the privacy statement of each website you visit.
Banner Advertising
We allow another company to serve advertisements on our Site. That company may set “cookies” on your computer. We will not share any individually identifiable personal information that you provide to us with such advertising company, and it will not have access to your personal profile. However, it is possible that such advertising company may, through your use of this Site and other websites, develop its own separate profile of you. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is subject to the terms and policies of that company.
Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your state or country of residence, you may have certain privacy rights with respect to your own personal information.
For example, if you reside in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you have the following privacy rights with respect to your personal information:
Knowing about our processing practices.
You have the right to know about our personal information processing practices (i.e., categories of personal information collected and the sources, uses, disclosures, retention, and sale or sharing of such personal information) at or before the point of collection. We have disclosed such practices in this Statement as they apply to personal information of our Guests and Members generally. You may also request that we provide you with the practices that apply to your personal information specifically over the last 12 months preceding your request.
Accessing your personal information.
You have the right to ask us to provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you thus far, in a portable format which you can transmit to another entity. You may not exercise this right more than twice in a calendar year. We will try to provide your requested personal information within 30 days of a written request.
Correcting your personal information.
You have the right to ask us to rectify any of your personal information on our platform that is inaccurate or incomplete.
Deleting your personal information.
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information stored on our platform. We will ask you if you want your personal information to be deleted entirely or if you want to be kept on a list of individuals who simply do not want to be contacted in the future (for a specified period or otherwise). Please note that we may not be required to delete your personal information under certain circumstances as permitted by law, for example, where retention of your personal information is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to complete a transaction, or for certain internal business purposes.
Opting out of sale or sharing of your personal information.
You have the right to opt out of our sale or sharing of your personal information with third parties for monetary or non-monetary benefit. If you would like to opt out, you can click “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” or email us at team@inspire.com.
Limiting use of your sensitive personal information.
You have the right to limit our use of your “sensitive personal information” to only certain necessary business purposes (e.g., providing and maintaining the Service, ensuring data security, sending non-personalized advertising). “Sensitive personal information” refers to a subset of personal information that specifically includes things like government identifiers (e.g., social security number, driver license number), login credentials, race, sexual orientation, religion, geolocation data, genetic information, citizenship, and union membership. If you would like to limit the use of such information to only certain necessary business purposes, you can click “
Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information
” or email us at team@inspire.com.
Not being discriminated against.
You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising the above privacy rights (e.g., by being denied certain goods or services, being offered a different level of quality, or being charged a different price). We will not discriminate against you for exercising your applicable privacy rights.
Knowing about third-party direct marketing (California only).
Under California Civil Code § 1798.83, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request, annually and free of charge, that we provide you a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed your personal information for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year (and the types of personal information disclosed).
Likewise, if you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following privacy rights with respect to your personal information:
Knowing about our processing practices
(as described above).
Accessing your personal information
(as described above).
Correcting your personal information
(as described above).
Deleting your personal information
(as described above).
Restricting the use of your personal information.
We only process your personal information where we have the legal basis for doing so. You have the right to ask us to suspend or otherwise restrict the processing of your personal information where:
You challenge the accuracy of the personal information;
We no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you want us to hold it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have legitimate grounds to use it.
Objecting to automated decision making and profiling.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.
Withdrawing your consent.
Where we rely on your consent as the lawful basis to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
You can exercise any of your applicable privacy rights by contacting us at team@inspire.com and including “Personal Information Privacy Request” in the subject line and your name, email, and address in the email body.  Consumers in some jurisdictions may also authorize an agent to make privacy rights requests on their behalf. In order to process your privacy right request, we may need to first verify your identity by asking you to provide certain personal information (even if the request is submitted by your agent). We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
If we have shared your personal information with any third parties and subsequently receive a privacy rights request from you to correct, delete, or restrict the use or sale/sharing of your personal information, we will notify those third parties of the request where reasonably practicable so that they may reflect the change in their records and practices as well. However, we will not be able to audit those third parties to ensure that such change has occurred.
In some instances, we may reject your privacy rights request if an exception applies under applicable privacy law. If you reside in Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia (but not California or Utah), you may have the right to appeal our rejection. To appeal, you may contact us at team@inspire.com with a copy of or specific reference to our rejection, and we will adequately address your appeal in accordance with applicable law. If you reside in the EEA and we have rejected your request or you believe that we otherwise have not complied with applicable data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
Where We Store and Transfer Your Data
Although we have users all over the world, Inspire and all of its technical infrastructure is located in the United States. For individuals who reside in the EEA or another jurisdiction outside the U.S., you should know that, in order to provide the Services to you, we must transfer your personal information to the U.S. where it will be stored and processed in accordance with this Statement. We may also transfer your personal information to trusted third parties who may be located in the U.S. or in another jurisdiction and who assist us in providing, improving, protecting, and promoting our Services. By using the Services, you consent to such collection, storage, and processing in the U.S. and elsewhere, although the U.S. and other jurisdictions may not afford the same level of data protection as considered adequate in your own country. Whenever we transfer your personal information outside the EEA, we take reasonable steps to protect it in accordance with our legal obligations.
Governing Law
Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this Statement and the provisions of law of the State of Delaware.
Contacting Us
If you have any questions, comments, or requests relating to this Statement or Inspire’s privacy practices, you can contact us at team@inspire.com.
Effective Date
This Statement is effective as of August 28, 2024.

Braze is a life-cycle engagement platform for companies around the world, supporting stronger relationships between brands and their clients, primarily by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate life-cycle marketing campaigns through first party channels, such as email, SMS, mobile and web push notifications, and in-app/in-browser messaging.

1.3 SCOPE OF THIS POLICY
What is in Scope?

What is not in Scope?
Our Websites and Services are intended to be used by businesses and their representatives. We do not offer any products or services to individuals for personal, family or household use. All Personal Data that we process is treated as belonging to individuals in a business capacity.

If you wish to learn more about the privacy and data security practices of those customers, you should reach out to them directly. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not cover any Personal Data that our customers choose to collect and share with Braze, where Braze is not the Data Controller, but is instead a Data Processor.

PART III. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
3.1 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE
Braze, Inc. is located in the United States ("
U.S.
") and our group companies operate in Singapore, Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom ("
UK
"), Ireland, Romania, Brazil, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Braze works with vendors and partners who operate predominantly in these countries. From time to time, we may work with vendors and partners in other parts of the world where we do business. This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we have in place appropriate safeguards and international transfer mechanisms (e.g., the Data Privacy Framework or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses). We also implement a number of supplementary measures designed to better protect the Personal Data with which we are entrusted.
Where available, Braze, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, as applicable, to the US in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework. For more details, please
read our Data Privacy Framework Notice
.
For non-US transfers, Braze may rely on an alternative transfer mechanism, including the 2021 EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to transfer Personal Data from the UK and European Economic Area ("
EEA
") to other third-party countries.
3.2 SECURITY
We use a number of technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information. However, security risk is inherent in internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data.
3.3 DATA RETENTION
We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the purpose for which we process the Personal Data, the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it.
PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
4.1 EXERCISING YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
You may have the right under applicable law to request that we take certain actions in connection with Personal Data that we may have about you. Not all jurisdictions grant privacy rights, so whether or not you have any such rights, and the nature of those rights, if any, are determined by multiple factors, including your location, country, state, or place of residence. Privacy rights may include the following:

Automated Decision Making:
You may be able to request not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, where it produces a legal or similar effect.
If you wish to exercise any of these requests, please
fill out the form provided
. We will respond to requests from individuals wishing to exercise data protection rights applicable to them. For certain rights, such as where you request access to Personal Data, we will need to confirm your identity. To verify your identity, we will require you to provide ID, where permitted or required by applicable law. You also have the right to exercise your applicable privacy rights free from discriminatory treatment and retaliation as prohibited by applicable law. These rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline or partially decline your request as permitted by law.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. If you have a question about your privacy rights, please email us at
privacy@braze.com
.
4.2 PRIVACY RIGHTS AND BRAZE CUSTOMERS
Braze customers may collect Personal Data through their websites or applications and send that data to the Braze Services. Where you wish to enforce any of your rights in respect of such data, we encourage you to contact the customer who provides you with the Customer Application, as this will be the quickest way to have your request processed. Where you submit a request about a Braze customer and you are able to identify the customer, we forward your request to the customer to handle.

' heading below. Dashboard Users of the Services may exercise this right through preference center options available within the Services. Where applicable, you may also opt-out through unsubscribe options available within the marketing communication itself.
Please note that opting-out of the receipt of marketing communications or objecting to the use of your personal data for behavioral advertising does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about event registrations, service announcements or security information.
4.4 COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
You can manage your cookie preferences by
visiting our Cookie Consent Manager to customize your cookie settings
. Please see our
Cookie Policy
for further information on cookies and other tracking technologies.

This information includes details you have shared through online chats, data on sections of the Website you have visited, your IP address and your general geographic information (e.g., city, state). This Personal Data may be processed for the purposes outlined in Section 2.2 of this Privacy Policy.
PART V. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
If you are from a region that requires us to have a legal basis for processing your Personal Data, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
PART VI. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you are a California resident, this section applies to you in addition to the rest of the Privacy Policy.

Dashboard Users of the Services can also opt-out of the selling or sharing of contact details through setting preference center options available within the Services.
While our Website and Services are not directed to children under the age of 16, we are required to inform you that we have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the Personal Information of California residents under 16 years of age.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting

.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
