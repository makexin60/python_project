Privacy Policy & Terms of use smalltech sàrl
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you as a user of our mobile applications and our services, how this information is processed, and how you can opt out of certain types of processing.
1. Information about the responsible entity
The entity responsible for our sites, mobile applications and our services is
smalltech sàrl , Chemin des Mouettes 14, 1007 Lausanne, VD, Switzerland.
This Privacy Policy applies on the same basis to each website, mobile application or services referred to above.
2. What is personal information?
Personal information means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual.
3. How do we process personal information?
Our apps and websites do not share personal information with third parties. When you write us a mail we'll have your address but we won't use it for anything else than helping you with our apps. We do use anonymous traffic analysis. We only log anonymous technical information mostly in order to adapt fast to the constant hardware and software variations.
4. Specific use of personal information regarding Mobile Applications (“Apps”)
4.1 Location data during the use of Apps
Apps downloaded to your mobile phone or tablet may rely on location based services, such as your Global Positioning System (“
(GPS)
”) to inform you about forecasts regarding your current location automatically or upon demand. Such location-based functions are set by default. You may deactivate or reactivate these functions in the settings of your respective device. Before or after installing the Apps – depending on your device – you will be asked whether you prefer to (de)activate these functions. We may only collect data regarding your location if you turn on such location services.
The app may also find your location based on your address IP. These requests are fully anonymised. Access logs are disabled on servers so your IP address isn't stored, logged or shared. Only your app on your device will have this information and only use it to select the appropriate city to display to you.
The data regarding your location will be anonymised after your forecast request. This anonymous data will be analysed to optimise our services. This does not identify your device or you. However, we may process your location if you have given the appropriate consent.
4.2 Collection of personal information during the use of Apps
We don't collect any personal information from our users.
4.3 Use of Google Analytics or Google Firebase during the use of Apps
For statistical analysis of our Apps we use either Google Analytics or Firebase. We use only basic features of the analytics to understand the number of users, their characteristics, and where they come from. We don't track any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
4.4 Use of Advertising ID tracking technology
We also collect information about your access to the Apps using Apple’s iOS IDentifier for Advertising (“
IDFA
“) and the Google Advertising ID (“
GAID
”), which is technology similar to cookies.
This technology comprises pieces of software that include a unique reference code that store and sometimes tracks information about you. These can last only for the duration of your use of the Apps. Others are used to remember you when you return to the App and will last for longer.
We use these technologies to:
allow you to move around the Apps more quickly and easily;
remember your last login;
customise elements of the layout and/or content of the Apps for you;
collect anonymised, statistical information about how you use the Apps so that we can improve the Apps;
Gather information about your use of the Apps on a pseudonymous, no-name basis. This information is used to identify and place advertising which is believed to be relevant to you.
You can opt-out of such tracking mechanisms at any time. If you would like to opt-out of technology we employ through our Apps, you may do so by blocking, deleting or disabling them as your device permits.
4.5 Use of Crashlytics during the use of Apps
Our Apps use the analysis tools crashlytics by
Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
These tools use anonymised IP addresses for analytical purposes. Thus, it is impossible to deduce who the particular person using the respective IP address is. Crashlytics provides us with analysis on system failures in real time and facilitates the system’s maintenance. You will find further information regarding crashlytics here: http://try.crashlytics.com/terms.
