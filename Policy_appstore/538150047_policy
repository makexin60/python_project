Privacy Policy
Pepper Networks, LLC (Pepper), the makers of the Movie Maker 3D app, takes your privacy very seriously.
Pepper does not collect any personal data.
Movie Maker 3D does not store any data on servers under control of Pepper. Movie Maker 3D only stores your data locally on your iOS device and, if your device is signed in to Apple’s iCloud service, Movie Maker 3D uses your private iCloud storage in Apple’s iCloud service to sync your Movie Maker 3D data between your devices.
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/governance/
If you use shared projects in Movie Maker 3D, it also uses your private storage in Apple’s iCloud to share data between you and the users that you invite to your shared projects.
If you choose to use the optional avatar 3D model Face & Voice animation features, Movie Maker 3D uses the iOS and iPadOS ARKit face-tracking services. Movie Maker 3D only uses the face-tracking services to record your face movements to animate the face of your 3D avatars. The ARKit face-tracking APIs internally use the iOS / iPadOS TrueDepth camera services. Before Movie Maker 3D can start face-tracking, your explicit permission is requested by an iOS / iPadOS prompt. Movie Maker 3D does not collect or store any personally identifiable TrueDepth camera data; it only records facial expression and movement data for avatar animation. Movie Maker 3D face-tracking is only done when you explicitly start recording and during recording, Movie Maker 3D always displays both a real-time image of the face-tracking camera image and the animations.
When you decide to save a facial animation recording for your avatar, Movie Maker 3D saves the animation data in a local file on your device. If you have enabled iCloud, the local file is also synced and stored in your own private or shared iCloud storage. If you decide to invite other users to view or collaborate on your iCloud stored 3D project, the animation information will be available to the invited users. Pepper never has access to any of your face-tracking data and Pepper never shares any face-tracking animation data with any third parties.
If you choose to create an optional custom avatar 3D model Movie Maker 3D uses the Ready Player Me avatar creator and editor at timebox.readyplayer.me, which Movie Maker 3D displays in a captive web browser. The timexbox.readyplayer.me subdomain is hosted by Ready Player Me with all third-party tracking disabled. The full Ready Player Me Privacy Policy is available at
https://readyplayer.me/privacy
.
All of your Movie Maker 3D data can be exported in a variety of portable, user-readable formats, including PDF files, via the Action button available throughout Movie Maker 3D.
The only time employees of Pepper ever see personal data is when someone voluntarily enters their email into our newsletter subscription form (via the Sign Up for Movie Maker 3D News button) or to Contact Developer (via the Contact Developer button). Our mailing list is powered by MailChimp, a GDPR-compliant service, and we do not sell or otherwise share any personal information we see from support requests. If you use the Contact Developer button in Movie Maker 3D, it will allow you to compose an email to Pepper that includes your email address and it may also include an error log file attachment that may help us resolve your problem, but which you can optionally delete before sending.
If Movie Maker 3D ever crashes, we receive anonymous, crash logs from Apple in order to fix bugs and improve Movie Maker 3D.
You can easily delete your Movie Maker 3D data from iCloud using the Settings app on your iPhone and iPad. To do so, launch the iOS Settings app, tap your name, then iCloud, Manage Storage, Movie Maker 3D, then Delete Data. This will delete all of your Movie Maker 3D data in iCloud, including everything you’ve shared in shared projects.
The
moviemaker3d.com
web site is used by Pepper to host information about the Movie Maker 3D app.
Timeboxapp.com
is hosted by Squarespace.com. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy describes our use and treatment of data.

Privacy Policy
English
Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we design our products and services according to the principle of privacy by default and collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our users with a product or service. We provide one version of our software to our users. When we do collect that data, we retain it for only so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in our
Privacy Policy
or in our
service-specific privacy notices
, or as required by law.
We also deploy industry-leading consent mechanisms to allow our customers to choose whether to share data such as their Location, Contacts, Reminders, Photos, Bluetooth Sharing, Microphone, Speech Recognition, Camera, Health, HomeKit, Media & Apple Music, and Motion & Fitness Data, and more with apps.
Apple has a cross-functional approach to privacy governance. Privacy governance covers all areas of the company and includes both customer and employee data. The Legal Team has a Vice President in charge of Privacy and Law Enforcement Compliance who reports directly to Apple’s General Counsel. Apple also has a Privacy Engineering team that partners with the Privacy Legal team and dedicated Product Counsel to design products from the ground up to protect customer privacy and to ensure that we protect that data as long as it remains under the control of Apple. This includes strong processes around ensuring that data collected is used only for the intended lawful purposes.
Apple also has a Privacy Steering Committee chaired by Apple’s General Counsel, with members including Apple’s Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy and a cross-functional group of senior representatives from Internet Software and Services, Software Engineering, Product Marketing, Corporate Communications, Information Services & Technology, Information Security, Privacy Legal, and the Head of Business Assurance. The Privacy Steering Committee sets privacy standards for teams across Apple and acts as an escalation point for addressing privacy compliance issues for decision or further escalation.
The Privacy Steering Committee also oversees instances where data for which Apple is responsible is managed or hosted by a third party on Apple’s behalf. We review those third parties prior to engagement and subsequently through audits and documentation reviews to ensure that they can meet the same standards of security as Apple.
Further, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board of Directors with the oversight and monitoring of
privacy and data security
.
All Apple employees are required to take annual training on
Business Conduct
, which reflects our commitment to respect human rights and to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Privacy training is an essential part of Business Conduct Training. Apple requires its employees who have access to Apple customer data and personal information to undergo an additional Privacy and Security Training course on a bi-annual basis or in response to updated laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). There is additional tailored privacy and security training provided on a per-team basis to employees who handle or have access to high volumes of data, sensitive personal data, or as additionally required by local law. Adherence to Apple’s privacy and security standards including those related to de-identification is subject to audit by the Apple Privacy Compliance Audit & Verification team.
We also have a clear process through our
dpo@apple.com
email address for employees to raise any privacy queries or questions that they have. A dedicated team manages all queries received to resolution.
As part of our GDPR and human rights work, we undertake Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for our major products and services and integrate PIAs as we develop new products and services. Reviews include assessments of whether there is decision making relying upon algorithmic systems and the impact that such decision making has on individuals and their rights. Risk levels are assigned to all data uses with re-review periods ranging from one to two years depending on the identified risk. If personal data is used for the development of algorithmic systems, in keeping with Apple’s industry leading control for users, we provide our users with a means to consent and control such data use. We also fully assess the privacy practices of all acquisitions as part of the PIA process. The PIAs take into consideration how laws affect privacy and assess any associated privacy risks in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate. PIA reviewers are also trained to identify and highlight potential impacts to freedom of expression. Apple also regularly engages with a wide range of civil society representatives globally on various privacy and freedom of expression issues, including privacy by design and encryption.
Apple maintains current
ISO 27001
and
27018
certifications. Apple undergoes yearly re-audits in order to receive these certifications.
Data Security and Incident Response
To make sure your personal data is secure, we strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company. This means that we use access management and access controls commensurate with the risk to data to ensure access to data is associated with a business need, such as providing you with support. The
Apple Platform Security
guide provides in-depth technical details on how we have designed our operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, as well as our products and services to protect your security, including iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple also makes information available to the public about the
Apple Security Bounty
program.
When Apple becomes aware that it may have experienced a data security incident that might affect our users’ personal data, we have dedicated teams in place to investigate and learn what happened and determine what steps to take in response. If we find any such impact, we work immediately to close it and identify remediation steps including by way of software updates if applicable.
We analyze these facts — in the context of applicable laws, regulations, industry norms, and most of all Apple’s established commitment to privacy — to determine whether we should notify affected individuals, or other relevant parties like regulators. Apple ensures that it complies with all applicable laws that require notification about data security incidents without undue delay. We may make such notifications by way of a phone call or email.
That means we conduct prompt investigations and analysis, so that we can provide notification in a timely manner when necessary. We are also committed to providing users that have been affected by an incident with appropriate assistance, which may include information on steps they can take to reduce the risk of harm or support from AppleCare.
Apple is not aware of any instances where a user’s iCloud data was stolen or leaked through a breach of iCloud servers. If you have questions about incidents, please
contact us
. For information about Apple’s handling of government requests for customer data, visit
Transparency Report
.
Privacy Complaints
If a user makes a privacy complaint that indicates a material privacy issue, we will take steps to remediate that issue at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a material negative impact on a user or related third party, we will take steps to address that with that user or that other person.
Privacy Policy Updates
When there is a material change to our Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on the webpage on which our Privacy Policy is posted at least a week in advance of doing so and contact users directly about the change if we have their data on file to do so.
Private Requests for User Information
Apple does not provide user information to any third parties where such information is requested without a clear legal basis that allows Apple to do so. Even in such circumstances, Apple undertakes a thorough review of the legal basis cited, and in the absence of such a legal basis will respond only where compelled to do so via a court order or other equivalent process. Apple is committed to transparency about all such requests and publishes
a detailed report
that is updated periodically.
De-Identification of Personal Data
De-identification is the process of removing the association between a set of identifying personal data and an individual such that the data can no longer be used to identify that individual. Within Apple, for data to be considered de-identified, all personal data elements must be removed, including full IP address and any identifiers linked to personal data.
Accountable Data Transfer
To perform processing activities such as those described in our Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services, your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by
Apple-affiliated companies
, Apple service providers, or partners wherever they are located. The service providers and partners we use may differ depending on where you live. For example, our Emergency SOS via satellite calls or texts in some Asian countries may be routed through our service provider’s relay center in Malaysia to ensure effective and efficient connection with the appropriate emergency services. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures. For users in Japan, information about where the legal systems of some countries could affect proper handling of specific user information can be found on the
PPC website
.
Accountability requires organizations to take responsibility for data handling and demonstrate that their practices, systems, policies, and training are achieving Apple’s compliance objectives. With ongoing oversight and assurance reviews, Apple has received privacy accountability certifications for its global privacy program since 2014 that adhere to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework
. In APEC countries where Apple operates, the international transfer of personal data collected abides by the
APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System
and the
Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System
. Apple’s global privacy policy and practices are reviewed by an approved independent third-party Accountability Agent who monitors and enforces compliance with APEC CBPR and PRP program requirements. For remediation and external enforcement, individuals can contact our
third-party dispute resolution provider
.

” and “
you

Please also bear in mind that this Privacy Policy applies only if We collect personal data from you, i.e. if you use your selfie for creating the Avatar or give Us your e-mail address (or provide Us any other personal data). If We do not collect your personal data, then We do not process your personal data and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply.
1.5. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above. We have the right to unilaterally make amendments to this Privacy Policy. In such case the amended Privacy Policy shall be uploaded and you will be notified of that once you launch the Platform again.

3.1. We collect and process your personal data for the following purposes:
a) providing the Services to you via the Platform, which mainly means the creation of your Avatar;

c) improving the Platform and the Avatar generation quality;
d) providing you information about updates to the Platform and to uses of the Avatar;
e) enforcing and defending Our legal rights;
f) complying with legal or regulatory obligations or requests;

If you contact us, We will keep a record of that correspondence. The information you give Us may include your name and e-mail;
b)
information We gather via the Platform (“Gathered Information”)
: this is visual information that is gathered via the forward-facing camera of your device, if you use selfie for creating the Avatar.

c)
information from the cookies (“Cookie Information”)

g) for purpose stated above in clause 3.1.g) – Cookie Information.
3.4. The provision of personal data by you is not a statutory requirement. It is also not a contractual requirement nor a requirement necessary to use the Services where you do not create an account at the Platform (“
Account
”). This means that you do not have any obligation to give Us your personal data and you can use the Services without giving Us any of your personal data. However, if you want to create the Account, you must provide your e-mail address, this is a contractual requirement and necessary for creating the Account (but creating the Account is voluntary). Also, some functions of the Platform may be limited if personal data is not provided.
3.5. The purpose of processing the Gathered Information is not to allow or confirm your unique identification. As such, the Gathered Information is not considered as biometric data under the General Data Protection Regulation of EU no. 2016/679.

We process your personal data because it is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract concluded between you and Us for providing you the Services (see clauses 3.1.a) and 3.1.b)); or for taking steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (see clause 3.1.b)). In such a case the legal basis for processing data is the contract concluded between you and Us; or your request prior to entering into a contract.
4.2. We also process your personal data to improve the Platform and the Avatar generation quality (see clause 3.1.c)). In this case the legal ground for processing your personal data is your prior consent. If you do not give Us your consent We will not process your personal data for that purpose. You may at any time withdraw your consent by sending a respective notice to Our e-mail at
support@readyplayer.me
. Withdrawal of consent does not affect your right to use the Services and the Platform.
4.3. Furthermore, We process your personal data (i.e. use your e-mail address) for sending you information about updates to the Platform and to uses of the Avatar (see clause 3.1.d)). But We do it only in the case where you have given Us your e-mail address. The legal basis for that is Our legitimate interest to keep you the in loop of any advancements which the Platform may get (e.g. new customization options, etc.), any news about the Platform and any new use cases for the Avatar. You always have the possibility to unsubscribe from such e-mails by clicking on a link which is provided under each e-mail. If you unsubscribe, We will no longer send you such e-mails.
4.4. We also process your personal data for enforcing and defending Our legal rights under legitimate interest pursued by Us (see clause 3.1.e)). It is Our legitimate interest to enforce and defend Our legal rights as We see it necessary.
4.5. Also, We process personal data for complying with legal or regulatory obligations or requests (see clause 3.1.f)) as processing is necessary for compliance with the legal obligations to which We are subject to.
5. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA

f)
Legal authorities, institutions and other parties under law
. If We are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request. In order to:

5.3. From  time to time, We may make your personal data also available to the respective Developer which services you are using. As a general rule, such Developer processes your personal data itself as an independent personal data controller and We are not liable for personal data processing by such Developer.
6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES
6.1. Our Platform may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of Our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates (including, but not limited to, websites on which the Platform is advertised).
6.2. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services.
7. HOW LONG PERSONAL DATA IS STORED
7.1. We only store your personal data as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is processed – once the purpose has ceased, the personal data will be erased or anonymised.
7.2. If you create an Account with Us and provide your selfie for creating the Avatar(s), then: (i) your face encodings are deleted immediately after creating each Avatar; (ii) your selfie is deleted once you close your Account, or 3 years after your last visit to the Platform, whichever occurs sooner (or sooner at your request); and (iii) your Avatar data file(s) are deleted once you close your Account. We retain your selfie and Avatar data file(s) for the aforementioned period for the purpose of providing you the Services (see clause 3.1). To be more specific, We retain the selfie to allow you to change the style of your Avatar(s) using the existing selfie, without needing to take new one. However, for data minimisation purposes, We ask you to take a new selfie once for changing the style once the 3 years have passed. Furthermore, We retain your Avatar data file(s) to allow you to use your Avatars.
7.3. Your other personal data will be stored as follows:
a) if you have registered the Account, then up to 30 days after deletion of the Account or where you do not have the Account, then up to 3 years after the last time We provided the Services to you (e.g. 3 years since you created the Avatar or modified the Avatar, whichever happens later) where We process your personal data regarding the provision of the Services (see clause 3.1.a);
b) if you have registered the Account, then up to 30 days after deletion of the Account or where you do not have the Account, then up to 3 years after the last contact with you, where We processes your personal data regarding communicating and providing customer support (see clause 3.1.b));
c) until you withdraw your consent, where We process your personal data for improving the Platform and generation of the Avatar and displaying Ready Player Me advertisements. If personal data is collected with cookies, even if the respective consent is still valid, we do not retain personal data longer than the deletion period for the respective cookies, or as otherwise stated in Our Cookie Policy
https://readyplayer.me/cookies
(see clauses 3.1.c) and 3.1.g));

Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 31, 2025
Squarespace (“Squarespace,” “we,” “us” or “our”) respects your privacy. When it comes to your personal information, we believe in transparency. That’s why we’ve set out here what personal information we collect, what we do with it and your choices and rights.
By using or accessing any of our sites, templates, products, applications, tools, services and features (collectively, the "Services"), you confirm you have agreed to the
Terms of Service
and have read and understood this Privacy Policy and our
Cookie Policy
. The Squarespace entity that controls your information depends on where you are located. See
Section 12 below
.
You can find out about your rights and choices in
Section 6 below
. We’ve also included at the end of this Privacy Policy some region-specific supplemental information if you are located in: (i)
California
; or (ii)
a U.S. state (other than California) with an applicable data privacy law
.
For clarity, we use different defined terms in this Privacy Policy to refer to the different parties who interact with our Services:
A “User” is someone who visits or uses one of our sites, such as
www.squarespace.com
,
www.acuityscheduling.com
,
www.unfold.com
or
www.biosites.com
or mobile applications.
A “Customer” is one of our Users who has an account with us. Customers may use our Services to register domain names, create websites (including scheduling pages) and other content, and otherwise manage and market their online businesses.
An “End User” is someone who visits, purchases from, makes a booking with or otherwise uses one of our Customer’s sites that was created using, and is hosted on, our Services.
We also use different terms in this Privacy Policy to differentiate between our roles under global data privacy laws with respect to the personal information we process:
“Squarespace Controlled Information” is personal information for which Squarespace acts as the “data controller” (or similar term under applicable law) and determines the purposes and means of processing. This includes information about our Users and Customers. We also act as an independent data controller for personal information relating to End Users which we automatically receive (including via cookies or similar tracking technology) when an End User visits a site hosted on our Services (such as the End User’s IP address) when we process it for our own purposes, including to foster the security and integrity of our Services.
“Customer Controlled Information” is personal information for which a Customer acts as the “data controller” (or similar term under applicable law) and determines the purposes and means of processing. This includes any personal information included in the content uploaded by a Customer to our Services for display on their site, a Customer’s domain registration contact information and all information about a Customer’s End Users (including information provided by an End User to a Customer via a webform on the Customer’s site as well as information automatically received (including via cookies or similar tracking technology) when an End User visits the Customer’s site).
We explain below how we collect and use Squarespace Controlled Information and your rights.  If you are an End User of one of our Customers’ sites: (a) read below to learn about how we collect and use your Site Usage Information (as described in
Section 2 below
); and (b) you should read that Customer’s site’s privacy policy to find out more about how they use and otherwise process Customer Controlled Information about you.

Appendix I. California Supplemental Information
Appendix II. Other US States Supplemental Information
1. How does this Privacy Policy apply?
This Privacy Policy describes what we do with Squarespace Controlled Information, such as Customer account information, information about how Users use and interact with our Services, information Users submit to our customer support, and, when we use it for our own purposes, including to foster the security and integrity of our Services, End User information which is automatically collected when an End User visits a Customer’s site hosted on our Services.
We have separate privacy policies that apply in relation to our processing of personal information relating to our staff and applicants for jobs at a Squarespace group company.
We use cookies and similar technologies. Our
Cookie Policy
describes what we do in that regard.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Customer Controlled Information as described above.
For Customer Controlled Information, Squarespace acts as a data processor, service provider or similar term under applicable law. This means we process a Customer’s Customer Controlled Information on behalf of, and pursuant to, the instructions of that particular Customer. We also use and disclose Customer Controlled Information:
to enforce our
Terms of Service
and other legal terms and policies;
to comply with applicable legal requirements, such as tax and other government regulations and industry standards, contracts or law enforcement requests; and
in the case of domain registration contact information, to comply with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), registry, ccTLD or registrar rules, regulations and policies.
Our Customers are responsible for ensuring that their collection and processing of Customer Controlled Information complies with applicable law. If you are a Customer looking for contractual provisions about how Squarespace will treat and secure your Customer Controlled Information, please see our
Data Processing Addendum
.

Payments Services Identity Verification Information also includes details that are listed on such official government documents.

3. How we collect your information
We obtain information about you from various sources. We do this in three main ways:
You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).
We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or, where you are an End User, from your visits to Customers’ sites (including with technologies like cookies).
We receive some of it from third parties (like when you register for an account using a third party service like Apple, Facebook or Google, when you purchase our products from an authorized reseller, when you make payments to us using our payment processor or via a mobile app store or when we receive information about potential enterprise sales leads).
We’ve described this in more detail below.
a. Information you provide
When you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways. For instance, we ask you to provide your Customer Account Details to create and manage your account. We also maintain your Marketing Preferences and your Communication Information that you provide to us. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, participating in user research or entering a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.
Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example:
we may ask you to provide a mailing address and/or select your jurisdiction when you sign up for our paid Services (e.g., purchase a subscription) to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you; or
if you use the Payments Services through the Services, in accordance with the
Squarespace Payments Terms
, in order to provide the Payments Services and to comply with our contractual and legal obligations, we collect additional information related to the Payments Services and Processing Services, including Payments Services Account Information and possibly Payments Services Identity Verification Information.
We’ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide requested information, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.
b. Information obtained from your use of our Services
When you use our Services, we collect Site Usage Information and Account History Information about your activity on and interaction with the Services. If permission has been granted through your device settings, Site Usage Information for our mobile apps may include your precise location information.
If you are an End User of a Customer’s site, we also get Site Usage Information about your interactions with their sites.
Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services or, if you are an End User, when you visit a Customer’s site. We let our Customers control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to properly provide the Services, such as for functionality, performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our
Cookie Policy
. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.
c. Information obtained from other sources
If you use a third party service (such as Apple, Facebook or Google) to register for an account, the third party service may provide us with your Customer Account Details on your behalf, but we don’t collect or store passwords you use to access third party services. We do not control what information a third party service provides to us. The third party service you use may give you options on what the service discloses to us if you link your third party service account with the Services. Make sure you are comfortable with what these third party services share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the third party service.
If you sign up for our paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products, the reseller business partner may provide us with information on your behalf which is necessary for us to complete your paid Services sign up, such as your Customer Account Details.
If you use third party services which are integrated with the Services, including financial products, we may receive information about your use of such third party services via our integration business partners.
Currently, our payment processors are Stripe and PayPal. Each payment processor uses and processes your complete payment information in accordance with its applicable privacy policy (
Stripe
and
PayPal
).
If you sign up for paid Services with us using a payment card, we obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits, the country of issuance and the expiration date.
If you sign up for paid Services with us using PayPal or another non-payment card payment method, we may obtain information about your payment method from our payment processor, such as: (i) for PayPal, the email address associated with your PayPal account; and (ii) for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the last four digits of your bank account number, the country of your bank account and your bank’s bank code and branch code.
The preceding payment processors paragraph is not applicable:
if you sign up for paid Services as an in-app purchase via a mobile app store, in which case the mobile app store’s privacy policy will apply. Please see
Google's privacy policy
and
Apple's privacy policy
for information about how they use and process your payment information.
if you sign up for paid Services via a third party service acting as an authorized reseller of our products. Please see the authorized reseller’s privacy policy for information about how they use and process your payment information.

Advertising
. Learn about and analyze your interactions with our Services and third parties’ online services so we can tailor our advertising to what we think will interest you.

We commit to not de-aggregating or re-identifying the aggregated and/or anonymized data that we process. Our use and disclosure of de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may use and disclose it to others for any purpose, without limitation.

5. How we disclose your information
We may disclose information about you in the following circumstances:
Vendors:
We disclose information about you to our vendors (including our affiliates) that perform services on our behalf. These include providers of the following types of services:
Customer support vendors
. These vendors assist us in hosting our support offerings (including our support guides and message boards or forums) and helping us track, manage and respond to customer support inquiries. We disclose data such as Customer Account Details and Communication Information to them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Sales and marketing vendors
. These vendors assist us in sending marketing and other communications. We disclose data such as Customer Account Details and Account History Information to them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Information technology vendors
. These vendors enable us to operate our Services in a fast, reliable manner by providing us with technology services like data hosting and cloud computing resources. We disclose data such as Customer Account Details, Account History Information, Payment Information and Site Usage Information to them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Safety and security vendors
. These vendors enable us to keep our Services safe and secure, such as by scanning, detecting and investigating possible violations of our policies or suspicious behavior, including fraud or other security or safety violations. We share Customer Account Details and Site Usage Information with them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Payments Services vendors
. These vendors (including
Stripe
,
Sift
and
Plaid)
enable us to operate and provide the Payments Services, provide the Processing Services, perform administrative payment functions, perform individual identity or bank verification and prevent or investigate suspected risk, fraud, security threats, illegal and malicious activity or violations of the
Squarespace Payments Terms
. In accordance with the
Squarespace Payments Terms
, we may disclose Customer Account Details, Payments Services Account Information, Account History Information, Payments Services Identity Verification Information and Site Usage Information to them to enable them to provide these services to us.
Professional advisors
. In limited cases, we may need to disclose your information with our professional advisors like our external lawyers or financial advisors who help us comply with our legal and financial obligations. Depending on the circumstances, we may share any of the information described in
Section 2 above
to them.
Business partners
. We may disclose information about you to our business partners. These include the following types of partners:
Reseller business partners
. We partner with companies who are authorized to resell our products on our behalf to Customers. We may disclose information to  these authorized resellers to provide you with support. For example, if you need support related to a resold Service, we may disclose information such as Account History Information to these resellers to assist them and us in resolving your issue.
Online advertising business partners
. We partner with advertising platforms so they and we can provide you with tailored advertising and measure and monitor its effectiveness. For example, we may: (a) disclose your Account History Information and, if you’re a Customer, your Site Usage Information, to a third party social media platform on which we advertise to avoid serving our ads to people who are already paying Customers; or (b) disclose information about you to a third party ad serving platform to target our ads to Customers who created accounts but have not yet signed up for paid Services.

Third party plugins and social networks
. We may disclose information about you to other parties that operate website plugins, social media platforms or similar third party services to improve your experience, at your direction, or when you intentionally interact with the plug-in. For example, when you use a third party service to create or log in to your account, we disclose the fact that you did so with that third party service.
Process payments
. We transmit your Payment Information via an encrypted connection to our payment processors.
Following the law or protecting rights and interests
. We disclose your information if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, protect our or others’ rights, property or interests (such as enforcing our
Terms of Service
), prevent fraud or abuse of Squarespace or our Customers or their End Users or prevent other criminal or illegal activity. For example, we may disclose your information in response to valid legal requests sent by public or governmental authorities (such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) or sent by third party nongovernmental individuals or organizations pursuant to a validly issued subpoena, other valid legal process under applicable law or bona fide request to investigate or prevent criminal or other illegal activity.

Section 2 above
to them.

as part of the negotiation, consideration or effectuation of such transaction.

6. Your rights and choices
Where applicable law requires (and subject to any relevant exceptions or obligations under law), you may have the right to access, port, update, change or delete personal information.
You may have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information or to exercise a right to data portability under applicable law.
You can access, update, change or delete personal information (or that of your End Users) in your account. You can also delete your account by following the instructions in
this support guide
. Please note that we may need to verify your identity in connection with your requests, and such verification process may, if you do not have access to your account, require you to provide us with additional information we maintain about you to verify your identity. Even if you have access to your account, we may request additional information if we believe it’s necessary to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity or request, we may not, in accordance with applicable law, be able to fulfill your request. You may also contact us by email at
privacy@squarespace.com
to submit a request.
Please note that, for technical reasons, there will likely be a delay in deleting your personal information from our systems when you ask us to delete it. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we may also retain personal information in order to comply with the law, protect our or others’ rights, resolve disputes or enforce our legal terms or policies.
Additionally, if we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.
You can also elect not to receive marketing communications by changing your preferences in your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions in such communications.
Our
Cookie Policy
explains how you can manage cookies and similar technologies.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, subject to applicable law. See
Section 12 below
.
If you are an End User, you should contact the applicable Customer to exercise your rights with respect to any information they hold about you which they control.

7. How we protect your information
While no service is completely secure, we have a dedicated security team. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are intended to appropriately protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse and any other unlawful form of processing, of the personal information in our possession. We employ security measures such as using firewalls to protect against intruders, building redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it) and testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities.
Back to top
8. How we retain your information
We retain your information for as long as your account is active or for as long as needed to provide you with the Services. We also retain your information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, protect us in the event of disputes, enforce our agreements or to protect our or others’ interests.
The precise periods for which we keep your information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.
As Customers may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, if you’re a Customer, we may not immediately delete your information when your trial expires or you cancel all your paid Services. Instead, we keep your information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
You may delete your account by following the instructions in
this support guide
and/or contacting us at
privacy@squarespace.com
.
Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we may create, collect and/or maintain de-personalized information, which we may retain indefinitely.

9. Data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to countries other than where you live, such as, for example, to our servers in the US. We also store your information locally on the devices you use to access the Services.
Your personal information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. For example, data we store may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances.
We rely upon a number of means to transfer personal information which is subject to European Region data protection laws. These include:
Adequacy decision
. We may, in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that are in a country that European Commission, UK or Swiss data protection supervisory authority(ies) have confirmed, by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection (“adequacy decision”). We rely on these adequacy decisions to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as the UK. The adequacy decisions are available at the following links:
European Commission adequacy decisions
;
UK adequacy decisions
; and
Swiss adequacy decisions
.
Data Privacy Frameworks
. We transfer personal data to Squarespace, Inc. in the US from, as applicable, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks. An adequacy decision was adopted for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (each individually and jointly, the “Data Privacy Frameworks).
Standard data protection clauses (“SCCs”) and other transfer methods
. For countries without an adequacy decision, we transfer, in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR, personal information to recipients that have entered into the approved form of transfer contract (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data outside the European Region. We rely on SCCs to transfer personal information to recipients located in countries such as Australia. We may, where there is no adequacy decision, alternatively make a transfer based upon Article 46 of the GDPR using an approved certification mechanism or code of conduct or binding corporate rules.
You can find out more information about these transfer mechanisms
here
or you can request a copy from us.

10. Data Privacy Frameworks
Squarespace, Inc. complies with the Data Privacy Frameworks to provide a legal basis for transfers of personal data to Squarespace, Inc. in the US from, as applicable, the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. Squarespace, Inc. has certified its compliance to the Data Privacy Frameworks.
Squarespace, Inc.’s certification extends to its processing of personal information (received from the European Region under the Data Privacy Frameworks) of the type and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy also describes the types of third parties to which personal information is disclosed (and the purposes for such), individual’s right of access, the choice and means offered to limit the use and disclosure of personal information and that personal information is disclosed in response to legal requests by public authorities where necessary, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Squarespace, Inc. is committed to treating personal information received from the European Region pursuant to the applicable Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the principles thereof (the “DPF Principles”). You can find our certification
here
and you can learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks (as determined based upon the country from which the personal information was received) and DPF Principles by visiting
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Squarespace, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
Our accountability for personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, we may use third parties to process data on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy, and we remain liable if they do so in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If you have a question or complaint you believe to be within the scope of our Data Privacy Frameworks certification, please contact us first at
privacy@squarespace.com
, or using the contact details in the “How to contact us” section below. Any complaint must include a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Squarespace. We'll respond within 45 days.
Any complaint that we can’t resolve directly after 45 days may be resolved by JAMS, which is the independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Data Privacy Frameworks compliance. You can contact JAMS free of charge at
https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution
. JAMS is an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the US.
If your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under the DPF Principles through the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, which is the international division of the American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”) and which is the administrator for the Data Privacy Frameworks binding arbitration program. The administration of all such arbitrations will be in accordance with ICDR-AAA’s applicable dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed (the “ICDR-AAA Rules”). If you are in the EEA or the UK, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules
here
. If you are in Switzerland, please see the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules
here
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, both you and Squarespace agree to the applicable ICDR-AAA Rules relating to mass arbitration filings, including without limitation the
ICDR-AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and Fee Schedules
, but excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.
Any dispute resolution demand or counterclaim, including arbitration demand or counterclaim, asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted and the factual allegations on which those claims are based, and must include proof that the claimant’s data is subject to this Privacy Policy. ICDR-AAA may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. ICDR-AAA has the right to impose sanctions for any claims it determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and any similar standards in other jurisdictions), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant whose data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
Nothing in the Data Privacy Frameworks affects your rights as a data subject to the extent we use any European Commission approved standard data protection clauses for transfers to the US. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and applicable DPF Principles, the applicable DPF Principles shall govern.

When we make changes, we’ll update the “Effective Date” at the top of the Privacy Policy and post it on our sites. If we make material changes to it or the ways we process your information, we’ll notify you (by, for example, prominently posting a notice of the changes on our sites before they take effect or directly sending you a notification).
We encourage you to check back periodically to review this Privacy Policy for any changes since your last visit. This will help ensure you better understand your relationship with us, including the ways we process your information.

Appendix I. Specific Information for California Residents
This Appendix I is only applicable to you if you are a resident of the state of California in the US (“California Residents”) and only applies to Squarespace Controlled Information for which Squarespace is a “Business” (as defined in the CCPA). “CCPA” means the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 - 1798.199), as may be modified from time to time, including by the California Privacy Rights Act. This Appendix I covers Squarespace Controlled Information we collect about California Residents on or through our Services and through other means (such as information collected offline or in person). It does not apply to personal information we collect from individuals in their capacity as job applicants, employees, or independent contractors of Squarespace. As used in this Appendix I, “personal information” shall have the meaning set forth in the CCPA.
If you are a California Resident who is a User and uses the Services to store Customer Controlled Information for which you are a “Business” and Squarespace is a “Service Provider” (as defined in the CCPA), please see our
Data Processing Addendum
for information about how we process Customer Controlled Information.

The only categories of personal information for which we “Share" or “Sell” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (as described in subsection c. below) are non-directly identifying identifiers (e.g., “hashed” email address), commercial transactions, and Internet activity data.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the parties to whom we disclose or share information, please see
Section 5 above
.
For information on how we retain your personal information, please see
Section 8 above
.
b. Your requests
Subject to certain exceptions and restrictions, the CCPA provides California Residents the right to submit requests to a business which has collected their personal information: (i) to provide them with access to the specific pieces and categories of personal information collected by the business about such California Resident, the categories of sources for such information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such information, and the categories of unaffiliated parties to whom such information was disclosed; (ii) to request correction of their inaccurate personal information; and (iii) to delete their personal information (each, a “California Request”). We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete some or all of your information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
If you are a California Resident, please follow the instructions in the
“Your rights and choices” section above
to submit California Requests and please make sure you note that you are a California Resident when you do so. California Residents may designate an authorized agent to make California Requests on their behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a California Request on your behalf, you or your agent must provide proof that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf, such as written authorization signed by you authorizing that agent to act on your behalf. We reserve the right to request additional information from you and/or individuals purporting to be authorized agents, such as when we suspect fraud.
c. Do not sell or share my personal information
California residents may opt out of the "Sale" or “Sharing” of their personal information. The CCPA’s definition of "Sale" includes “Sharing” for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising,” which is defined as targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We only mean this CCPA definition when “share” or “sharing” are capitalized in this Appendix I or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We Share information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. Depending on how you use the Services, we may Share device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies, for such purposes. We do not otherwise “Sell” (as defined in the CCPA) your personal information, and have not engaged in such activity in the twelve (12) months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
If you would like to opt out of Squarespace's Sale or Sharing of your information with third parties for such purposes, you may do so by clicking on the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of this page. Please note that the opt out will only apply to the browser and device you use to opt out.
The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. We collect the following categories of “sensitive personal information”: (i) account log-in and password or other credentials that allow access to your account; and (ii) geolocation information. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the “Global Privacy Control,” which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes. We respond to the Global Privacy Control in California. To opt out of Sale or Sharing, turn on the Global Privacy Control signal in your browser. Please note that the opt out will only apply to the browser and device you use to send the Global Privacy Control signal.
We do not knowingly Sell or Share the personal information of children under 16.
d. We do not discriminate against you
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Squarespace does not discriminate against California Residents for exercising their rights.

Appendix II. Specific Information for Residents of Other US States With An Applicable Data Privacy Law
This Appendix II is only applicable to you if you are a resident of a state other than California with an applicable data privacy law such as Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, and Texas (“Applicable State Residents”) and only applies to Squarespace Controlled Information for which Squarespace is a “Controller” (as defined in an applicable state data privacy law). It does not apply to personal information we collect about you where you are acting as an employee, owner, director, officer or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency. This Appendix II applies to personal information we collect about Applicable State Residents on or through our Services and through other means (such as information collected offline or in person).
In addition to your rights in
Section 6 above
, you can:
ask us to confirm we are processing your personal information; and
opt out of processing or sharing of your personal information for online targeted advertising purposes. If you would like to opt out of Squarespace's use of your information for such purposes, you may do so by clicking on the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of this page.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable state data privacy law. Depending on where you live, if we deny your request to exercise your rights in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, you may contact us at
privacy@squarespace.com
with the subject “Data Privacy Request Appeal” to provide us with details about why you are appealing the decision.
Residents of the state of Colorado may review the table in
Appendix I(a) above
for additional details on how we process Squarespace Controlled Information about you.
