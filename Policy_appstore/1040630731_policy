Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Wildlife Studios at
privacy@wildlifestudios.com
.
THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.
Information Required to Play our Games
. We may collect personal information when you first play one of our games, such as the nickname you choose to display to other players. Some of our games may also ask you your age.
Content Creator program

To apply to be a partner, we collect your full name, channel name on YouTube and/or Twitch, primary and secondary channel links, email address, subscriber/follower count, player ID, age, and optional country/region information and Discord ID. Please review our
Content Partner Privacy Policy

For example, some games include voice chat features, while other games may allow you to upload photos from your device to modify and share through our games.

Although our apps are designed for a general audience, we take additional precautions in our games if we determine that they are targeted to children, such as including a neutral age-gate and disabling some features for kids.
Protecting children’s privacy online is very important to us. Although our Services are designed for a general audience, we take additional steps to limit access to Services that appeal to children based on the player’s age, such as by disabling social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts. We also limit personal information collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has uploaded personal information to our site without your consent, or wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “
Contact Us
” below. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, if applicable.
Third-Party Websites/Applications. The Services may contain links to other websites/applications and other websites/applications may reference or link to our Services. These third-party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our players to read the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact.

Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Wildlife Studios at

THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.
Information Required to Play our Games
. We may collect personal information when you first play one of our games, such as the nickname you choose to display to other players. Some of our games may also ask you your age.
Content Creator program

To apply to be a partner, we collect your full name, channel name on YouTube and/or Twitch, primary and secondary channel links, email address, subscriber/follower count, player ID, age, and optional country/region information and Discord ID. Please review our
Content Partner Privacy Policy
for more details.
Interactive Features
. We and others who use our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., messaging and chat features, including chat audio, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, and social media pages).

For example, some games include voice chat features, while other games may allow you to upload photos from your device to modify and share through our games.
Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered "public," unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other players.

We also limit personal information collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.

us
,
our
) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
The Company is a “data controller” within the meaning of the GDPR. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you. This Applicant Privacy and Data Protection Notice (the Notice) is intended to ensure that you are aware of what personal data we hold in relation to you and how we use that data, in accordance with the GDPR.
For the purposes of this Notice:
GDPR
means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) and any national implementing laws, as amended or updated from time to time;
Group Company
means a company which is a Subsidiary or Holding Company of the Company or any Subsidiary of such Holding Company from time to time (and for this purpose
Subsidiary
and
Holding Company
have the meanings given to them respectively in sections 7 and 8 of the Companies Act 2014).
Please read the following carefully to understand how and why we are using such information and what your rights are under the applicable data protection legislation.
This Notice applies to you because either (i) we have identified you as a potential candidate for future recruitment; and/or (ii) you have applied to work with us (whether as an employee, agency worker, consultant, individual contractor or director); and/or (iii) you have been referred to us for potential employment; and/or (iv) you have reached us or was reached by us through an event sponsored or organized by us. This Notice also applies to third parties whose information you provide to us in connection with our relationship with you (for example, in respect of references). Please ensure that you provide a copy of this Notice to any third parties whose personal data you provide to us.
This Notice does not form part of any offer of employment or contract of employment and does not confer any contractual right on you, or place any contractual obligation on us.
This Notice applies to all personal data collected, maintained, transmitted, stored, retained, or otherwise used (i.e. processed) by us regardless of the media on which that personal data is stored. We may update this Notice at any time and will notify you, where appropriate, in writing of any material changes.
The Company is committed to complying with the GDPR. Any personal information that we hold about you must be:
Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;
Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;
Relevant to the purposes that we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;
Accurate and kept up to date;
Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; and
Kept securely.
‘Personal Data’
is defined as any information relating to a living individual from whom that individual can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We will collect, hold and use the following categories of Personal Data about you as set out in Appendix 1 of this Notice.
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information for the following purposes:
In order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract;
To comply with a legal obligation;
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. In this instance a legitimate interest assessment (LIA) will have been conducted to (i) identify a legitimate interest; (ii) show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and (iii) balance it against your interests, rights and freedoms. You may request a copy of this LIA by contacting privacy@wildlifestudios.com.
In particular, we will hold, process and may disclose personal data provided by you for the following purposes:
Future recruitment to identify potential suitable candidates for particular roles:
i) Having conducted a LIA, the processing of your data is necessary for our legitimate business interest in identifying potential suitable candidates who may be interested in roles which may arise in the future.
ii) Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.
iii) Where we rely on our “legitimate interest” as a reason for processing personal data, we have considered whether those interests are overridden by employees’ rights and freedoms and have concluded that they are not. You have a right to request information on the balancing test we use.
Recruitment/appointment including assessing your job application:
i) This processing of your data is necessary to process job applications submitted by, or on your behalf, and to assist in our determination as to whether to enter into a contract of employment (or engagement) with you.
Collecting any demographic information you choose to provide when you apply for a position through our website.
i) This processing is necessary for our talent acquisition team to learn how best to communicate with you and understand the demographic share of the applicants to our roles.
ii)  We rely on your explicit consent to collect this information. You have the right to revoke this consent at any time – please refer to Your Data Rights below for more information.
iii) Providing this information is entirely voluntary and you can select “I don’t wish to answer” if you would prefer not to respond to each question. This will not affect your hiring process, and any such information provided will not be considered for hiring decision. This information is not shared beyond the talent acquisition team.
Managing health and safety at work and incident reporting, and for exercising our right to defend, respond or conduct legal proceedings:
i) This processing of your data is necessary in order for us to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations.
Sending email marketing to you where you have signed up to our newsletter.
i) This processing is necessary for our legitimate interests in marketing and promoting our business
[JN1]
, and the sending of such emails is based on your prior consent to receive such communications.
ii) Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Information about criminal convictions also warrants a higher level of protection. We will only process data relating to your criminal convictions or involvement in criminal proceedings when permitted by law, or where provided voluntarily by you.
In principle, we do not rely on your consent for data use.
We may, however, from time to time, (i) ask for your consent to use your personal data for a specific purpose; and/or (ii) process your personal data (including “special data”) in order to protect your vital interests or the interests of another. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the data that we would like and the reason we need it. We will also inform you about the fact that you can revoke your consent at any time and how you should do that. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal data and, subject to our data retention policy, we will dispose of your personal data securely.
If you do not provide us with your personal data we may not be able to process your job application or assess your suitability for a particular role, comply with our legal obligations or manage our business. We will tell you when we ask for information which is a statutory or contractual requirement or needed to comply with our legal obligations.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We securely store your personal data, with controlled access to it. Access to personal data (including special data) in both electronic and paper form is restricted to the Greenhouse three site administrators (two based in√ä Brazil and one in the United States), and the Recruiting Lead in Ireland, all of which have a legitimate and justifiable reason to view such data.
Third parties to whom we have provided your personal data will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
We may disclose your personal data to a Group Company including, without limitation, for the following reasons: in order to run global processes; carry out group wide reporting; or take decisions about hiring or promotion.
It may be necessary from time to time for us to disclose personal data to third parties or agents, including without limitation to the following:
Third parties to assist in the administration, processing and management of certain activities pertaining to prospective employees, for example Zoom (to set up online job interviews), Greenhouse (our recruitment platform), Tableau (our business intelligence platform), HackerRank (used for assessment tests of prospective candidates), and DocuSign (for electronic signatures of job offers);
Individuals or companies employed by the Company to carry out specific services, functions or consultancy work including external reference agencies and other financial institutions;
Relatives or legal representatives of prospective employees;
Regulatory bodies to whom we are obliged or required to disclose information including Workplace Relations Commission, Courts and Court-appointed persons;
Legal and medical practitioners;
Potential purchasers or bidders;
Relevant Government departments and agencies; and
Other support service providers necessary to assist the Company with the above.
We will inform you, where appropriate, in advance if we intend to further process or disclose your personal data for a purpose other than the purposes set out above. We take all reasonable steps, as required by law, to ensure the safety, privacy and integrity of such data and information and, where appropriate, enter into contracts with such third parties to protect the privacy and integrity of such data and any information supplied.
The personal data that we collect in relation to you may be transferred to, and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for the purposes described above. Due to the global nature of our business, your personal data may be disclosed to Group Companies outside the EEA, including, in particular, Brazil and United States of America. It may also be processed by personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers who act on our behalf. We will ensure suitable safeguards are in place to protect the privacy and integrity of your personal data in such circumstances including standard contractual clauses under Article 46.2 or adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR. You can obtain information and a copy of documentation pertaining to these safeguards from the Country Manager where applicable.
Data will be stored for as long as required to satisfy the purpose for which the data was collected and used, unless a longer period is necessary for our legal, accounting or reporting obligations or for the exercise or defence of legal claims. In circumstances where we have collected your personal data for future potential roles, we generally retain your data for a period of 1 year. After this period, the data is anonymized.
The Company may retain your name and email address on a cool off list after the initial retention period, for 1 more year, in situations where your recruiting process ended because either you have reached the interview or testing phase, but has not been hired, or the position you have applied to is not being offered anymore; in both cases the Company might find your profile of interest for future opportunities and may retain your data in a cool off list.
The Company may also retain your name and email address in a suppression list, after the 1 year period, in order not to contact you again for a period of 1 more year. The suppression list does not prevent you from applying again to the recruiting process, as it is just used to avoid further recruiting approach from the Company afterwards. Your data will be anonymized at the end of this period.
You have several rights in relation to your personal data under applicable privacy and data protection law, which may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions such as when the processing of your data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for the exercise or defence of legal claims.
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the following rights:
Right to Withdraw Consent
:
If we are processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent, you are entitled to withdraw your consent at any time (see Contact Us below). However, the withdrawal of your consent will not invalidate any processing we carried out prior to your withdrawal and based on your consent.

Personal data
refers to any information or data that can directly or indirectly identify a person. Anonymized data or information from which identity cannot be derived won’t be considered personal data.
Group Company
may refer to either the Holding Company or Subsidiary within Wildlife Studios economic group.
The following notice was devised to apply to all of our Social Media Influencers and Content Partners. Please read it carefully and if you have any question or concerns, please contact us through
privacy@wildlifestudios.com
.
This Privacy Notice is of interest to or applies to you because either (i) we have identified you as a potential candidate for our Partner’s Program; (ii) you have applied for our Partner’s Program; thus we may collect and use your Personal Data in relation to your relationship to us.
This notice also applies to third parties that share your Personal Data with us. Please ensure that you provide a copy of this Notice to any third-party whose Personal Data you share with us.
This Notice details how we may collect, maintain, transmit, store or otherwise use your Personal Data.. We may update this Notice at any time and will notify you, where appropriate, in writing of any material changes.
We will collect only the necessary Personal Data to conduct the Partner’s Program, and that includes:
(i) Your email;
(ii) Social Media profiles’ information;
(iii) Player ID from the applicable Wildlife game;
(iv) Full name;
(v) Your address;
(vi) Bank information, when applicable;
(vii) Nationality, to comply with US Export Controls obligations.
As you can see, all the information we will collect about you refers essentially to contact information, which we need to contact you, as well as in-game identification, which we might use to deliver in-app items. Also, it is important to note that we will only collect your address information if it is necessary to deliver items to you.
All of your Personal Data will be collected and processed under an applicable legal basis, as described by the law. We may rely on the following legal basis to process your Personal Data:
(i) For the performance of a contract, or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, when applicable;

(iv) Where you have consented to participate in this program.

We may disclose your Personal Data to a Group Company, as specified at the beginning of this document, without limitation, to run global processes, such as, but not limited to, evaluating the effectiveness of the Partner Program.
As not all Group Companies are inside the European Economic Area (EEA), this means your Personal Data may be transferred to other countries, in particular, Brazil, USA, Argentina and Uruguay.
We may share Personal Data with third parties to perform the partnership with you, such as but not limited, to host your Personal Data on web servers, to communicate with you, collect electronic signature requests.

We will keep your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data was collected and is processed, or if legal circumstances require us to do so, such as, but not limited to, the exercise or defence of legal claims. Once the retention period expires we will delete or anonymize your personal data.
As Applicable Privacy Laws state, you are entitled to several rights when it comes to your Personal Data, as long as they are not restricted by any legal obligations. Your rights are the following:

sensitive information
on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.

about the inferences we may make, including as to

and how we use them.
2.1 Services
Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their
settings
, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can
choose
whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have
choices
about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your
settings
, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a
social action
, used a feature, made new connections or were
mentioned in the news
.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a
specific task
) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
interested
in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your
settings
allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

2.2 Premium Services
Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you
opt-out
. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history.

TeamLink
and
LinkedIn Pages
(e.g., content analytics and followers).
2.3 Communications
We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications.

We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn
tag
on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,
groups
participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
Information from advertising
partners
, vendors and
publishers
; and
Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).

about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
Learn more
about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our
European Regional Privacy Notice
.
We will show you ads called
sponsored content
which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your
settings
, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
Ad Choices
You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings
can be found here
. For Visitors,
the setting is here
.
Info to Ad Providers
We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
2.5 Marketing
We promote our Services to you and others.
In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
2.6 Developing Services and Research
We develop our Services and conduct research
Service Development
We use data, including public feedback, to conduct
research
and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
Other Research
We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these
jobs
and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under
controls
that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to
researchers
to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
Surveys
Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may
opt-out
of survey invitations.
2.7 Customer Support
We use data to help you and fix problems.
We use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).
2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You
We use data to generate insights that do not identify you.
We use your
data
to perform analytics to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our Members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on (e.g., for basic business reporting to support billing and budget management or, subject to your
settings
, for reports to advertisers who may use them to inform their advertising campaigns), to show Members' information about engagement with a
post
or LinkedIn
Page
, to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights, or to understand usage of our services.
2.9 Security and Investigations
We use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.
We and our Affiliates, including Microsoft, may use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of the law, our
User Agreement
and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors, company, Affiliates, or others.
Social Action
E.g. like, comment, follow, share
Partners
Partners include ad networks, exchanges and others
3. How We Share Information
3.1 Our Services
Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
Profile
Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your
settings
, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our
Help Center
, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their
usage of our Services
, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
settings
). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
In a
group
, posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your
settings
.
Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your
settings
where applicable.
Subject to your
settings
, we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you
choices
about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
Enterprise Accounts
Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
Subject to your
settings
, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
3.2 Communication Archival
Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
3.3 Others’ Services
You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
Subject to your
settings
, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may
revoke
the link with such accounts.
The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages)
may be available to them on other services
. For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your
settings
), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
3.4 Related Services
We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services.
Where allowed
, we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
3.5 Service Providers
We may use others to help us with our Services.
We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
3.6 Legal Disclosures
We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our
Data Request Guidelines
and
Transparency Report
.
3.7 Change in Control or Sale
We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
4. Your Choices & Obligations
4.1 Data Retention
We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have
restricted
your account for breach of our
Professional Community Policies
), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to "unsubscribe" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search tools) until they refresh their cache.

Any other Personal Data We were processing relating to Our Customer, Tester and/or Users of that Hotjar account will be deleted permanently within thirty (30) calendar days. This does not apply to any Personal Data collected as part of Customer research within the Engage Product. To maintian the quality of the research data, any research-related Personal Data may need to be kept for a reasonably required time.
We may use Personal Data and other Data about Our Customers, Users and/or Testers (including but not limited to demographic information, location information, information about the computer or device from which they access Our Platform) to create, wherever possible, anonymized and aggregated information and analytics. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
The information We collect from Our Customers, Users and/or Testers is disclosed only in accordance with the Agreement and the Applicable Law.
Personal Data collected from Engage Product Testers
THIS SECTION APPLIES ONLY TO THE REGISTERED TESTERS OF OUR ENGAGE PRODUCT
When a Tester signs up to the Engage Product, we will ask them to share some Personal Data with Us to create a Tester profile. The Tester profile information will be revealed to Hotjar and Our Customers, who may invite you to usability study interviews ("
Interviews
"). The Engage Product has been built to connect Testers with the best-matched Customers for their Interviews. Better matches means happier Customers and more payouts for Testers. We analyse the data Testers provide Us with, along with the information about the Tester’s use of Our Platform, to suggest a good Interview match.
We collect and process Tester Personal Data to allow Testers to participate in Customer research, as well as for database management, managing contacts and sending messages, analytics, managing Our hosting and backend infrastructure, paying Testers for their service, Tester registration and authentication and displaying content from external platforms.
The data categories we will ask Testers to provide in order to build the Tester profile may include but are not limited to, name, age, country of residence, educational background, profession, marital status, phone number and other registration information. This information allows us to effectively match Testers with the right Customers. Testers may also optionally upload an avatar or enter their gender, but can remove this at any time. If a Tester deletes their account, their profile data will be removed too. Depending on the context, the legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We will also collect information that relates to how Testers use Our Platform. The categories of Personal Data relating to this include but are not limited to timezone, broad location (town or district), web browser, operating system and the device used, referral sources, email engagement data, data on how you use the Engage Product (including last login date and frequency) and account signup date. This information allows Us to personalize the Engage Product to Testers’ needs and to improve Our Engage Product. We do not collect precise, real-time information about the location of a Tester’s device. We delete (or anonymize) such Tester Personal Data as soon as you cancel your account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
On an entirely voluntary basis, Testers may choose to connect their social media account with their Tester profile. This will grant Us read-only access to their social media account and we will store their social media account ID, along with a secure 'access key' that these social media companies provide to Us. If Tester grants Us access, we may also process their email address that is associated with the social media account, name, profile picture, gender and age range, which we may use to enhance Tester profile data on the Engage Product. We use social media account data as a 'quality signal' to confirm that the Engage Product account belongs to a real person and therefore, sharing of social account data may affect the number of Interview invitations a Tester receives. We will never post content to a Tester’s social profile without their permission and we will never request or access their private messages on these accounts. Testers can choose to disconnect their social media accounts at any time, which will prevent Us from being able to access them. Social media account data will also be deleted if you choose to delete your Hotjar account. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
In order to be able to remunerate Our Testers we will process payment related information that Testers share with Us such as PayPal email address, residential address, etc.. We may also need to keep a history of payments made to Testers. This is needed to comply with accounting and legal rules. This data may be kept up to seven (7) years. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Hotjar’s use of Personal Data
Access and Disclosure to Third Parties
We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain technical data analysis, processing and/or storage offerings (e.g., IT and related services). These Third Party service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection and security standards. We only share data with them that is required for the services offered and We contractually bind them to keep any information We share with them as confidential and to process Personal Data only according to Our instructions. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
In addition to services providers, other categories of Third Parties may include:
Vendors/public institutions.
To the extent that this is necessary in order to make use of certain services requiring special expertise (such as legal, accounting or auditing services) We may share Personal Data with vendors of such services or public institutions that offer them (e.g. courts). The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.
If We are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then Data may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract. The legal basis for such processing would be Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Other than the cases mentioned above, We will only transfer Personal Data to Third Parties without express consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or if We are obliged to do so by statutory law or by instruction from a public authority or court as outlined in Our

Marketing Purposes

Potential new Customers or Testers that appear to have shared interests or similar demographics.
The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
We do this by sharing Personal Data with Third Party marketing platforms that have high privacy and confidentiality standards and which have gone through a legal and security review by Hotjar. This ensures that these Third Parties cannot do anything with the Personal Data We provide them other than use it for the express purpose of providing Us with the marketing services We contract them for.
This Personal Data is only shared with these Third Parties through secure and encrypted means. If you wish to opt out of this processing activity, please contact Us at
dpo@hotjar.com

Benchmarking
Hotjar reserves the right to use and retain Data in a de-identified and/or aggregated form to improve Our Site and/or Platform and for statistical and benchmarking purposes, including enabling comparisons within the same industry to enhance the insights collected through Our Site and Platform. Benchmarks look at all collected metrics and compare them to others of the same nature. These de-identified and/or aggregated benchmarks may be published and shared publicly within Our Platform or in the form of other content We publish which may show a summary of results for a certain category or question type.
No Data which can individually identify Our Customers, or their end-users, Our Users or Our Testers will ever be shown in this statistical or benchmark data.
The legal basis for aggregating/anonymizing this Personal Data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Intra-group sharing of User and visitor Data
Hotjar is part of the Content Square SAS group (“
Contentsquare
”) which is headquartered in Paris, France. In the course of our normal operations, Hotjar may share Data (e.g. name and contact details, etc.) of Users of Hotjar accounts, Testers, and visitors of Our Site (hotjar.com) with Contentsquare.
The purpose of sharing this Data is to pursue synergies in sales and marketing, which is in both Hotjar’s and Contentsquare’s legitimate commercial interests. The legal basis of this Data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Hotjar and Contentsquare are jointly responsible for these processing activities (so-called joint controllership). If you would like more information in this regard or would like to exercise your rights as described in this Privacy Policy, please contact Us at dpo@hotjar.com.

Our Pricing Page,
Personal Data will be retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which We originally collected it or to provide Our Platform, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, and enforce Our Agreement. We may also retain information as required by Applicable Law.
International Transfers of Personal Data
In most cases, Personal Data We collect is stored in the EU. However, in some limited cases, customer information may be accessed from, or other Personal Data (e.g., email, etc.) may be transferred outside of the EU. These countries may have different data protection laws. Hotjar endeavors to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place requiring that Personal Data will remain protected. Hotjar has concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with entities who We share Personal Data with outside of the EU. Further details about this can be found in Our article on
Data Storage
.

Send the Signal
Your browser will send the
GPC
signal to websites you visit.
Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.
Get Involved
GPC
lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC
is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.
View Full Spec
Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Wildlife Studios is a mobile gaming company specializing in online, free-to-play games.
We know that privacy is important to you, and also that not everyone has time to read a lengthy privacy policy. So, in addition to the formal legal disclosures, we’ve added clear and concise summaries to each section to help you better understand how we collect, use, process, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Wildlife Studios at
privacy@wildlifestudios.com
.
THE BOTTOM LINE:
• We’re in the business of making great games. In addition to the information you give us directly, such as your username (and email address if you reach out to support), we also collect information about your device and how you play our games to make them better. Although we do have third-party ads in some of our games, you have control over what types of information our advertising partners can access.
• Some of our games have social features, but we only use this social data to operate our service. We may need to look at the things you post, for instance, to enforce our Terms of Service or comply with our legal obligations. But we don’t use your chat history for advertising purposes.
This policy covers your player data, wherever we may collect it. You should only use our services if you are OK with this policy, which we do update from time to time.
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Wildlife Studios (collectively “Wildlife Studios,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including on our websites, mobile applications (“apps”), and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, apps, and other offerings are collectively referred to here as the “Services.”
Changes to our Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that if you continue to use our Services after we make changes, it will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy.
Like most online mobile game developers, our apps collect information about you to make our games better. This includes the nickname you choose to show other players, as well as information we may collect automatically from your device, or from third-party services (like Facebook, Apple, or Google) you choose to connect with.
The types of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and what the law may require. Generally speaking, we collect personal information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations. See below for more details on each type of information.
We do our best to only ask you for the information we need to run our games well. For example, if you want to engage with other players using voice chat for some games, we need to access your microphone. We may collect other information from you in other situations as well, like when you attend in-person events or sign up for optional promotions or programs (such as content partner programs).
We may collect personal information that you provide to us.
Information Required to Play our Games
. We may collect personal information when you first play one of our games, such as the nickname you choose to display to other players. Some of our games may also ask you your age.
Content Creator program

To apply to be a partner, we collect your full name, channel name on YouTube and/or Twitch, primary and secondary channel links, email address, subscriber/follower count, player ID, age, and optional country/region information and Discord ID. Please review our
Content Partner Privacy Policy
for more details.
Interactive Features
. We and others who use our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., messaging and chat features, including chat audio, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, and social media pages). Some games may request access to your microphone and/or photo library to enable certain optional social features. For example, some games include voice chat features, while other games may allow you to upload photos from your device to modify and share through our games.
Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered "public," unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other players.

,” our Services may allow you to share personal information through your interactions with other players.
Advertising Partners
. We may share your personal information with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Services to collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering and measuring the effectiveness of personalized advertisements served to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “personalized advertising.”
APIs/SDKs
. We may use third-party application program interfaces (“APIs”) and software development kits (“SDKs”) as part of the functionality of our Services. If you have additional questions about our use of third-party APIs/SDKs, please contact us as set forth in “
Contact Us

We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.
If we are involved in an actual or proposed merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred in connection with such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.
You have the power to control your own information. In addition to the automated controls on your various devices, you can also exercise your data-related rights directly with us. For example, depending on the laws where you live, you may ask us to delete your information, to make changes to your information, or request a copy of your data in a portable format. If you would like to make any of these requests, or just want to know more about your rights, you can contact us by submitting a request using our
webform
, or reach out to us directly at

Network Advertising Initiative
,

“Do Not Track” / “Global Privacy Control.”
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Additionally, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which you can learn more about at
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as a Do Not Sell request where required under applicable law, and we will also interpret it as a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising for residents of the European Economic Area, the UK, China and Brazil.

Subject to applicable law, if you are a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, or Colorado, you may have the following rights:
To Know and Access
: to obtain a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to Personal Information relating to you, and not to any other player.)
Deletion
: to request that we delete your Personal Information. This right may be limited to the extent that we are permitted or required by applicable law to retain certain information. (Note that if you request deletion of your Personal Information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you decide to use or access the Services again, we may consider this a new account, and may collect Personal Information associated with that account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
Opt-Out of “Sale” and Certain Sharing Practices
: you have the right to opt-out of certain information sharing practices with third parties who do not act as our service providers. In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively, “personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can opt out of said sharing by using our
webform
, or by contacting us as
set forth in “Contact Us” below
.
Correction

We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you exercise any of the rights listed above.
Verification and Appeal Process
: We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.
If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.
Authorized Agent
: Depending on where you live, you may have the right to use an authorized agent on their behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a player to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the player, and have sufficient access to that player’s laptop, desktop, or mobile device to exercise that player’s right digitally. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of one of our players, then you can make a request on the player’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below in the “
Contact Us
” section: Such requests must include the following information: (1) a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s full name, address, telephone number and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us, that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority; and (2) a certificate of good standing with your state of organization.  Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us.  The email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority with the consumer.
Refer-a-Friend, Promotions, and Similar Incentive Programs

We may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide Personal Information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your Personal Information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us as described in “
Contact Us”
