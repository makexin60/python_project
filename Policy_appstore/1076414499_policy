Case study
WeatherKit is a beautiful, design-oriented weather app for iOS.
Launched as Aerium in 2015, WeatherKit has been featured on the App Store multiple times and has been downloaded over 280.000 times. We designed and developed the app from the ground up, including the backend microservices that sent over 10 million Rain Alerts. We can neither confirm nor deny that we have an upcoming update.
