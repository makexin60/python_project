It alrigh
The app itself looks quite Intresting for kids. But when you begin to play it it actually gets very addictive!!! I recommend this game to anyone that wants to do nothing but just look after a horse!! LOL

Has promise but sloppy menu's hurt it.
This game can be a really good horse racing game. In between races you do the exact same things, feed horse, gallop.. Rinse and repeat. The races are too difficult when you race the horse. The lack of a tutorial on how to race well hurts the enjoyment factor. You will win 1 in 10 races. And when you are being forced to pay for coins because you will run out because you can't win races is a money grabbing idea. Nobody downloads this game to hire a jockey to race. That isn't fun. Change some mechanics to this game and you will have a great game. 2*, and I'm being generous.
