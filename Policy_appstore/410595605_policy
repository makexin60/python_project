Wolfram Privacy Policy
Wolfram understands your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly. This policy explains how the information you provide is collected and used, as well as your rights in connection to your information under applicable laws.
What Information Do We Collect?
We may collect both Personal Information (PI) and non-Personal Information (non-PI) about you through your experience on our websites, from your use of our services and products and via other voluntary contact with you (collectively "Services").
The PI we collect through our Services primarily consists of information you submit to us. Because participation in our Services is voluntary, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information. The following are categories of PI we have collected in the past 12 months:
Identifiers
Examples include: a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number or other similar identifiers
Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
Examples include: a name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information or health insurance information. Some PI included in this category may overlap with other categories.
Internet or other similar network activity
Examples include: browsing history, search history, or information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application or advertisement
Geolocation data
Physical location only
Sensory data
Audio, electronic and visual only
Professional or employment-related information
Examples include: current or past job history or performance evaluations
In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we receive some additional PI and non-PI whenever you interact with our Services online, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, referral URLs and other data automatically supplied by most common web browsers.
We may also collect information from third-party sites, as described below in
What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?
How Is Your Information Used?
The PI we obtain from users, site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our Services. Non-PI collected about you through your experience, queries and feedback is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our Services and how we might improve the collective experience. Except as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access our Services for internal reporting, diagnostic analysis and security purposes only.
Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects the computations or outputs provided by our Services for such things as default currency and units of measure based on what country you are in. Your browser type may be used to optimize your display, for example, on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser. Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.
If you provide your email address to us, we may email you in response, as well as notify you of other offers or Services that may be of interest. When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain that communication to respond to you and improve our Services. If at any time you want to stop receiving communication from us, please click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email message from us, or contact our Customer Support
online
or by phone at 1-800-WOLFRAM. However, please note that we may still contact you with transactional communications associated with any software or service agreements you have with us or in direct response to any communication you send us.
Disclosures of Your Information
We do not sell, rent, trade or lease your information to third parties, and have not done so in the past 12 months. Any information we share shall be subject to the parameters associated with your requested Services and preferences.
When we share PI, we require the recipient to protect your PI in compliance with the law, including keeping the PI confidential and not using it for any purpose except the specific purpose of performing our Services and only within the direct business relationship with Wolfram. Wolfram may share information with affiliates, partners, service providers, authorized resellers and distributors, and relevant third parties in order to fulfill the limited purposes described herein.
In the past 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of PI for a business purpose:
Identifiers
California Customer Records PI categories
Internet or other similar network activity
We disclose your PI for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:
Our affiliates
Service providers
Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your PI in connection with products or Services we provide to you
Any collected information (PI and non-PI) associated with your use of our Services may also be subject to disclosure to government authorities or other authorized third parties pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.
We may also preserve, use or disclose your information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and related agreements; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, including suspiciously high-volume use of our Services; to respond to support requests; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others.
What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?
When you use our Services to connect to or access data from a third-party site ("TPS"), including but not limited to social networking sites, we may collect PI about you from any TPS profile for which you give our Services access credentials.
By authorizing these Services to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, to collect, store and use any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow our Services to access through the TPS application programming interface ("API").
Because the linkage between any TPS and our Services is completely voluntary and our Services' abilities to access your information at the TPS require that linkage, and any information transmitted is controlled by your privacy settings at the TPS, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.
Links to Third-Party Websites
From time to time, our Services may contain links to other websites. We do not exercise any control over these websites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content. We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when following links from our Services. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Services.
Cookies
When you visit our websites, they, like most websites, send one or more cookies—small identifiers—to your computer that store information about your session and preferences as well as information that can help improve our Services. While we do use strictly necessary and functional cookies for basic site functionality, as well as security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose in using all other cookies is to enhance and improve your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends. We utilize the following types of cookies:
Default cookies: These strictly necessary and functional cookies support and facilitate the provision of Services that you have requested on our websites, and may enable enhanced features.
Additional cookies: These cookies collect information that we utilize to support the measurement of our websites. On specific sites, Wolfram may use third-party cookies when working with outside partners for analytics and to optimize delivery of information that may be of interest to you. We do not have access to read or write such third-party cookies, nor do we directly control the manner in which they may be used.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but can typically be configured to block all cookies or block all third-party cookies. Please be aware that our websites may not have full functionality for you if your browser is set to block some or all cookies. Depending on your location, you may also be prompted to provide your consent to all cookies, other than strictly necessary and functional cookies, each time you visit our websites. Any information about you collected by us is retained and protected in accordance with the laws governing your location.
To opt out of cookies that allow information to be delivered to you, such as targeted (or "interest-based") advertising, via third-party ad groups we may work with, there are options for controlling the ads you receive. Please note, however, that opting out does not prevent you from seeing the ads; it only makes them less relevant or tailored to your interests. One way you may opt out can be found at the National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt Out website
here
.
Security
We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our Services. These include precautions to safeguard your PI against loss, theft and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
Despite our efforts to protect your PI, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet may be intercepted. Your use of our Services constitutes an acceptance of such risk.
Accessing Our Data Servers
Various Wolfram Services offer some functionality for which they must access our data servers through the internet. When they do so, our data servers receive information similar to what our web servers receive when you visit our websites, as well as various Service-specific identifying information.
Specifically, using Wolfram|Alpha, or utilizing the Wolfram|Alpha functionality within other Services, will trigger the collection of information about the specific query. Some queries may require collecting additional information, such as session information covering the history of Wolfram Mathematica evaluations or the content of Wolfram Finance Platform notebooks containing the Wolfram|Alpha query.
You can choose to prevent these Services from accessing our servers by disconnecting from the internet or by using the Internet & Mail Settings in the Help menu to tell the Service not to connect to the internet. If you choose not to allow these Services to access our servers, our Services will not be able to perform certain functions.
Under normal circumstances, we will never release information on accesses to our servers. We may, however, release information as described above in
Disclosures of Your Information
.
Accessing Our Services from Third-Party Sources
This section is only applicable to Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Cloud:
These Services may additionally be accessed through web widgets, scripts or gadgets that are embedded on third-party sites. If you choose to access these Services via such tools, then depending on the third-party technology, your PI and input may be passed on to the third party's servers prior to being processed by our Services.
Data Retention and the GDPR
We collect and hold personal data about our customers, users and enthusiasts, employees and others in the European Union who access our resources and services in a manner consistent with the lawful bases as outlined in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Please see the
Data Retention Policy Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies
, which outlines our GDPR compliance in collecting, processing and using your personal data. It also describes how you can contact us to review any personal data and withdraw any consent you have given us to store it.
California Residents
Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, certain rights with respect to our collection of their PI. If you are a California resident, please see the
CCPA Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies
. It outlines how you may contact us to exercise your rights under California law. Please note that you must verify your identity before further action is taken.
Japan Residents
Wolfram Research Asia Ltd. and its wholly related corporate affiliate, Wolfram Research, Inc., which is located in the United States, along with all other Wolfram corporations worldwide, are committed to honoring the privacy rights as identified in the
Act on the Protection of Personal Information
(APPI) and the
Law Concerning the Proper Transmission of Specified Electronic Mail
(Anti-spam Law).
Wolfram Research Asia Limited and/or Wolfram Research, Inc. may obtain email addresses listed within websites owned and operated by your institution with which Wolfram has a preexisting business relationship. Accordingly, an email may be sent with the singular purpose of advising the recipient of the existence of this business relationship and benefits and support the recipient has access to.
Our Policy toward Children
Wolfram's Services are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect PI from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with PI without their consent, they should contact us at
myprivacy@wolfram.com
. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PI, we will delete such information from our files.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future. Any such updates or
            modifications shall be effective immediately upon their announcement. Please refer often to this
            document
online
for the latest information.
Questions, Concerns and More Information

CCPA Addendum to Wolfram’s Privacy Policies: Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Your Rights and Choices
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal 
            Information ("PI"). This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of 
            your PI over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer 
            request, we will disclose to you:
The categories of PI we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the PI we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that PI.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that PI.
The specific pieces of PI we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
If we disclosed your PI for a business purpose, identifying the PI categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your PI that we collected from you 
            and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, 
            we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your PI from our records, unless 
            an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the PI, provide a good or service 
                that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business 
                relationship with you or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents; protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity; or 
                prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or 
                exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546
seq.
).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest 
                that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may 
                likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided 
                informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your 
                relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in 
                which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability and deletion rights described in the Access to Specific Information 
            and Data Portability Rights and Deletion Request Rights sections, please submit a verifiable consumer 
            request to us by either:
Calling us at 1-800-WOLFRAM (965-3726).
Emailing us at
myprivacy@wolfram.com
.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your 
            behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your PI. You may also make a 
            verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month 
            period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we 
                collected PI or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and 
                respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your 
            identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PI relates to you. Making a 
            verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use PI 
            provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make 
            the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more 
            time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an 
            account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, 
            we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will 
            only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we 
            provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability 
            requests, we will select a format to provide your PI that is readily useable and should 
            allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, 
            repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we 
            made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, 
            we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or 
                other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or 
                quality of goods or services.
Changes to Our Privacy Notice
We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes 
            to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our website home page.
Contact Information
If you have any questions or comments about this notice, our Privacy Statement, the ways in which we 
            collect and use your PI, or your choices and rights regarding such use or wish to exercise 
            your rights under California law, please do not hesitate to contact us at:

Sub-policy 2

Wolfram Privacy Policy
Wolfram understands your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly. This policy explains how the information you provide is collected and used, as well as your rights in connection to your information under applicable laws.
What Information Do We Collect?
We may collect both Personal Information (PI) and non-Personal Information (non-PI) about you through your experience on our websites, from your use of our services and products and via other voluntary contact with you (collectively "Services").
The PI we collect through our Services primarily consists of information you submit to us. Because participation in our Services is voluntary, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information. The following are categories of PI we have collected in the past 12 months:
Identifiers
Examples include: a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number or other similar identifiers
Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
Examples include: a name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information or health insurance information. Some PI included in this category may overlap with other categories.
Internet or other similar network activity
Examples include: browsing history, search history, or information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application or advertisement
Geolocation data
Physical location only
Sensory data
Audio, electronic and visual only
Professional or employment-related information
Examples include: current or past job history or performance evaluations
In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we receive some additional PI and non-PI whenever you interact with our Services online, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, referral URLs and other data automatically supplied by most common web browsers.
We may also collect information from third-party sites, as described below in
What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?
How Is Your Information Used?
The PI we obtain from users, site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our Services. Non-PI collected about you through your experience, queries and feedback is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our Services and how we might improve the collective experience. Except as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access our Services for internal reporting, diagnostic analysis and security purposes only.
Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects the computations or outputs provided by our Services for such things as default currency and units of measure based on what country you are in. Your browser type may be used to optimize your display, for example, on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser. Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.
If you provide your email address to us, we may email you in response, as well as notify you of other offers or Services that may be of interest. When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain that communication to respond to you and improve our Services. If at any time you want to stop receiving communication from us, please click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email message from us, or contact our Customer Support
online
or by phone at 1-800-WOLFRAM. However, please note that we may still contact you with transactional communications associated with any software or service agreements you have with us or in direct response to any communication you send us.
Disclosures of Your Information
We do not sell, rent, trade or lease your information to third parties, and have not done so in the past 12 months. Any information we share shall be subject to the parameters associated with your requested Services and preferences.
When we share PI, we require the recipient to protect your PI in compliance with the law, including keeping the PI confidential and not using it for any purpose except the specific purpose of performing our Services and only within the direct business relationship with Wolfram. Wolfram may share information with affiliates, partners, service providers, authorized resellers and distributors, and relevant third parties in order to fulfill the limited purposes described herein.
In the past 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of PI for a business purpose:
Identifiers
California Customer Records PI categories
Internet or other similar network activity
We disclose your PI for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:
Our affiliates
Service providers
Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your PI in connection with products or Services we provide to you
Any collected information (PI and non-PI) associated with your use of our Services may also be subject to disclosure to government authorities or other authorized third parties pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.
We may also preserve, use or disclose your information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and related agreements; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, including suspiciously high-volume use of our Services; to respond to support requests; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others.
What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?
When you use our Services to connect to or access data from a third-party site ("TPS"), including but not limited to social networking sites, we may collect PI about you from any TPS profile for which you give our Services access credentials.
By authorizing these Services to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, to collect, store and use any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow our Services to access through the TPS application programming interface ("API").
Because the linkage between any TPS and our Services is completely voluntary and our Services' abilities to access your information at the TPS require that linkage, and any information transmitted is controlled by your privacy settings at the TPS, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.
Links to Third-Party Websites
From time to time, our Services may contain links to other websites. We do not exercise any control over these websites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content. We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when following links from our Services. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Services.
Cookies
When you visit our websites, they, like most websites, send one or more cookies—small identifiers—to your computer that store information about your session and preferences as well as information that can help improve our Services. While we do use strictly necessary and functional cookies for basic site functionality, as well as security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose in using all other cookies is to enhance and improve your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends. We utilize the following types of cookies:
Default cookies: These strictly necessary and functional cookies support and facilitate the provision of Services that you have requested on our websites, and may enable enhanced features.
Additional cookies: These cookies collect information that we utilize to support the measurement of our websites. On specific sites, Wolfram may use third-party cookies when working with outside partners for analytics and to optimize delivery of information that may be of interest to you. We do not have access to read or write such third-party cookies, nor do we directly control the manner in which they may be used.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but can typically be configured to block all cookies or block all third-party cookies. Please be aware that our websites may not have full functionality for you if your browser is set to block some or all cookies. Depending on your location, you may also be prompted to provide your consent to all cookies, other than strictly necessary and functional cookies, each time you visit our websites. Any information about you collected by us is retained and protected in accordance with the laws governing your location.
To opt out of cookies that allow information to be delivered to you, such as targeted (or "interest-based") advertising, via third-party ad groups we may work with, there are options for controlling the ads you receive. Please note, however, that opting out does not prevent you from seeing the ads; it only makes them less relevant or tailored to your interests. One way you may opt out can be found at the National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt Out website
here
.
Security
We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our Services. These include precautions to safeguard your PI against loss, theft and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
Despite our efforts to protect your PI, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet may be intercepted. Your use of our Services constitutes an acceptance of such risk.
Accessing Our Data Servers
Various Wolfram Services offer some functionality for which they must access our data servers through the internet. When they do so, our data servers receive information similar to what our web servers receive when you visit our websites, as well as various Service-specific identifying information.
Specifically, using Wolfram|Alpha, or utilizing the Wolfram|Alpha functionality within other Services, will trigger the collection of information about the specific query. Some queries may require collecting additional information, such as session information covering the history of Wolfram Mathematica evaluations or the content of Wolfram Finance Platform notebooks containing the Wolfram|Alpha query.
You can choose to prevent these Services from accessing our servers by disconnecting from the internet or by using the Internet & Mail Settings in the Help menu to tell the Service not to connect to the internet. If you choose not to allow these Services to access our servers, our Services will not be able to perform certain functions.
Under normal circumstances, we will never release information on accesses to our servers. We may, however, release information as described above in
Disclosures of Your Information
.
Accessing Our Services from Third-Party Sources
This section is only applicable to Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Cloud:
These Services may additionally be accessed through web widgets, scripts or gadgets that are embedded on third-party sites. If you choose to access these Services via such tools, then depending on the third-party technology, your PI and input may be passed on to the third party's servers prior to being processed by our Services.
Data Retention and the GDPR
We collect and hold personal data about our customers, users and enthusiasts, employees and others in the European Union who access our resources and services in a manner consistent with the lawful bases as outlined in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Please see the
Data Retention Policy Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies
, which outlines our GDPR compliance in collecting, processing and using your personal data. It also describes how you can contact us to review any personal data and withdraw any consent you have given us to store it.
California Residents
Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, certain rights with respect to our collection of their PI. If you are a California resident, please see the
CCPA Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies
. It outlines how you may contact us to exercise your rights under California law. Please note that you must verify your identity before further action is taken.
Japan Residents
Wolfram Research Asia Ltd. and its wholly related corporate affiliate, Wolfram Research, Inc., which is located in the United States, along with all other Wolfram corporations worldwide, are committed to honoring the privacy rights as identified in the
Act on the Protection of Personal Information
(APPI) and the
Law Concerning the Proper Transmission of Specified Electronic Mail
(Anti-spam Law).
Wolfram Research Asia Limited and/or Wolfram Research, Inc. may obtain email addresses listed within websites owned and operated by your institution with which Wolfram has a preexisting business relationship. Accordingly, an email may be sent with the singular purpose of advising the recipient of the existence of this business relationship and benefits and support the recipient has access to.
Our Policy toward Children
Wolfram's Services are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect PI from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with PI without their consent, they should contact us at
myprivacy@wolfram.com
. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PI, we will delete such information from our files.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future. Any such updates or
            modifications shall be effective immediately upon their announcement. Please refer often to this
            document
online
for the latest information.
