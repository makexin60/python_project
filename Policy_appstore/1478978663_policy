PRIVACY POLICY
1. Introduction
Thank you for using our mobile and web apps! Our goal is to make your experience as simple, private, and useful as possible without collecting unnecessary data for some future use or to share with other entities. This approach is very important to us, and we're committed to protecting your privacy.
2. Information We Collect
We intentionally do not collect any personally identifiable information, such as your name or phone number. The only information we collect is your email address, which is manually collected for the sole purpose of sending you your medical information. All images are stored on your device unless you choose to submit them to a doctor. Any submission to a doctor is also part of your account. This is another measure we use to keep you in control of your information.
3. Our Unique Approach
We believe in respecting your privacy, which is why we intentionally do not collect any extra data beyond what is necessary to provide you with our service. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to providing you with a safe and secure experience.
4. Data Protection
We do not share your personal information with third parties, nor do we spam our users. We understand the importance of data protection and are committed to keeping your information safe and secure. We process your personal information in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
As a data controller, we ensure that all processing of personal data is done in compliance with GDPR principles. We only collect and process personal data where it is necessary for us to perform our obligations or where we have a legitimate interest to do so. We ensure that all personal data we collect is accurate, kept up to date, and is not kept longer than necessary. We also take appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal data.
You have the right to access your personal data, have it corrected, and have it deleted. You can also object to the processing of your personal data or request that the processing of your personal data is restricted. If you have any questions or concerns about how we process your personal data, please contact us at [insert your contact information].
5. Third-Party Services
We use Firebase for some aspects of our service, Stripe for payments, and Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our app. However, we may remove Google Analytics in the future to further protect your privacy. We also use cloud database hosting, AWS, and Heroku. If you are interested in learning about the privacy policies of these services, please refer to their respective websites. We do not store credit card information, as all payments are processed through our payment provider with the highest levels of security.
6. Account Deletion
We do not want to keep any additional data that might impact your privacy, so if you would like to delete your information, including any submissions to a doctor, simply send us an email to request account deletion. Your account is essentially just your email address and an encrypted password.
7. Anonymized Images
We may use anonymized images submitted by users to improve our AI models.
8. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website. Your continued use of our app after any changes indicates your agreement with the updated Privacy Policy.
9. GDPR Compliance
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding your personal information. You have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, and object to the processing of your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided in Section 9.
10. California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information we have collected about you, the right to request deletion of your personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided in Section 11.
