International transfers
We may transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (the “
EEA
”).
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available upon request by
contacting us.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 10 below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
(1)
To request access
to personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data held about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it
(2)
To request correction
of the personal data that we hold. This enables the correction of any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data provided to us.
(3)
To request erasure
of personal data. This enables the deletion or removal personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. A request can also be made for deletion or removal of personal data where the right to object to processing has been successfully exercised (see below), where we may have processed information unlawfully or where we are required to erase personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with requests of erasure for specific legal reasons with notification of this given, if applicable, at the time of any request.
(4)
To object to processing
of personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
(5)
To request restriction of processing
of personal data. This enables a request to be made to us to suspend the processing of personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it because it is needed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you objected to use of data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
(6)
To request the transfer
of personal data back to whom it belongs or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which we were given consent to use.
(7)
To withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal of consent. If consent is withdrawn, we will not be able to provide our services. We will advise you of this at the time of the withdrawal of consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
contact us.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
International transfers
We may transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for? We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available upon request by contacting us.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 10 below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
(1) To request access to personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data held about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it
(2) To request correction of the personal data that we hold. This enables the correction of any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data provided to us.
(3) To request erasure of personal data. This enables the deletion or removal personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. A request can also be made for deletion or removal of personal data where the right to object to processing has been successfully exercised (see below), where we may have processed information unlawfully or where we are required to erase personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with requests of erasure for specific legal reasons with notification of this given, if applicable, at the time of any request.
(4) To object to processing of personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
(5) To request restriction of processing of personal data. This enables a request to be made to us to suspend the processing of personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it because it is needed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you objected to use of data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
(6) To request the transfer of personal data back to whom it belongs or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which we were given consent to use.
(7) To withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal of consent. If consent is withdrawn, we will not be able to provide our services. We will advise you of this at the time of the withdrawal of consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
