Privacy Policy
Like millions of other publishers of websites and apps, we use Google Analytics in our Topic Suggest app and other apps on iOS and Android to gather anonymous data about our users.
What does Google Analytics record?
Anonymous traffic data. For apps, this mainly comes down to which buttons a user clicks on or which app screens the user views the most.
What does Google Analytics not record?
Personal data. The recorded traffic data cannot be linked to you as a person.
What do we do with your data?
The tracking information mainly allows us to better understand which parts of our app are used the most and how they are used, so we can make better decisions about design and new features.
All of our tracking activities fall within the bounds of the
Google Analytics Terms of Service
