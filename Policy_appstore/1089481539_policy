6. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties
With other users:
You may disclose personal data with other people from the moment when you voluntarily disclose such information on the Luxy platform (including through your profile).
With service providers:
Luxy uses service providers to help us operate, distribute, market, and improve our Services. Service providers receive from Luxy only the personal data that they need for their specific activity. Luxy uses, among other things, service providers for sending emails, newsletters or text messages to their members. Service providers also provide the Luxy server capacity. Luxy uses service providers to process and store your data securely. External payment services and service providers in connection with debt collection support Luxy in processing payments. Depending on which payment method you select in the ordering process, payment providers collect your data independently to process payments (e.g., bank details or credit card details). Luxy also offers video calls in cooperation with our service providers.
With law enforcement / when required by law:
In addition, personal data can be transmitted to third parties if Luxy should be obliged to do so by law, legal process, or by enforceable administrative or judicial order, or to assist in the prevention or detection of a crime, or to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights:
We may also disclose personal data to third parties: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
With corporate transactions:
We may disclose your personal data if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control.
With your consent:
We may disclose your personal data if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, or other change of ownership or control.
7. Personal data retention
We store your personal data for as long as necessary to provide our Services and as permitted by applicable law.
If you decide to stop using our Services, you can delete your account. Following account deletion, we implement a safety and security window of thirty (30) days following the account deletion. During this period, your data will be retained but it won’t be visible anymore to others.
After that, we will begin with the deletion of your data, provided that there is no legal retention requirement for this data. We may block deletion of that data on the basis of our legitimate interest; for example, to safeguard the community, to prevent or detect criminal actions, when involved in official investigations, litigation, or in a claim or dispute with Luxy, or it is otherwise necessary to retain data to comply with our legal obligations or as necessary in connection with a legal proceeding. Following an account ban, Luxy may also retain data for safeguarding its community. We also keep records of consents users give us to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
Please note that if you choose to “deactivate your account”, your data won’t be deleted but your account is merely paused. During this time, your profile won’t be recommended to others, but your existing matches will still be able to view your profile.
The following applies to a Basic Membership: Luxy has the right to automatically delete personal profile data from basic members who are inactive for twenty-four (24) months.
The following applies to a Premium Membership: The personal data of Luxy premium members is stored for the duration of the contractual relationship. Once falling back to an active Basic Membership, your data is still being stored. However, Luxy may automatically delete personal profile data from basic members who are inactive for twenty-four (24) months.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Luxy may delete any data from you (whether you have a Basic Membership or Premium Membership) in the event you have been blocked, removed, or suspended from our Services.

9. Automated decision-making
Luxy uses automated decision-making to help connect you with other users and to ensure your safety and security.
Luxy uses the following data to generate profile recommendations: the information you tell us about yourself in your profile and your intended match; whether you are a photo verified user; whether your existing activity on the Luxy app with this profile including your membership status; and your device coordinates, which are necessary to understand your proximity to other members. Basis for processing profile and proximity information is that this is necessary for the provision of our contractual services to you.
Luxy uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent activities as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check various parameters that we indicated here in the Privacy Policy when using our Services (data we collect). If an activity meets a certain threshold, the relevant account may automatically be blocked.
Luxy uses automatic decision making for its price determination. The only criteria used here are the current users’ location and the purchase history of users on the Luxy app.

For more information on the scope and purposes of personal data collected by third parties, please review those third parties’ privacy policies and practices.
13. Cookies & Tracking
Our Services use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the user’s browser or your device’s memory. If the corresponding website is called up again, the user’s browser sends back the content of the cookies and thus enables the user to be recognized. Certain cookies are automatically deleted after the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored in the user’s browser for a specified time or permanently and then delete themselves (so-called temporary or permanent cookies).
What cookies does Luxy use?
Essential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary cookies to provide you with our Services, such as enabling you to log in, remembering your preferences, authenticating our users, and keeping you safe by detecting malicious activity.
Functional cookies: We use analysis cookies to record the usage behavior (e.g., visited sub-pages) of our users and to be able to evaluate them in statistical form.
Marketing cookies: Please see the below.
Marketing cookies and third-party tracking
We allow other companies to collect data from our users using marketing cookies. This enables us and third parties to display interest-based marketing to the users of our Services, which is based on an analysis of their usage behavior (e.g., clicked advertising banners, visited sub-pages) overall and not limited to our Services.
How can you control cookies?
You can control cookies by utilizing our cookie banner provided on the Services.
You can also control via your browser settings.
Please note, however, that our Services may not work or only function to a limited extent without cookies. We also recommend the website of
www.YourOnlineChoices.com
, where you can find information and assistance in connection with web tracking mechanisms.
Further, Luxy reserves the right to monitor in-app behavior in order to ensure security and safety, especially with particular focus on safeguarding user privacy and personal interests.
14. Online Analytics
We collect statistical information about the use of our Services in order to make them more user-friendly, to measure reach, to be able to carry out market research and to display marketing and advertisements relevant to you. For this purpose, we work with various authorized service providers and use online analytics tools, which are described below.
Appsflyer Analytics
The Services use Appsflyer Analytics, a mobile app and web analytics service. Appsflyer uses cookies that are stored on your computer, tablet, or smartphone and that enable an analysis of your use of the Services. Luxy uses Appsflyer to monitor advertising campaigns and on-platform event tracking. Luxy and its service providers do not share the information obtained in this process with third parties.
Google Analytics
The Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your computer, tablet or smartphone and that enable an analysis of your use of the Website. These are cookies from Google itself (Google Analytics cookies). Luxy uses Google Analytics with the additional function offered by Google for anonymizing IP addresses. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Website, to compile reports on Website activity and to provide other services related to Website and internet use, such as Google Analytics reports on performance based on demographic characteristics and interests. Google Analytics is being used on the Mobile Applications via the Firebase SDK, provided by Google for app analytics, statistical information and pure functionality reports (Google CrashLytics).
Use of Google Ads Conversion Tracking
Luxy uses the online advertising program “Google Ads” and, as part of Google Ad Words, Google Conversion Tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google. If you click on an advertisement placed by Google, a cookie for the conversion tracking is placed on your computer. These cookies lose their validity after ninety (90) days. If you visit certain websites from our Services and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that you clicked on the advertisement and were forwarded to our Services. Every Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for ads customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Here, Luxy finds out the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and have been forwarded to a page provided with a conversion tracking tag.
Use of Meta Custom Audiences
Luxy wants to present “interest-based advertising” on Meta and limit the frequency with which certain advertisements are displayed. Meta collects HTTP header information (including IP address, information about the web browser, page storage location, document, URL of the website or the respectively accessed page and user agent of the web browser as well as day and time of use); and events (the user’s website visit to Luxy, registration, purchasing). If the Meta ID contained in the Meta cookie can be assigned to a Meta user, Meta will assign this user to a “custom audience” based on the rules we have defined, provided the criteria applicable to this are met. We use the information received in this way to display ads on Meta. However, ads are only displayed from a “Custom Audience” size of 20 different users - so no conclusions can be drawn about the properties of the individual users from the placement of the ads. The assignment to a “Custom Audience” takes place for a maximum of 180 days. This period starts again when you visit our Website again and there is a conformity with the same “Custom Audience” rules. Meta can assign your visit to our Website and your related activities to your Meta user account. We cannot do this. We only receive statistical information from Meta about the use of our Website through Audience Insights.
Facebook Analytics
To utilize app login via Facebook, sharing and app analytics, the Luxy App uses Facebook Analytics SDK.
AWS Amplify
In order to utilize facial recognition for the picture verification, Luxy needs to use the SDK Amplify for the Mobile Application. This tool only guarantees the facilitation of the picture verification and no user data is being tracked and shared to its provider.
Social Plugins
The integration of social plugins regularly leads to the providers of the plugins storing cookies. In order to increase the protection of your data when visiting our Services, the plugins can be integrated into the page. Only when you activate the plugins will your internet browser or app establish a direct connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider. This gives the plugin provider the information that your internet browser has called up the corresponding page of our online offering, even if you do not have a user account with the provider or are not currently logged in. Log files (including the IP address) are transmitted from your Internet browser directly to a server of the respective plug-in provider and saved there if necessary. The plugins are independent extensions of the plugin providers. We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data collected and stored by the plugin providers via the plugins. If you do not want the plugin providers to receive the data collected via the Services, you should not use the respective plugins.

6. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties
With other users:
You may disclose personal data with other people from the moment when you voluntarily disclose such information on the Luxy platform (including through your profile).
With service providers:
Luxy uses service providers to help us operate, distribute, market, and improve our Services. Service providers receive from Luxy only the personal data that they need for their specific activity. Luxy uses, among other things, service providers for sending emails, newsletters or text messages to their members. Service providers also provide the Luxy server capacity. Luxy uses service providers to process and store your data securely. External payment services and service providers in connection with debt collection support Luxy in processing payments. Depending on which payment method you select in the ordering process, payment providers collect your data independently to process payments (e.g., bank details or credit card details). Luxy also offers video calls in cooperation with our service providers.
With law enforcement / when required by law:
In addition, personal data can be transmitted to third parties if Luxy should be obliged to do so by law, legal process, or by enforceable administrative or judicial order, or to assist in the prevention or detection of a crime, or to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights:
We may also disclose personal data to third parties: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.

7. Personal data retention
We store your personal data for as long as necessary to provide our Services and as permitted by applicable law.
If you decide to stop using our Services, you can delete your account. Following account deletion, we implement a safety and security window of thirty (30) days following the account deletion. During this period, your data will be retained but it won’t be visible anymore to others.
After that, we will begin with the deletion of your data, provided that there is no legal retention requirement for this data. We may block deletion of that data on the basis of our legitimate interest; for example, to safeguard the community, to prevent or detect criminal actions, when involved in official investigations, litigation, or in a claim or dispute with Luxy, or it is otherwise necessary to retain data to comply with our legal obligations or as necessary in connection with a legal proceeding. Following an account ban, Luxy may also retain data for safeguarding its community. We also keep records of consents users give us to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
Please note that if you choose to “deactivate your account”, your data won’t be deleted but your account is merely paused. During this time, your profile won’t be recommended to others, but your existing matches will still be able to view your profile.
The following applies to a Basic Membership: Luxy has the right to automatically delete personal profile data from basic members who are inactive for twenty-four (24) months.
The following applies to a Premium Membership: The personal data of Luxy premium members is stored for the duration of the contractual relationship. Once falling back to an active Basic Membership, your data is still being stored. However, Luxy may automatically delete personal profile data from basic members who are inactive for twenty-four (24) months.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Luxy may delete any data from you (whether you have a Basic Membership or Premium Membership) in the event you have been blocked, removed, or suspended from our Services.

9. Automated decision-making
Luxy uses automated decision-making to help connect you with other users and to ensure your safety and security.
Luxy uses the following data to generate profile recommendations: the information you tell us about yourself in your profile and your intended match; whether you are a photo verified user; whether your existing activity on the Luxy app with this profile including your membership status; and your device coordinates, which are necessary to understand your proximity to other members. Basis for processing profile and proximity information is that this is necessary for the provision of our contractual services to you.
Luxy uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent activities as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check various parameters that we indicated here in the Privacy Policy when using our Services (data we collect). If an activity meets a certain threshold, the relevant account may automatically be blocked.
Luxy uses automatic decision making for its price determination. The only criteria used here are the current users’ location and the purchase history of users on the Luxy app.

For more information on the scope and purposes of personal data collected by third parties, please review those third parties’ privacy policies and practices.
13. Cookies & Tracking
Our Services use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the user’s browser or your device’s memory. If the corresponding website is called up again, the user’s browser sends back the content of the cookies and thus enables the user to be recognized. Certain cookies are automatically deleted after the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored in the user’s browser for a specified time or permanently and then delete themselves (so-called temporary or permanent cookies).
What cookies does Luxy use?
Essential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary cookies to provide you with our Services, such as enabling you to log in, remembering your preferences, authenticating our users, and keeping you safe by detecting malicious activity.
Functional cookies: We use analysis cookies to record the usage behavior (e.g., visited sub-pages) of our users and to be able to evaluate them in statistical form.
Marketing cookies: Please see the below.
Marketing cookies and third-party tracking
We allow other companies to collect data from our users using marketing cookies. This enables us and third parties to display interest-based marketing to the users of our Services, which is based on an analysis of their usage behavior (e.g., clicked advertising banners, visited sub-pages) overall and not limited to our Services.
How can you control cookies?
You can control cookies by utilizing our cookie banner provided on the Services.
You can also control via your browser settings.
Please note, however, that our Services may not work or only function to a limited extent without cookies. We also recommend the website of
www.YourOnlineChoices.com
, where you can find information and assistance in connection with web tracking mechanisms.
Further, Luxy reserves the right to monitor in-app behavior in order to ensure security and safety, especially with particular focus on safeguarding user privacy and personal interests.
14. Online Analytics
We collect statistical information about the use of our Services in order to make them more user-friendly, to measure reach, to be able to carry out market research and to display marketing and advertisements relevant to you. For this purpose, we work with various authorized service providers and use online analytics tools, which are described below.
Appsflyer Analytics
The Services use Appsflyer Analytics, a mobile app and web analytics service. Appsflyer uses cookies that are stored on your computer, tablet, or smartphone and that enable an analysis of your use of the Services. Luxy uses Appsflyer to monitor advertising campaigns and on-platform event tracking. Luxy and its service providers do not share the information obtained in this process with third parties.
Google Analytics
The Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your computer, tablet or smartphone and that enable an analysis of your use of the Website. These are cookies from Google itself (Google Analytics cookies). Luxy uses Google Analytics with the additional function offered by Google for anonymizing IP addresses. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Website, to compile reports on Website activity and to provide other services related to Website and internet use, such as Google Analytics reports on performance based on demographic characteristics and interests. Google Analytics is being used on the Mobile Applications via the Firebase SDK, provided by Google for app analytics, statistical information and pure functionality reports (Google CrashLytics).
Use of Google Ads Conversion Tracking
Luxy uses the online advertising program “Google Ads” and, as part of Google Ad Words, Google Conversion Tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google. If you click on an advertisement placed by Google, a cookie for the conversion tracking is placed on your computer. These cookies lose their validity after ninety (90) days. If you visit certain websites from our Services and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that you clicked on the advertisement and were forwarded to our Services. Every Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for ads customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Here, Luxy finds out the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and have been forwarded to a page provided with a conversion tracking tag.
Use of Meta Custom Audiences
Luxy wants to present “interest-based advertising” on Meta and limit the frequency with which certain advertisements are displayed. Meta collects HTTP header information (including IP address, information about the web browser, page storage location, document, URL of the website or the respectively accessed page and user agent of the web browser as well as day and time of use); and events (the user’s website visit to Luxy, registration, purchasing). If the Meta ID contained in the Meta cookie can be assigned to a Meta user, Meta will assign this user to a “custom audience” based on the rules we have defined, provided the criteria applicable to this are met. We use the information received in this way to display ads on Meta. However, ads are only displayed from a “Custom Audience” size of 20 different users - so no conclusions can be drawn about the properties of the individual users from the placement of the ads. The assignment to a “Custom Audience” takes place for a maximum of 180 days. This period starts again when you visit our Website again and there is a conformity with the same “Custom Audience” rules. Meta can assign your visit to our Website and your related activities to your Meta user account. We cannot do this. We only receive statistical information from Meta about the use of our Website through Audience Insights.
Facebook Analytics
To utilize app login via Facebook, sharing and app analytics, the Luxy App uses Facebook Analytics SDK.
AWS Amplify
In order to utilize facial recognition for the picture verification, Luxy needs to use the SDK Amplify for the Mobile Application. This tool only guarantees the facilitation of the picture verification and no user data is being tracked and shared to its provider.
Social Plugins
The integration of social plugins regularly leads to the providers of the plugins storing cookies. In order to increase the protection of your data when visiting our Services, the plugins can be integrated into the page. Only when you activate the plugins will your internet browser or app establish a direct connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider. This gives the plugin provider the information that your internet browser has called up the corresponding page of our online offering, even if you do not have a user account with the provider or are not currently logged in. Log files (including the IP address) are transmitted from your Internet browser directly to a server of the respective plug-in provider and saved there if necessary. The plugins are independent extensions of the plugin providers. We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data collected and stored by the plugin providers via the plugins. If you do not want the plugin providers to receive the data collected via the Services, you should not use the respective plugins.
