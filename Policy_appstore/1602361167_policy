Launch: Makeover
30 December 2021
Scratching my own itch, you probably don’t need this.
The Backstory
Someone asked me if I could make Vinegar toolbar’s appearance customizable. I said that’s probably out of the scope of the extension. Then I looked at the existing Safari extensions on iOS and couldn’t find any lightweight extensions that let you re-style web pages. So yeah, new extension time.
Makeover lets you change the appearance and behavior of web pages with CSS and JavaScript. To use it, you go to a web page you want to customize, tap the Makeover icon, and paste the CSS/JS code into the text field.
How do you find the CSS selectors on iOS? Well, I have
another extension
that does just that…
