2. Information Collection
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we
            collect information when you use our Services, book travel, register
            for our Services or set up a Southwest account, SWABIZ® account, or
            Rapid Rewards® account, subscribe to our e-mails, mobile messages,
            or social media notifications, post on our forums or blogs,
            participate in the Rapid Rewards® Program, a sweepstakes, contest,
            promotion, survey, or poll, communicate with us via third party
            social media sites, shop our Services, order physical or digital
            gift cards, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise
            communicate with us through the Services. We and our agents, vendors, and 
            service providers may record, monitor, process, and retain communications 
            and associated information, including emails, chats, calls, and texts. 
            We may use chatbot technology and other automated methods of communication.
The types of information we may collect include Personal
            Information. "Personal Information" is information that could
            reasonably be linked with a particular individual or household, such
            as your first and last name, e-mail address, zip code, billing
            address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information,
            social media account information, travel preferences, birth date,
            redress number, and demographic information. “Personal Information”
            also may include sensitive information, such as present and future
            health status, and genetic or biometric information, to allow us to better serve
            your needs (for example, to assist you with boarding a flight if you
            need a wheelchair or with meeting safety requirements).
You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us
            through the Services, including Personal Information, but you are
            solely responsible for the information that you submit to us.
If you apply for or inquire about employment with us, “Personal
            Information” may also include your education, occupation, 
              employment history, and any other information submitted as part of your application or inquiry. 
              This Privacy Policy is not intended to be a
            substitute for disclosure or authorization obligations regarding
            background checks, which may be required under the Fair Credit
            Reporting Act or similar laws. If we conduct a background check on
            you, at that time we will provide you with separate disclosure and
            authorization forms informing you of our intent to check your
            background, and requesting your consent to do so.

            demographic information; IP address; browser/device/hardware type;

            Services; and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g.,

            data status, capability, confirmation, functionality, performance

            you take as you browse through the Services. We and our agents, vendors, 
              and service providers may use session replay and other technologies to 
              collect page interaction information and other electronic communications 
              and content from your use of the Services (such as content entry, 
            mouse movements, screen captures, the date, time, and location of your visit, 
           what areas of the Services you visit and for how long, what search terms or other

              address and the referring link through which you accessed our
              Services.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
              We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may use cookies,
              web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts,
              location-identifying technologies, in-app tracking methods, and
              other tracking technologies to collect information about you when
              you interact with our Services or e-mails, including information
              about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We and our agents,
              vendors, and service providers may combine this information with
              other information about you and use it for various purposes, such
              as analyzing and improving our Services and your online experience,
              understanding which areas and features of our Services are
              popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness,
              tailoring communications with you, determining whether an e-mail
              has been opened and/or links within the e-mail have been clicked,
              and for other internal business purposes. Please note that, in accordance 
              with local legal requirements, in some territories you will be presented 
              with a notice which will contain more information about the technologies we 
              use and provide you with a means to select and manage your preferences in addition to the options set out below.
Cookies: Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer
                when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used
                for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user
                preferences or web pages visited while using our Services. Some
                web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
                prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject
                certain cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or
                reject cookies, this could affect the availability and
                functionality of our Services. For example, cookies allow us and
                our agents, vendors, and service providers to store items in
                your cart between visits. In addition, please be aware that if
                you choose to block cookies, some preferences that are dependent
                on cookies may not be able to be respected.
Web Beacons: We and our agents, vendors, and service providers
                may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known
                as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and e-mail
                messages. We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may
                use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of
                purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of
                visitors to our Service, to monitor how users navigate the
                Services, and to count how many e-mails that we sent were
                actually opened or how many particular articles or links were
                actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is
                designed to collect information about your interactions with the
                Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from
                our web server or a third party with whom we work, is designed
                to be active only while you are connected to the Service, and
                deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies: We and our agents, vendors,
                and service providers may use GPS (global positioning systems)
                software and other location-based technologies to locate you so
                we may verify your location, and deliver relevant content to you
                based on your location. We may collect precise location
                information from your device.
In-App Tracking Methods: There are a variety of tracking
                technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and
                these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be
                controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or
                other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user
                activity to a particular app.
Information we and our agents, vendors, and service providers
            automatically collect about you, such as how you interact with our
            Services, may be combined with your Personal Information. If we
            associate any such automatically-collected information with Personal
            Information about you, our objective will be to treat the combined
            information as Personal Information.
We and our business partners and other third parties may send you
            product promotions that are aligned with your purchase trends and/or
            interests identified through automatically-collected information.

            visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of
            the Service and certain third party sites participating in the same
            networks and exchanges. These entities may use cookies, web beacons,
            pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to collect
            information about your use of the Service, such as your IP address,
            web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and
            conversion information. This information may be used by us and
            others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the
            popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content
            targeted to your interests on the Services and other websites and
            better understand your online activity. Data collected from a
            particular browser or device may be used with another computer or
            device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data
            was collected, or transferred to a non-affiliate for such purposes.
This means that some information about your browsing of the Service
            and certain third party sites may be shared with these companies for
            the purpose of delivering ads to you on the Services and certain
            third party sites, and Southwest may receive from some of these
            companies information about third party sites that you have visited.
            This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is
            sometimes termed "retargeting" to indicate that information from one
            retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by
            another retailer.
These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information
            about your online activities over time and across different websites
            when you use our Service.
We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a
            customized campaign on other websites or platforms.
This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such
            third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of
            browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit,
            page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect
            that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).
Please note that, in accordance with local legal requirements, in some 
            territories you will be presented with a notice which will contain more 
            information about the technologies we use and provide you with a means to 
            select and manage your preferences in addition to the options below; in those 
            territories, you may also click the icon on the bottom of the Southwest 
            website or app to access the preference center. Note that your browser settings may also allow you to automatically
            transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you
            visit. Like many websites and online services, Southwest currently
            does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track”
            signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not
            Track,” you may wish to visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the US 
            Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may
            display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads. You can
            learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at
http://www.youradchoices.com
. The DAA also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of
            cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To
            exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download
            the AppChoice app at
http://youradchoices.com/appchoices.
In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may
            participate in the US Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI has
            developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted
            advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more
            about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, visit
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with,
            any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of
            their statements regarding their programs. Choices you make are both
            browser and device-specific and your preferences are deleted
            whenever you clear your cookies or browser’s cache.
Southwest also has a specific marketing platform that uses
            persistent cookies.
Click this link to opt out from our marketing platform’s
              persistent cookies
(please note that if you delete your cookies or switch to a
            different browser you will have to repeat this procedure). Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of
            certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive
            generic ads.

8. Social Features
Certain functionality on the Services is specifically designed to
            permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and third
            party websites or services, including third party social networks
            (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include enabling
            you to transmit content to the Service from your account on a third
            party website or service; to “like” or “share” our Services content
            to other websites or services; to log-in to the Services using your
            username and password for a third party site or service; and to
            otherwise connect our Services to a third party website or service.
If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or
            provide access to, including User Content, may be publicly displayed
            on our Services or by the provider of the Social Feature that you
            use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform
            that references our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated
            with Southwest in a tweet or status update), your post may be
            published on our Service in accordance with the terms of the third
            party website or service. Also, both Southwest and the third party
            may have access to certain information about you and your use of our
            Services and the third party site or service. In addition, we may
            receive information about you if other users of a third party
            website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their
            “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible
            through your “connections” web pages, profile pages, or similar
            pages on a social networking or other third party website or
            interactive service.
The information we collect in connection with Social Features is
            subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored
            by the third parties remains subject to those third parties’ privacy
            practices, including whether the third parties continue to share
            information with us, the types of information shared, and your
            choices with regard to what is visible to others on those third
            party websites or services.

9. Refer-a-Friend
You may use a referral feature, if we make it available to you in your territory, to inform a friend about our
            services. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using
            this referral feature to send a single e-mail to such designated
            recipients about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and
            events and provide news and information we think will be of interest
            to such designated recipients. By using a referral feature, you
            represent that you have permission to provide your friend’s email address.
            Southwest will not be responsible for the accuracy of the
            information you provide.

10. Third Party Websites
The Services contain hyperlinks to other websites or locations that
            we do not control and are operated and controlled by third parties
            ("Third Party Websites"). We make no representations regarding the
            policies or business practices of such Third Party Websites and
            encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies
            before providing them with your Personal Information. Our Privacy
            Policy does not apply to these Third Party Websites. You should read
            the privacy policy of each Third Party Website as these Third Party
            Websites may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology
            to independently collect information about you. In addition, these
            Third Party Websites may solicit Personal Information from you.

11. TSA Guidelines
The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of 
            Homeland Security requires us to collect information from you for purposes 
            of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, 
            and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. 
            Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, 
            you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or 
            authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you 
            provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under 
            its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies,

            Android/Google Device, we may offer Face ID/Touch ID or Face Unlock/Fingerprint 
            Unlock for such devices as an alternative log-in method to password. We are 
            only notified as to whether the authentication was successful and cannot 
            access the Face ID or Touch ID nor the Face Unlock or Fingerprint Unlock or 
            the data associated with the use of such capabilities. For more details,

13. Your Choices
Profile and Apps
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information
            you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part
            of registration. The Services may allow you to access, review,
            correct, update, and remove or make inaccessible Personal
            Information you have provided through the Services’ registration or
            otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes by

            e-mail, or postal mail as detailed
here
.
With respect to our mobile and other applications, you can
            prospectively stop all collection of information by the application
            by uninstalling the application. Also, you may at any time restrict
            our access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in
            your mobile device.
It is our objective to make good faith efforts to make requested
            changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably
            practicable (but we may retain prior information as business
            records). Please note that it is not always possible to completely
            remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that
            residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
Promotional Communications
You can opt out of receiving promotional e-mail communications from
            us at any time by following the instructions provided in those
            communications or e-mail us as detailed

. If you receive promotional text messages from us, you may opt 
            out of the applicable text messaging program by replying “STOP” to 
            a promotional text message you receive.
As a Southwest customer, Southwest account holder, SWABIZ®, or Rapid
            Rewards® Member, or user of the Services, you may also receive
            periodic promotional postal mailings from Southwest Airlines and/or
            our select marketing partners. If you do not wish to receive such
            promotional mailings, you may opt out at any time by following the
            instructions provided in those mailings or e-mail us as detailed
here
.
Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional emails, 
            text messages or other communications, we and our agents, vendors, 
            and service providers may continue to send you non-promotional e-mails, 
            non-promotional text messages and other types of communications, as 
            permitted by law, such as those about our ongoing business relations. 
            For example, we and our agents, vendors, and service providers may 
            send e-mails and other communications that contain service-related 
            announcements that affect your account, confirmations and updates 
            regarding reservations you have made, requests for feedback on our 
            services and/or your specific travel experiences, information about 
            your job application or responses to your comments and feedback 
            submitted to us and our agents, vendors, and service providers.
Southwest mobile applications may send you notifications that may
            include alerts, sounds, and icon badges. These push notifications or
            in-app messages may include both operational messages and
            promotional messages regarding products, services and offers that
            may be of interest to you. Push notifications and other alerts can be configured in
            settings on your mobile device. As with e-mails, even if you opt out
            of receiving promotional communications, we may continue to send you
            non-promotional push notifications and other alerts, such as those about your use of
            the applications or our ongoing business relations.

              subject to certain exceptions; request that we not share your Personal Information with third parties for
            certain behavioral or targeted advertising purposes; and request that we not
            sell your Personal Information to third parties for valuable

            out at
https://optout.aboutads.info/
, and otherwise set your preferences as described in
Section 7
. Keep in mind that your cookie and tracking tools choices are
            typically website, device, and browser specific, and may be deleted
            if you clear your browser's cache.
Our policy does not permit discrimination against you for making
            such a request. To make a Personal Information request,
click here
or call us at 1-800-435-9792. The web forms and
            phone number are not intended to be used for general submission of
            complaints or comments. For such inquiries, please visit the Help Center page on
            Southwest.com for Customer Service options.
Please note that we may deny your request, or fulfill a request only
            in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. For example, we
            may retain Personal Information as permitted by law, such as for tax
            or other record keeping purposes, to maintain an active account, and
            to process transactions and facilitate customer requests. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your Personal Information request and would like to request further review, you may submit an appeal request from within the portal account that was provided to you as part of the Personal Information request process or send an email to
Southwest.Privacy@wnco.com
with “Personal Information Requests Appeal” in the subject line. We
            intend to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to
            responding to your requests. The verification steps will vary
            depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and whether
            you have an account with us. If you designate an authorized agent to
            make a request on your behalf, please ensure the authorized agent is
            identified as an authorized agent.
The Personal Information requests under this Section do 
            not apply to information about job applicants, employees and
            other employment affiliates. Southwest employees, directors,
            officers, contractors, interns, job applicants and designated
            beneficiaries that are California residents can submit certain
            requests regarding their Personal Information processed in the
            employment context by clicking

15. Children
Our Services are not intended for and are not targeted to children
            under the age of sixteen (16). If you are a child under the age of
            sixteen (16), you are not permitted to use the Services and should
            not send any information about yourself to us through the Services.
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children
            under the age of sixteen (16) and, if we learn that we have received
            information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete this
            information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy
            Protection Act (“COPPA”). If you are a parent or guardian and you
            believe that your child under the age of 13, has provided
            us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please
            contact us by e-mail as detailed
here
.
If you have registered to use the Services, and have posted content
            or information on the Services, you can request that such
            information be removed from the Services by contacting us by e-mail
            as detailed
here
or by sending a letter to Southwest Airlines Co., P.O. Box 36647
            TOP-1CR, Dallas, Texas 75235 (Attention: Legal Counsel), stating
            that you personally posted such content or information and detailing
            where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable
            good faith efforts to endeavor to remove the post from prospective
            public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually
            identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or
            comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have
            republished the post and archived copies of it may be stored by
            search engines and others that we do not control.

16. Data Security
It is our goal to take reasonable measures to help protect
            information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized
            access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Although Southwest’s
            objective is to use reasonable efforts to help protect your
            information, transmission via the Internet is not completely secure
            and Southwest cannot guarantee the security of your information
            collected through our Services. Further, you are responsible for
            protecting your password.

            notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy,
            and in some cases, we may choose to provide you with additional
            notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our Services
            or sending you an e-mail notification). If the changes are material,
            we may provide you additional notice.

20. Individuals from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
This Section of the Privacy Policy only applies to those who use our Services and are in a country that is a Member State of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland. To the extent that Southwest is subject to the laws of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom when processing Personal Information, Southwest shall be a “data controller” under such laws.
The law in Europe requires us to have legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Information. Where applicable, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
Performance of a contract with you: Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Legitimate interests: We may use your Personal Information where it is necessary to conduct our business and pursue our legitimate interests, for example to prevent fraud and enable us to give you the best and most secure customer experience. We consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights (both positive and negative) before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests.
To protect vital interest of you or another person: We may use your Personal Information to prevent harm, ensure safety, or respond to emergencies where necessary.
Legal obligation: We may use your Personal Information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
Consent: We rely on consent only where we have obtained your active agreement to use your Personal Information for a specified purpose, for example if you subscribe to an email newsletter or given your explicit consent by providing us with sensitive health information to manage special assistance requests.
Whenever we transfer your Personal Information out of your country to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as your home country, a similar degree of protection is afforded to it using the following safeguards if applicable:
Standard contractual terms approved for use such as those approved by the Swiss, European Union and UK and other applicable regulators for enabling transfers.
Adequacy decision made by a home state meaning the country to whom the information is transferred to has been determined to afford an equivalent level of protection to the EU/UK or other territory as applicable.
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
In Europe, you have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which we will notify you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Information which override your right to object.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information.
Complain to the relevant data protection authority.
Not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you.
To exercise your rights under this Section, email us at
Southwest.Privacy@wnco.com

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information or to exercise any of the other rights in this Section. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to an unauthorized person. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests under this Section within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Note that if you would like to opt-out of cookie-based tracking for behaviorally targeted advertising purposes, you will need to separately adjust your browser settings and otherwise set your preferences as described in Section 7.
Please note that we may deny your request, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. For example, we may retain Personal Information as permitted by law, such as for tax or other record keeping purposes, to maintain an active account, and to process transactions and facilitate customer requests. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your Personal Information request and would like to request further review, you may submit an appeal request from within the portal account that was provided to you as part of the Personal Information request process or send an email to

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you use our Service, book travel, register for our Service or set up a Southwest account, SWABIZ® account, or Rapid Rewards® account, subscribe to our e-mails, mobile messages, or social media notifications, post on our forums or blogs, participate in the Rapid Rewards® Program, a sweepstakes, contest, promotion, survey, or poll, communicate with us via third party social media sites, shop our Service, order physical or digital gift cards, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us through the Service.

If you apply for or inquire about employment with us, “Personal Information” may also include your education, occupation, and employment history. “Personal Information” also may include sensitive information, such as present and future health status, and genetic information, to allow us to better serve your needs (for example, to assist you with boarding a flight if you need a wheelchair).

Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
              We may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our Service and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our Service are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an e-mail has been opened and/or links within the e-mail have been clicked, and for other internal business purposes.
Cookies: Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences or web pages visited while using our Service. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Service. For example, cookies allow us to store items in your cart between visits. In addition, please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
Web Beacons: We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and e-mail messages. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to our Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies: We and our third party service providers may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location, and deliver relevant content to you based on your location. We may collect precise location information from your device.
In-App Tracking Methods: There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app.
Information we automatically collect about you, such as how you interact with our Service, may be combined with your Personal Information. If we associate any such automatically-collected information with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

4. Sharing of Information
Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers have access to Personal Information to carry out work on our behalf.
We may also share information about you for various purposes.
            Primary purposes for sharing of information include:
With the Transportation and Security Administration (“TSA”) as
              legally permitted or required under the authority of 49 U.S.C.
              section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act
              of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560;
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in response to
              (i) subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith
              opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law; and/or
              (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an
              investigation;
To defend the Terms & Conditions or other policies applicable to
              our Services;
If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user
              agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life,
              health, security and safety of us or any third party;
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we may also use
              IP addresses, mobile device identifiers or any other information
              we collect to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with
              copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service
              providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such
              disclosures may be carried out without notice to you;
With our agents, vendors, and service providers for purposes of
              managing and fulfilling your travel reservations, product
              purchases, transportation services, activities, events,
              excursions, and Rapid Rewards® Program points. For example, we may
              share your information with our Rewards® Partners to help
              facilitate your purchase, transfer, or gift of Rapid Rewards®
              points.

              your address in order to ensure we maintain the accuracy of our
              database;
With our affiliates for internal business purposes (including but
              not limited to managing your travel and/or accounts); and
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or
              actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation,
              realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, amalgamation or
              any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Southwest
              assets, financing, disposal, conveyance or transfer of all or a
              portion of our business to another company.
In addition, there may be secondary purposes for sharing of
            information, such as:
With our business partners, affiliates and other third parties for
              purposes of sending their own marketing. For example, we may share
              your information with our financial institution Rewards® Partners
              for their direct marketing purposes, which may include, but is not
              limited to, marketing their co-branded credit cards to you;

              as the process described above) in order for us to offer you more
              relevant products and services;
For a purpose disclosed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, or at
              the time you provide your Personal Information. For example, if
              you link your account to a corporate travel account, we may share
              Personal Information with your company’s travel administrators and
              other personnel; and
With your consent or at your direction or as required or permitted
              by applicable law.
Whether sharing is primary or secondary may change over time. Some
            of the information we share under primary purposes may be shared for
            secondary purposes.
In our sole discretion, we may also share aggregated or
            de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify
            you with third parties or affiliates.

Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that Southwest does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.

6. Rapid Rewards®, Sweepstakes, Contests, and Surveys
We may offer you the opportunity to participate in our Rapid Rewards® Program, sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) that may require registration or for you to submit Personal Information through the Service. Participation in these Promotions is completely voluntary.

7. Advertising & Analytics Services and Online Tracking
We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics about the use of our Service. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Service visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your use of the Service, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and other websites and better understand your online activity. Data collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a non-affiliate for such purposes.
This means that some information about your browsing of the Service and certain third party sites may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on the Service and certain third party sites, and Southwest may receive from some of these companies information about third party sites that you have visited. This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed "retargeting" to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer.
These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information
            about your online activities over time and across different websites
            when you use our Service.
We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a
            customized campaign on other websites or platforms.
This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such
            third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of
            browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit,
            page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect
            that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically
            transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you
            visit. Like many websites and online services, Southwest currently
            does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track”
            signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not
            Track,” you may wish to visit
http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the
            Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may
            display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads. You can
            learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at
http://www.youradchoices.com
. The DAA also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of
            cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To
            exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download
            the AppChoice app at
http://youradchoices.com/appchoices.
In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may
            participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI has
            developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted
            advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more
            about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, visit
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with,
            any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of
            their statements regarding their programs. Choices you make are both
            browser and device-specific and your preferences are deleted
            whenever you clear your cookies or browser’s cache.
Southwest also has a specific marketing platform that uses
            persistent cookies.
Click this link to opt out from our marketing platform’s
              persistent cookies
(please note that if you delete your cookies or switch to a
            different browser you will have to repeat this procedure). Use of
            cookies by Southwest’s marketing platform is subject to its privacy
            policies. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of
            certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive
            generic ads.

8. Social Features
Certain functionality on the Service is specifically designed to permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and third party websites or services, including third party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to transmit content to the Service from your account on a third party website or service; to “like” or “share” our Service content to other websites or services; to log-in to the Service using your username and password for a third party site or service; and to otherwise connect our Service to a third party website or service.
If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to, including User Content, may be publicly displayed on our Service or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Southwest in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on our Service in accordance with the terms of the third party website or service. Also, both Southwest and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Service and the third party site or service. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web pages, profile pages, or similar pages on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.
The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third parties remains subject to those third parties’ privacy practices, including whether the third parties continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on those third party websites or services.

9. Refer-a-Friend
You may use a referral feature to inform a friend about our services. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature to send a single e-mail to such designated recipients about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide news and information we think will be of interest to such designated recipients. By using a referral feature, you represent that you and your friend are United States citizens and that you have permission to provide your friend’s email address. Southwest will not be responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.

10. Third Party Websites
The Service contains hyperlinks to other websites or locations that we do not control and are operated and controlled by third parties ("Third Party Websites"). We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of such Third Party Websites and encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your Personal Information. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third Party Websites. You should read the privacy policy of each Third Party Website as these Third Party Websites may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to independently collect information about you. In addition, these Third Party Websites may solicit Personal Information from you.

11. TSA Guidelines
