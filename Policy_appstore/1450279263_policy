## 1. Scope of This Policy
This Terms of Service and Privacy Policy applies to all apps listed above and any other apps published by us under our Apple App Store and Google Play Store accounts. While features and functionalities may vary across apps,
                this policy addresses common practices related to data collection, storage, usage, and user rights. Additionally, this policy includes provisions for potential future integrations and updates.

## 2. General
It is your responsibility to keep any app and account information private. We are not liable for unauthorised access to your account, whether created within the apps or through your app store provider. Apps may store and
                process personal data you provide, either locally or externally. It is also your responsibility to keep your device secure and ensure access to the apps remains protected.
Certain app functionalities require an active internet connection. We cannot be held responsible for reduced functionality or interruptions in service if an active internet connection is unavailable.
We are solely responsible for the development, maintenance, and support of the apps. If you encounter issues, please contact us with details, and we will make reasonable efforts to address them. However, we are not liable if
                issues cannot or will not be resolved.
Some data within the apps may be supplied by third-party providers and could be subject to sudden changes or discontinuation. This may limit the intended use of the apps. As such changes are outside our control, we are not
                liable for their occurrence.
We cannot guarantee the continued maintenance or availability of the apps. We may discontinue or stop maintaining apps at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or liability to users. In such cases, we will
                endeavour to notify you in advance. We accept no liability for any direct or indirect loss you may experience as a result of issues with the apps. You are solely responsible for how you use the apps.

## 3. Data Collection and Usage
Our applications may collect information, and third-party services such as Apple, Firebase, or Google may collect additional data, including personal identifiers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these
                third parties, and we encourage you to review their respective privacy policies. By using our apps, you consent to the collection and processing of this information as outlined in this policy.
We respect your privacy and handle the information you share with our apps responsibly. While the apps may not collect personally identifiable information directly, some jurisdictions may classify certain data under data
                protection laws, requiring your explicit consent. We may request access to certain permissions that involve personal information, including but not limited to: Device logs; Analytics data; Crash data; App performance data;
                Camera access; Photo Library access; Location data; Advertising data; Personal data such as IDs or user-inputted information; Error logs.
**Purpose of Data Collection**
The apps may collect analytical information to enhance user experience and app functionality. This data provides insights into app usage, helping us identify and fix issues. Error logs may also be collected to address bugs
                or crashes. Logs may include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, time and date of usage, and other relevant statistics.
**User Responsibility**
Users are responsible for any data they choose to share via links or other features within the apps.
**Third-Party Advertising**

Some apps use location services that may use data to send to APIs for functionality.
**Location Services**
Certain apps use location services to provide functionality such as API integrations or map displays. This data may be processed locally or shared externally to enable app features.
**Consent Management**
Before collecting data, users are presented with a consent prompt detailing the type of data collected, its purpose, and any third-party sharing involved. By continuing to use the apps, you agree to this data collection. You
                can withdraw consent at any time by disabling permissions in your device settings. In compliance with GDPR, we seek explicit consent for data collection, processing, and sharing. Users can withdraw their consent at any time
                by disabling permissions in their device settings or managing their data in-app.
**Third-Party Policy Updates**
Third-party service providers (e.g., Firebase, AdMob) may update their privacy policies or terms of service at their discretion. We recommend periodically reviewing these policies to stay informed about their data collection
