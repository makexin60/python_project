We monitor the condition of our networks, including Fios Internet Wi-Fi, such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, quality and environmental conditions including nearby Wi-Fi access points. We may also collect test information from or take pictures or a video of equipment we install or repair.
We install system software on some wireless devices which may:
collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and apps on the device.
automatically install apps or software when you activate your device, during certain operating system upgrades and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement. The software may also update apps that it installed on your device or when you otherwise permit it.  It also collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may send you notifications about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.
Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?
Learn about our information security and retention practices and how to update your account information.
Information security and retention.
We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we disclose this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need.
Our policies require that we retain records for as long as they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name is part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.
Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized
attempt to access
32
, use or disclose personal information. We use our security and incident response plans to handle such incidents. You can help secure your account using
advice, tips and tools we provide
.

attempt to access
For example, we have seen unauthorized attempts to access our customers' third party accounts, including accounts that customers have with financial institutions, email service providers or social media.
If you become aware of a security issue, please visit our page to
Report Security Vulnerabilities
and follow the instructions to report your issue. We will work with you to address your concern.
Let’s work together to keep children safe.
If you see content you believe to be related to child sexual abuse, or if you see any other illegal content involving children when using a Verizon service, report it by sending an email to abuse-csam@verizon.com and include the words “child sexual abuse material” in the subject line. You can also make a report directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through their
CyberTipline.

Do I have additional rights under Federal law?
You may have additional rights under the Cable Act.
Information about the Cable Act
The “Cable Act” (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended) limits the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators and requires operators to tell you, to the extent that the Cable Act applies to the services you purchase, about the
personally identifiable information
33
they collect.

Personally Identifiable Information
Under the Cable Act, personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person
We may use our cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render cable service or other services provided to you over the cable system and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. We may collect additional personally identifiable information with your prior consent. We may use or disclose personally identifiable information without consent where necessary to render services and to conduct legitimate business activities related to the services we provide.
We may also disclose your name and address as long as you have the ability to prevent or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, your viewing or other uses of the services we provide. We disclose name and address information to service providers as part of our Relevant TV advertising program. These providers work on our behalf to help our advertisers optimize their ads by preventing the same ads you see on Fios from being shown to you in other places. You can opt out of participating in the
Relevant TV advertising program

We may also disclose personally identifiable information if it is required by law to comply with
valid legal process

Valid Legal Process
We may disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, but we will not disclose records revealing your video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.
We retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes. If you would like to access the personally identifiable information we have about you, please submit a
privacy inquiry form
to arrange a time and convenient location to do so during business hours. If you believe any of your personally identifiable information is inaccurate, we will work with you to update our records.
If you believe that your Cable Act privacy rights have been violated, please submit a
privacy inquiry form
and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

Illinois Biometric Information Privacy
The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act applies to
Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information

.
Close

58.
Biometric Identifiers or Biometric Information
Biometric Identifiers means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of your hand or face geometry. Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.
What we collect and how we use it.
We may collect and use certain Biometric Information to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.
When we
disclose Biometric Information.
We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.
How long we retain Biometric Information.
We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):
We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan.
We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.
We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.

customer personal information
Maine law defines “customer personal information” as personally identifying information about a customer or information from a customer’s use of broadband Internet access service.
We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your Maine broadband customer personal information except for
purposes allowed under the Maine law
61
or with your affirmative consent. We may ask you for this consent when we interact with you. For example, we may ask to use broadband customer personal information to market
additional services
62
to you when you call us or come into our stores.

Purposes allowed under the Maine law
Maine law allows us to use and disclose broadband customer personal information to provide and maintain your broadband services; market and advertise our communications-related services to you; comply with lawful court orders; bill and collect; protect users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of or subscription to such services; or provide location information in response to certain emergency situations
.

additional services
By “additional services,” we mean Verizon or partner services that are not communications-related.
The Maine law also provides you with a right to opt-out of any use or disclosure of data that is not customer personal information under the law.
