Perlego Privacy Policy
Please read this privacy notice carefully as it contains important information on (i) who we are; (ii) how and why we collect, store, use and share personal information; (iii) your rights in relation to your personal information; (iv) how a third party may access your personal information; and (v) how to contact us and/or the ICO if you have a complaint.
We use personal data to provide our ebook services and related content to people who request it, register for it, or access our workspaces or community eReaders through an invitation, and to manage our relationships with those people. Generally, we do not share your information with third parties, but there are some exceptions where we use external service providers to power our operations – some of these are outside the UK/EEA. We are happy to answer your questions about any of this – email us at
help@perlego.com
.
We are registered at the UK Information Commissioner’s Office under number
ZA210414
.
Who we are
Perlego Limited ("Perlego”) collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you, which is referred to as “personal data.” When we do so, we are regulated under data protection laws in the UK and EU. We are responsible as "controller" of that personal information for the purposes of those laws.
The personal information we collect and use
Information collected by us, and how we use it
As part of providing the Perlego service, we collect the following personal information (either when it’s provided to us by you, or when we derive it from your use of the service via cookies or similar technology (for more information please see our cookies notice here
Cookie Settings page
):
Contact details. We use this to communicate with you; to authenticate you when you log in to the service; to help facilitate payments; to manage your referral plan account; and to help resolve account and technical issues experienced while using Perlego. If you sign up to Perlego and don’t complete a subscription, we will use your contact details to encourage you to take out a subscription if you have consented to us contacting you in this way during the sign-up process.
Summaries of conversations. We use this to help resolve account and technical issues experienced using Perlego. Such conversations may be conducted with Perlego employees and/or our support helpdesk and may involve the use of our AI chatbot feature.
Details of your subscription to Perlego. We use this to provide you with the Perlego service, to inform you on our methods of communication, and to calculate payments to our publisher partners.
Your geographical region and IP address. We use this to determine whether we have to charge you sales tax; to help resolve technical and account issues; to determine whether we can give you access to the service or to certain books; and to record, and report to our publisher partners, the usage levels of books.
Transactions you undertake on Perlego. This is to enable us to record, and report to our publisher partners, the usage levels of books; and to display to you transactions you undertake on Perlego.
Your usage of the service. This includes the books you read, your reading interests, annotations, highlights and bookmarks; your preferences for viewing books (e.g., font); the mouse activity and keystrokes in your use of the service; and your search history. We use this to provide you with the service, to recommend books and topics to you, to calculate payments due to our publisher partners, and for security and content protection purposes.
In some cases, your course and university or your employer (depending on whether you have a standard account or organization-based account). We use this as part of our reporting information to our publisher partners, and to authenticate you to the service.
Your name and the information accessed and/or uploaded/embedded by you in a workspace or community eReader you either create or are invited to. We use this to provide you with the service; to monitor user content in accordance with our content guidelines and for security purposes.
Payment Information. We use this to determine whether you have paid to access the service or a book, and to check if you are entitled to a free subscription when you apply for one. We use Stripe as our payment processor.
Marketing preferences. We use this to determine whether and how we communicate with you to promote Perlego.
We gather certain technical information from your use of our website by means of cookies and similar technologies. For more details, please review our
Cookie Settings page
.
Additionally, we use the information for the purposes of research we undertake to understand how people use our service, and the books on it, in order to identify the improvements we can make to the service, how we promote it, and the range of books we offer. The research we produce is on an aggregated basis and does not identify you personally. We use it internally and may also provide it to others. We also use some of the information for the purposes of keeping Perlego and our communications with you secure from unauthorized access and attacks, and for reporting any unlawful activity. We may need to process your information for the purposes of enforcing our terms of use.
If you have previously consented to our processing of your data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. To do so, simply email us at
help@perlego.com
.
If you withdraw your consent and we do not have another legal basis for processing your data, we will stop processing it. However, if we have another legal basis for continuing to process your data, we may do so, in accordance with your legal rights.

Some of those companies are based outside the European Economic Area — for further information including on how we safeguard your personal data when this occurs, see paragraph 7 below. We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law.
Third-party access to your information
Where you create and/or are invited to a Perlego workspace or an eReader whereby you can engage with other users/invitees ("community eReader”), your information may be shared with and/or accessed by third parties who have joined the Perlego workspaces/community eReader. You acknowledge that such parties may have access to your personal information as available on such workspaces/community eReader. Should you not wish for your information to be shared with these third parties, please refrain from either joining or creating a workspace or community eReader.
By accessing or creating a workspace or community eReader, you consent to the sharing of your information with other third parties accessing that workspace and/or community eReader. Perlego takes no responsibility for who is invited to a workspace or community eReader or how any party invited utilizes your information.
How long your personal information will be kept for
We will hold your information for different periods of time, as follows:
Payment data is held for seven years from the date of transaction;
Server logs are held for 90 days;
Records of how you’ve used the service are held for seven years (this is in case one of our publisher partners requests further detail on how we have calculated payments to them);
If you’ve provided your consent to us providing you with information about Perlego (and which is not a service message about how to use Perlego), we will keep your contact details for a period of one year from your last activity on Perlego.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer identify or be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Reasons we can collect and use your personal information
We rely on the following as the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal information:
In some cases, we need to process your information for the purposes of performing our contract with you under our Terms of Use, or in order to help you sign up to our service. For example, providing you with access to the service and its features, customer support, taking payment, delivering content to you, managing your account, or providing you with a secure service.
If we want to email you to promote the service or books available on our platform, or to encourage you to complete a subscription, we will only do so with your active consent.  You can opt out from receiving these communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the foot of any promotional message that is sent to you or by contacting us here
help@perlego.com
.
In some cases, we need to process your information to fulfill our legal obligations. For example, to fulfill our tax and sales tax obligations.
In all other cases, we process your information because we consider it is in our legitimate interests or those of our partners (such as publishers and universities) to do so. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights (both positive and negative) before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law). Examples of this are: analyzing use of our service; reporting and research purposes; and preventing abuse of the service and the books available on it. In general terms, our legitimate interests are founded on providing our customers with a well-run, secure, efficient place for them to learn new information which helps them develop their interests, skills, and knowledge. As part of that, we have legitimate interests in running our business, finding and identifying new content for customers, measuring and improving the effectiveness of Perlego, controlling access to books, increasing and optimizing the range of books available on Perlego, and managing our relationships with our publishers, universities, and industry partners.
Transfer of your information outside of the UK/EEA
We may transfer your personal data to service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This may involve transferring personal data outside the UK and/or EEA to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK GDPR or GDPR.
Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of the UK or EEA to service providers, we guarantee that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that the required safeguards are in place, for example by using specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK and/or EEA which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK and EEA, namely the UK International Data Transfer Agreement or the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers. Our service providers may also have signed up to an approved certification scheme such as the EU/UK – US Data Privacy Framework, which would also satisfy this requirement.
We consistently monitor this transfer process to ensure compliance.
To find out more information about the safeguards that we have in place, please contact us at
help@perlego.com
.
Your rights
Under the UK GDPR and/or GDPR you have several important rights.
You have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, even though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data if you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), if we may have processed your information unlawfully, or if we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. However, please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons. This will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.
You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  You can opt out from receiving such communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the foot of any promotional communication sent to you, by unchecking the marketing consent box in Account Settings, or by contacting us at
help@perlego.com
.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have chosen, with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data accuracy;
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
For further information on how to exercise these rights, see the guidance published by the ICO here
https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/
.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please
email us at
help@perlego.com
.
Remember to let us have your Perlego account name and the email address used to sign up with the service.
We may need to request proof of your identity and address in order to comply with your request (such as a copy of your driving license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill). Finally,
please let us know the information to which your request relates.
Keeping your personal information secure
We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorized way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be fully secure and personal data is provided at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password.
