Registering to a Programme
PROGRAMME ADMISSION
General
Applicants to a programme are required to meet the entry criteria as stated in each programme overview before a registration can be processed. If you are applying to a programme and therefore registering for the first time, the verification of documentation relating to admissions criteria (for example transcripts, work references) may be required and so early registration is strongly recommended. Applications from members who do not meet the standard admission requirements in particular often require extra time for verification and processing. It is the applicant’s responsibility to submit full documentation in advance of the closing date.
Level 7 programme entry requirements
The second level educational requirements for employment in financial institutions are normally acceptable for entry (unless there are specific entry requirements stated in the programme overview). These educational requirements are five passes in the Leaving Certificate including English and Mathematics or five O Level/GCSE passes including English Language and Mathematics. Mature applicants, who are over 23 years of age on the proposed year of entry, are exempt from these entry criteria. Applicants under 23 years of age on the proposed year of entry are required to send in a copy of their Leaving Certificate/GCSE results.
Level 8 and 9 entry requirements
Level 8 and 9 entry requirements are specified under each programme. If you are using prior learning in other institutions as grounds for entry, registration is complete on receipt of an original transcript of results. A transcript of results is a formal document from an institution listing the modules studied, credits involved, grades achieved and final category of award. Note, a parchment cannot be accepted as the equivalent.
English Language requirements
IOB programmes are delivered through English and students are expected to be proficient in English. This proficiency is typically evidenced by use in the daily working environment, through passing English as a subject in the Irish Leaving Certificate Examination/equivalent, by achieving the minimum standard in a recognised English language test or through other documented verifiable means. Further information is available from Registry or
info@iob.ie
GENERAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION
In order to register to an IOB programme you must become and remain a current member of IOB (excluding Affiliate Trial Membership) (see
terms of Membership
).
Minimum Numbers
All programmes are subject to minimum numbers and IOB reserves the right to cancel a programme if there are insufficient numbers. All dates are subject to change and in such cases amended dates will be published on our
programme pages
Programme Participation
IOB programmes are largely delivered and assessed online. Students should ensure they have appropriate equipment (laptop) and that appropriate software (including MS Office: Office and Word) is available to them in order to participate in the programme and related assessments (continuous assessments and exams). Where equipment is provided by an employer, there may be security restrictions on the device which prevent downloading of apps required for exams. Further information is available from
iob.ie/info/student-info
and it is the student's responsibility to ensure they have access to a suitable device.
Programmes with in-person lectures/workshops will have that information stated on the programme page.
By enrolling on the programme, students are signing up to the academic regulations of the programme including the code of conduct, available from
iob.ie/info/student-info
If you are registering for certain joint programmes (e.g. the Professional Certificate or Diploma in Compliance, Professional Certificate in Financial Crime Prevention, Professional Certificate in Data Protection, MSc in Compliance, Graduate Diploma in Financial Planning, MSC in Financial Services, Professional Certificate in Asset Management), membership of the Compliance Institute / ITI (Irish Taxation Institute) or LIA may be required and is stated in each programme overview.
On registration a notice of confirmation of your registration will be emailed to you and posted online to
IOB Learn
you should read this to confirm that the details are correct. If not, you should inform IOB as soon as possible. If you have not received a confirmation email within 10 working days of your initial submission you should contact us at
info@iob.ie
or
+353 (0)1 611 6500
.
Method of registration:
Registrations for level 7 programmes can be made online, by post or email using the relevant registration forms, or by telephone, except where an applicant is less than 23 years of age on year of application to the programme, in which case a Leaving Certificate transcript is required. Registrations for level 8 and level 9 programmes can be made by post or email only using the relevant registration forms. In all cases the terms and conditions as set out herein apply. Module registration forms are available at
info@iob.ie
. At peak times, due to large volumes of registrations received, it can take between 5 and 10 working days to process hardcopy registration forms (online registrations are processed in real time and hence are a very efficient method of registration). We must receive complete registration forms before the registration closing dates. Submission of incomplete forms will result in delays in processing your registration and/or your form being returned to you. IOB does not accept responsibility for delays in communications sent through the postal system or the internal mail system of your employer (if applicable).
All programme fees are payable in full in advance. Partial or incomplete payment will not be accepted and registrations that do not include the correct fees will not be processed.
Recommended workload:
You can register on a module-by-module basis to your programme. If you are registering for more than one module you should ensure that you have sufficient time available to dedicate to your studies. We strongly advise you to register on time, i.e. at the start of the semester, and to carefully estimate the workload of the modules you are registering to. A 5 ECTS credit module has a notional workload of 100-125 hours approximately and a 10 ECTS credit module has a notional workload of 200-250 hours. We strongly recommend no more than 10-15 ECTS credits in a semester.
Pre-requisites and co-requisites:
Some modules within programmes have pre-requisite or co-requisite modules. If you wish to register for a module that has pre-requisite module(s) you must have passed or be exempted from the prerequisite module before you register. If you wish to register for a module that has co-requisite module(s), you must have a simultaneous registration in, have passed or have been exempted from the co-requisite module before you register.
Module scheduling:
Core modules within a programme will not be examined at the same date and/or time. However, option modules may clash and you should check the examination dates of all modules before you register.
Concurrent programme registrations:
Under UCD regulations, students may not normally be registered concurrently to more than one programme of study. Students looking to register concurrently to multiple programmes need to request permission in writing from the Head of Registry in IOB contactable at
info@iob.ie
.
Contact information:
In order for us to communicate with you it is important to ensure that your personal information is up-to-date at all times, in particular your email and mobile phone number as these are our primary methods of communicating with you about your Programme. You can update your personal information online at
iob.ie
(by logging into
IOB Learn
).
Where registrations are incomplete they will be subject to delay in processing or may be returned to you without having been processed. Registrations received after the closing date for level 8 and the late closing date in the case of level 7 will not be processed. There is no late closing date for level 7 programmes where lectures are involved.
Programmes at levels 8 and 9 have a withdrawal date, six weeks from the start of semester – no refunds of fees (examination, registration and membership) are possible after this date. There are no withdrawals after the late closing date in the case of level 7 programmes.
PRMIA
Subject as provided on the registration form, upon registration for this programme, participants will be registered to become a Contributor Member of PRMIA for 12 months from the date of confirmation of membership from PRMIA (this first 12 month subscription is included in the fee for this programme and will be paid to PRMIA on your behalf) and must commit to adhere to PRMIA Standards of Best Practice, Conduct and Ethics which can be viewed
here
. Participants who successfully complete the programme will be awarded the PRMIA Operational Risk Manager (ORM) Certificate. You can find more details about this certificate on their
website
. IOB has no responsibility for PRMIA or for the relationship between PRMIA and participants and will have no liability in contract, tort or otherwise howsoever in connection with or arising out of such relationship including any admission of or failure to admit a person to membership, or award or failure to award a certificate to any person, or any use of participants’ personal information by PRMIA.
TEXTBOOKS
We support many of our programmes with customised online textbooks.  A hard copy textbook is included for the Professional Certificate/Diploma in Financial Advice and the Professional Certificate in Consumer Credit.  For some of our other programmes a hard copy textbook is available by request.  The programme manager of the programme will advise for which programmes at the start of the trimester.   If there is a textbook for your programme or if you have requested a textbook from IOB, we will send it to you before the start of the trimester or within 10 working days of your module registration being processed. 
You are responsible for ensuring the textbook is sent to the correct address. Where an address has been amended after a registration has been made it is your responsibility to locate the textbook at the address given at the time.  We will provide our distribution company with your address and mobile number in order to deliver the textbook and to provide updates on the delivery.   
It is your responsibility to make sure that you have the most up-to-date materials for your studies, including an up-to-date textbook. You can find a copy of the most up-to-date textbook on IOB Learn  
Re-registration students can request an up-to-date textbook free of charge, they are not automatically re-issued. An electronic version of the most up-to-date textbook is available to all students registered to a module.
RE-REGISTRATIONS, DEFERRALS AND WITHDRAWALS
Resits: If you are unsuccessful in a module, you will need to re-register for the module which will involve retaking all or part of the module. For further information you should refer to the “Communication of Assessment Results/Repeats & Resits – Information for Students” document available on
iob.ie/studentinformation
. Where you are required to re-sit or repeat a module, you should re-register to the relevant module at the next available sitting. Re-registration fees for modules are payable in advance. Students should also refer to the relevant Student Handbook for details on specific implications of not completing assessments (examinations or continuous assessment), in particular for programmes at level 8 and level 9, as this may have an impact on the overall award classification on completion of the programme. Not taking an assessment, when you are registered to a module, is considered an attempt at the assessment.
Deferrals:
If you are unable to attend an examination due to extenuating circumstances, you should complete the extenuating circumstances form and submit it to the Head of Registry within 10 working days of the exam date. If approved, you will be reregistered to the NEXT available sitting of the relevant module. For further details on extenuating circumstances see
iob.ie/studentinformation
Leave of Absence:
As a registered student on a programme, you are expected to study for a minimum of one module per semester/term. If you wish to take a break for a semester, you are required to formally request a Leave of Absence in advance of the semester and should contact the relevant programme manager for relevant information. Note that on return from a Leave of Absence, you are governed by IOB’s Rules, Regulations, Codes and policies and procedures in place on your return. You are also subject to the programme curriculum and programme requirements in place for the programme on return. The Institute cannot guarantee that the same modules available prior to or during a leave of absence period(s) will be available when you return.
Withdrawal:
You are considered registered to a programme unless you formally withdraw. To withdraw from a programme, you should contact the relevant programme manager for a Withdrawal Form.
EXAMINATION REGULATIONS
You are advised that the conduct of the examinations is governed by the Examination Regulations of IOB. You must read these regulations and related procedures, available at
iob.ie/studentinformation

7.2 You may not resell or transfer your ticket. In addition, Event Partners may prohibit the resale or transfer of tickets for some events.

REFUNDS
9.1 Occasionally, events are cancelled, rescheduled or materially altered by IOB, speaker or Event Partner for a variety of reasons.
Contact us
for exact instructions.

9.4 Material alteration: If an event is materially altered, you will be offered an option to either reconfirm your order for the altered event or to claim a refund (of the sale price of your ticket(s) but excluding any third party order processing fee, within such time as specified by us. Failure to inform us of your decision may result in your order being reconfirmed for the altered event and you will not be entitled to claim a refund.
