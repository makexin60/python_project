Pursuant to the GDPR, the controller is the natural or legal person which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they are joint controllers. The joint controllers relating to the activities of the site are:LN-CC Italia S.R.L., Piazza Arcole 4, 20143 Milan, Italy; contact: privacy.ln-cc@thelevelgroup.com THE LEVEL S.R.L. , Piazza Arcole 4, 20143 Milan, Italy; contact details: privacy@thelevelgroup.com (the “Joint Controllers”).

The Joint Controllers may also verify that payment instruments used by customers for purchases on the Site (e.g. credit or debit cards, etc.) are valid, mainly to prevent fraud or to fulfil statutory anti-money laundering obligations. Since this activity is delegated to duly authorized third parties, the Joint Controllers do not process or store financial information relating to customers and payment instruments.

The Joint Controllers do not monitor or manage these social media services or user profiles on these social media services, nor do the Joint Controllers establish the personal data protection settings or the rules regarding the methods of use of personal data on these social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, or other). Users are strongly encouraged to read any information published by the managers of these services concerning the protection of personal data to obtain further information on the methods of processing personal data through these channels.

Site users can opt to receive newsletters and marketing communications. The Joint Controllers collect users’ freely given, express, and unequivocal consent before sending them newsletters and marketing communications or, more generally, before undertaking dedicated marketing initiatives.

Users may at any time withdraw their consent to receive newsletters and marketing communications: - In their account settings - By clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an email - By contacting our customer service representatives. The legal basis for the processing of personal data in this case is the data subject’s consent to the processing of his/her personal data.
PROFILING
