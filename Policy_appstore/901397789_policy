1. Types of personal data
In terms of App usage, the associated household appliances or services and functions offered by Home Connect (hereinafter "Services") Home Connect collects, processes and uses the following categories of personal data.
User master data and usage data
Below we describe how we collect and use our personal data when setting up a user account (registration) as well as when setting up the App. This data is stored into your account and this account is personal and non-transferable.
When registering with the SingleKey ID:
Access data, i.e. identification data that serves to control access to the SingleKey ID user account and consists of the user ID (e.g. email address or mobile phone number of the user). Responsible for providing this registration service is Bosch.IO GmbH, Bosch.IO GmbH, Ullsteinstrasse 128, 12109 Berlin, Germany ("BIO").
Additional details that you provide during the registration process including the setting up of the app or registration of a central BSH user account, (as long as they are not transmitted via the SingleKey ID), such as:
first and last name,
email address (will also be used as the user ID),
the country in which you operate your household appliance(s),
password as access protection for the App/the central BSH user account.
The details requested as part of the registration process may differ from country to country and are managed (if available) via a central BSH user account, which can also be used as Home Connect account.
Information which we collect and store during the registration process and while using the App:
language setting of your mobile device,
system settings related to the app (e.g. permission to send in-app messages)
consent to and recognition of the terms of use
acknowledgement of the data protection information,
marketing consent(s) and its scope,
status of the user account (activated/deactivated),
default app tracking setting (depending on the selection of country, see item 6 below for more information),
Service history (e.g. service technician assignment) of the connected household appliances as well as related orders of the user (e.g. consumables).
"Detergent Scan": if this service is available for your appliance and you use it, we store the respective water hardness and the detergent used by you stored in the app, a "detergent history" is created in the app (and this history can be deleted by you at any time);
the approximate device location derived from the zip code or shortened IP address (e.g., at the municipality level) to improve the user experience, e.g., by helping to set location-based device settings (such as water hardness in your region or local time zone).
The content you upload to the Home Connect app (including, but not limited to, recipes, recipe images, including their labels), including the information required for you to share the content with third parties (e.g., your name as the creator of the recipe). If you, as a user, wish to share your own recipes with others, you must create a separate cooking profile for that purpose and choose a name and avatar for the profile, which will then be displayed with your shared recipe. The name and avatar do not have to relate to you as a person, so it can also be an alias.
Appliance master data
The data we collect and use concerning the connection between your household appliance and the user account are as follows:
brand of the household appliance (e.g. Bosch or Siemens),
serial number and, if applicable, manufacture date of the appliance (so-called E number (full model) and FD (production) number – you can also find these details on the appliance label),
the unique identifier of the network adapter installed in the household appliance (so-called MAC address).
additional programs (if you have purchased additional programs for your home appliance that were provided via the Home Connect app, these additional programs are linked to the home appliance and not to the user account and therefore remain in the home appliance, but not in your user account if you sell or otherwise transfer the home appliance. Additional programs are generally not transferable to other home appliances).
These data are allocated to your user account for each connected household appliance under the "Home Connect" function.
Appliance usage data
The data we collect and use in relation to the usage of the household appliance are as follows:
selected basic settings, program selection and preferred program settings on the household appliance or via the App,
appliance status data such as ambient conditions, condition of parts, changes of appliance status (e.g. different mode of operation, open or closed doors/front panel, temperature changes, fill levels) and appliance status messages (e.g. appliance is overheated, water tank is empty, etc.) as well as error messages (including the respective error report of the affected household appliance).
individual settings/contents of the household appliance including free-text fields (e.g. internal digital map for vacuum cleaner robots, beverage name for coffee machines, downloaded or self-designed recipes).
video and image data (e.g. vacuum cleaner robots, stoves and ovens as well as refrigerators with built-in cameras) used for various functions of the respective home appliance, such as imaging the contents of the refrigerator (Camera in the Fridge) or detecting the degree of browning (Camera in the Oven).
If you allow another user (regardless of whether via their own account or via your account) to use home appliances via the app, the appliance usage data created by the additional user will also be stored.
App related usage data
App related usage data are data generated by your interaction within the App, such as the features you use, click behaviour relevant to App controls, drop-down menu selections, on/off switch settings, information from A/B and multi-variant tests (i.e., from tests of how different versions of our app are accepted by the respective user in order to thus achieve an improvement in the user experience) and error reports of the app as well as interactions of your app with third-party applications (e.g. web pages that you open from within the app). See item 6 for more information.
2. Purpose of use
We use the above-mentioned category of data
to provide App features as well as the services offered via the App as well as providing updates for your device (1.a.-c.),
for notification purposes in case of safety instructions and/or recall information in the context of product monitoring (1.a. to c.),
for proactive maintenance purposes, including the provision of related in-app/email messages (e.g. recommendations on the use of settings and/or maintenance programs or anomalies that indicate a major malfunction of the home appliance in the near future, which may be avoided by taking appropriate precautionary measures, e.g. if vibrations in the home appliance indicate an imbalance that can damage the appliance) and reactive troubleshooting (e.g. in the context of remote diagnosis, during on-site repair or at the repair center) of the connected household appliances (1.a. to c.),
to improve the App's user friendliness (including the interaction of app and home appliance) and for specific or general troubleshooting of the App and the digital services offered through it (1. c. and d.),
to improve our range of products and services (including those of affiliated companies), especially with regard to the usage of the home appliances (e.g. programs which are not used and/or which are frequently used), as well as other features of the App and household appliance (including algorithmic learning e.g. to improve the detection of the level of contents stored in refrigerators or the degree of browning in the oven) (1.c. and d.),
for billing purposes, insofar the household appliances are connected to the App or the services offered in the App provide for usage-based billing (1.a. to c.), and
for marketing and market research purposes including in-app/email messages (1.a. to c.) as far as a corresponding consent is given;
Name, contact details and appliance master data (including customer service transaction data) are kept in a separate "Safety Action" database, e.g. to perform product recalls;
in anonymized form for statistics on the use of connected home appliance for use by HomeConnect and its affiliates for internal purposes and in the context of general communications, including social media (1.c anonymized).
The legal bases for the purposes of processing within the scope of the GDPR (REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016) are described in item 12 of this information.
Regarding other data transfers within the Bosch Group associated with the central SingleKey ID, we refer to the BIO data protection information at
https://singlekey-id.com/en/data-protection-notice/
.
3. General retention periods
Provided there are no statutory provisions to the contrary, the following general retention periods shall apply:
SingleKey ID:
Deletion with deletion of the SingleKey ID user account.
User master data:
Deletion as soon as the local user account or the central BSH account is deleted.
Appliance master data:
Removal of link to the user account upon removing the household appliance from the user account.
Appliance usage data:
User-specific storage for a period of thirty (30) days. Afterwards storage in pseudonymized form (in a special database using a pseudonymisation algorithm) and provision in personalized form for services and/or repair services provided via the App or by on-site / repair service (e.g. proactive or reactive maintenance/troubleshooting, if available) for the duration of the validity of the contract or (if the function can be disabled) for the duration of the activation of the function. Furthermore, in pseudonymized form based on our legitimate interest, as long as our legitimate interest prevails, afterwards, in anonymized form. Insofar as you have shared content with third parties, this is not deleted, but remains on the appliance and/or end devices of the third parties with whom you have shared the content.
App related usage data:
Storage in pseudonymised form and provision in personalized form for services/messages provided via the App to the extent that the "Enable usage-data tracking" function is activated. Deactivating the function resets the individual ID used for tracking, so that App usage data already collected can no longer be connected to you.
Name, contact details and device master data (including customer service transaction data):
Stored in personal form for a period of 30 years in a separate "Safety Action" database, held there solely for these purposes, e.g., to conduct product recalls.
If you sell the home appliance, please note that you must reset your home appliance to its factory settings before deleting the SingleKey ID or the app. If you have allowed the use of a home appliance together with another app user who does not use his own account, the deletion of your account also triggers the deletion of the other user. If you have allowed the use of a home device together with another app user who uses his own account, please note that the deletion of your account does not trigger the deletion of the additional user at the same time. If you do not want the other user to be able to continue using the home appliance via the app, please also arrange for the deletion of the other user. If such deletion does not take place, the previously collected appliance master data and appliance usage data will remain available for the additional user.
4. Data processing management
Connectivity of your household appliance
You can use the App to manage the connectivity of your household appliance:
If required and if your household appliance provides for this function, you can set up the connection to the Home Connect server in such a way that each household appliance is connected separately (menu item Appliances → Settings). After doing this:
the appliance usage data (1.c.) will no longer be transmitted to the Home Connect server; if your home appliance is equipped with buffer memory, the appliance usage data will be transmitted to the Home Connect Server in the event that the Wi-Fi connection of your household appliance to the Home Connect Server is restored;
certain App features will no longer be available; in particular the household appliance can then not be operated, even if an internet data link is set up.
If required, you can switch off the Wi-Fi connection for an individual household appliance (menu item Appliances → Settings). After doing this:
the appliance usage data (1.c.) will no longer be transmitted to the Home Connect server; if your household appliance is equipped with a buffer memory, the appliance usage data will be transmitted to the Home Connect Server, in the event that the Wi-Fi connection of your household appliance is restored.
the household appliance may only be operated from the appliance itself, not via the App.
User accounts and local App data
You can manage your user accounts via the App and delete locally stored App data.
You can delete your user account ("Profile" → "Personal Data" → "Delete account"). After doing this:
the connection between your household appliance and your user account will be deleted,
your household appliance will no longer send any appliance usage data to the Home Connect server provided no other user accounts are linked to the household appliance (see item 1.a. above).
By deleting the App or using the “Full reset”-function, all locally stored user-related data will be removed, but not the accounts which were created separately.
• If you use the SingleKey ID, the SingleKey ID account will be deleted via the SingleKey ID functions, whereby in addition to the SingleKey ID itself, individual linked applications can also be deleted. If the SingleKey ID is the only access mechanism to the app/to the central BSH user account, the deletion of the SingleKey ID may make access to the linked services impossible. Therefore, before deleting the SingleKey ID, please check if you still have linked applications/user accounts.
To delete the central BSH user account, please use the function provided in the account.
Some features of the App do not store user-related data locally. You can have such data deleted by reaching out to the Home Connect Service Hotline or (possibly at a later date) by using the corresponding function in the App.
The content you uploaded to the Home Connect app (in particular recipes, recipe images). If you have shared content with third parties, this content will remain on the third party's appliance and/or even if you delete the data locally.
The household appliance's factory settings
You can reset your household appliance to its factory settings. After doing this:
the household appliance will lose its connection to the Home Connect server due to the network settings being reset,
the household appliance will no longer be linked to any previously associated user account (requires the household appliance to be connected to the Internet) and it will not be displayed in the App
and all contents stored on the household appliance will be deleted.
Please read your household appliance's user manual before restoring the factory settings.
5. Transmission or disclosure of your data to third parties
We work together with various service providers to create and run the App and provide the respective services. To the extent that we have bound these service providers to process data in line with strict instructions in their capacity as data processors on our behalf, any data processing activities undertaken by such providers shall not require your consent.
The service providers we have commissioned to create and run the App:
Service providers for hosting services
Service providers for programming services
Service providers for hotline services (also if performed via a chat-function or similar communication channels) and other App services
We only transmit your data to other recipients where necessary to fulfil a contract with you or between you and the third party, where we or the recipient has a legitimate interest in the disclosure of your data, or where you have given your consent to that transmission. These recipients include service providers and other companies within our corporate group. Furthermore, data may be transmitted to other recipients in the event that we are obliged to do so due to legal provisions or enforceable administrative or court orders.
Other recipients of your data are especially such service providers whose offers and services (third-party services) can be used in connection with the App or where the App enables access to such services (see item 9).
Content, especially recipes, which you have created yourself, may also be transmitted to other BSH companies (also internationally) within the scope of technical processing and provision of the content/services. We base such transmission/processing on data protection agreements between the BSH companies involved, which also include the application of standard contractual clauses, insofar as the transmission includes a country outside the scope of the GDPR and if it’s not a case of Art. 45 GDPR.
6. Recording App usage
Data on App related usage can be recorded by the App (see item 1.d. above) where, depending on your country of residence and operating system, your consent is obtained accordingly or you have the option to change consent once it has been activated, as described below. For the recording of App related usage data, the following Analytics services are used, which is offered by
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland (hereinafter "Adobe")
Adjust Tools by Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin (hereinafter „Adjust“).
Thunderhead Analytics by Thunderhead Ltd., 5th Floor, Ingeni Building, 17 Broadwick Street, Soho, London W1F 0DJ (hereinafter “Thunderhead”).
Optimizely Inc., 631 Howard Street, Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94105, United States, (hereinafter “Optimizely”).
If the "Enable usage-data tracking" function is activated, App related usage data will be sent to and stored on servers of providers located in the European Union. The App related usage data enable you to analyse how you use the App and provide messages (inApp or email) to you for services provided via the App (see item 1.d. above). IP anonymisation is activated for this App, which means that the IP address you use is truncated before being sent to the server. The analytics providers will use this information on behalf of Home Connect to evaluate how you use the App, generate error reports and to prepare reports on App activity for Home Connect. A/B and multi-variant tests are performed on our behalf by Optimizely. For this purpose, app-related usage data is collected, transmitted to a server of Optimizely and stored and processed there.
Such analysis serves as a basis for us to improve the app itself, to better understand and improve app usage and the connection of home devices, but also to provide contextual content in the app and on websites you use. In order to provide contextual content, we build typical usage profiles (so-called "audiences") that enable us to provide such content in a way that is appropriate for you.
IP addresses transmitted from your mobile device and other personal data within the context of the aforementioned analytics activities will not be merged with other data held by analytics providers or Home Connect without your consent given separately.
You can control whether or not App related usage data (incl. your IP address) is recorded and processed by one of the abovementioned providers by activating or deactivating this in the personal settings within the app or in the corresponding system menu of your mobile device. Depending on the legal situation in your country, the analytics and/or tracking function may be activated by default, but you may change these settings to your personal preferences.
In addition, error reports from the app can be sent to us so that we can take concrete measures to eliminate such errors. These fault reports are used on a personalized basis to analyze and correct the error in the event of a specific error report from you. Without direct personal reference, error reports are used to eliminate errors in general for all users of the app and to avoid future errors as far as possible.
If covered by a separately declared consent (e.g. a marketing consent given by you via the website), we may also use the app-related usage data within the scope of this consent to personalize the corresponding (marketing) communication to you and your interests. In the context of such consent, we also inform you in each case about such possible use.
7. Error reports
We use tools (e.g. Visual Studio App Center
https://appcenter.ms
) to collect and send anonymous error reports if the App performs as not intended and/or behaves in an unexpected way, especially if the App crashes. Our service providers and Home Connect shall receive error reports only with your explicit consent. We shall ask for your consent each time we wish to transmit such information.
8. Data security
We deploy technical and organisational measures to protect your data, for example, from manipulation, loss and unauthorised third-party access. These measures include the use of encoding technologies, certificates, firewalls on the Home Connect servers and password protection in the Home Connect App.
9. Scope of application of the data protection information
This data protection information shall apply for the functions and services offered by Home Connect via the App. Insofar as additional functions or services are offered within the App by Home Connect or a BSH Group company, special information on data protection is provided, insofar as their use is subject to special data protection regulations or information.
However this data protection information shall not apply for third-party services, even if Home Connect facilitates the use of and/or access to such third-party services in the App (please also see the terms of use with regard to third-party services). The use of such third-party services is governed by the prevailing data protection provisions put in place by the third-party service provider and, if applicable, additional data protection information on our part which outline the distinctive features of these third-party services and shall only be relevant in this regard.
If you are referred to another service provider, Home Connect shall make reasonable and appropriate efforts to elucidate such referral (e.g. by embedding the service provider's content within the App using inline frames) if such referral is not clear. If you click on a link in the Home Connect App which calls up an app or website of another service provider, this is considered to be a clear referral.
If you, the user, are located within the scope of application of the GDPR, please note that the use of third-party services may result in your personal data being processed in countries outside the scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation. Please then refer to the data protection information of the respective third-party service providers.
10. Changes to the data protection information
As the App and the services provided via the App continues to undergo development – among other things, through the implementation of new technologies or the introduction of new services – this data protection information may need to be adjusted accordingly. Home Connect shall reserve the right to amend or supplement this information as required. Home Connect will always update the data protection information in the App; you can therefore familiarise yourself with the latest version at any time.
11. Rights and contact information
If, despite our efforts to only store data which is correct and up-to-date, your personal details are stored incorrectly, we shall correct such information upon your request. After giving us your consent for the collection, processing and use of your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any time with effect for the future. Consent may generally be withdrawn using the respective App setting or otherwise through the contact information referred to in the App.
Your personal data will be deleted if you withdraw your consent to your data being stored, if your personal data is no longer needed to serve the purpose pursued by such storage or if such storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. Please bear in mind that, for technical or organisational reasons, there may be an overlap between you withdrawing your consent and your data being used, e.g. in the case of a newsletter which has already been sent out. Data required for billing and accountancy purposes or which are subject to the legal duty to preserve records are not affected by this.
Should you have any questions on the topic of data protection or should you wish to exercise your rights to withdraw consent or to information, rectification, deletion or suspension, please contact us using the contact information provided in the App.

1. Types of personal data
In terms of App usage, the associated household appliances or services and functions offered by Home Connect (hereinafter "Services") Home Connect collects, processes and uses the following categories of personal data.
User master data and usage data
Below we describe how we collect and use our personal data when setting up a user account (registration) as well as when setting up the App. This data is stored into your account and this account is personal and non-transferable.
When registering with the SingleKey ID:
Access data, i.e. identification data that serves to control access to the SingleKey ID user account and consists of the user ID (e.g. email address or mobile phone number of the user). Responsible for providing this registration service is Bosch.IO GmbH, Bosch.IO GmbH, Ullsteinstrasse 128, 12109 Berlin, Germany ("BIO").
Additional details that you provide during the registration process including the setting up of the app or registration of a central BSH user account, (as long as they are not transmitted via the SingleKey ID), such as:
first and last name,
email address (will also be used as the user ID),
the country in which you operate your household appliance(s),
password as access protection for the App/the central BSH user account.
The details requested as part of the registration process may differ from country to country and are managed (if available) via a central BSH user account, which can also be used as Home Connect account.
Information which we collect and store during the registration process and while using the App:
language setting of your mobile device,
system settings related to the app (e.g. permission to send in-app messages)
consent to and recognition of the terms of use
acknowledgement of the data protection information,
marketing consent(s) and its scope,
status of the user account (activated/deactivated),
default app tracking setting (depending on the selection of country, see item 6 below for more information),
Service history (e.g. service technician assignment) of the connected household appliances as well as related orders of the user (e.g. consumables).
"Detergent Scan": if this service is available for your appliance and you use it, we store the respective water hardness and the detergent used by you stored in the app, a "detergent history" is created in the app (and this history can be deleted by you at any time);
the approximate device location derived from the zip code or shortened IP address (e.g., at the municipality level) to improve the user experience, e.g., by helping to set location-based device settings (such as water hardness in your region or local time zone).
The content you upload to the Home Connect app (including, but not limited to, recipes, recipe images, including their labels), including the information required for you to share the content with third parties (e.g., your name as the creator of the recipe). If you, as a user, wish to share your own recipes with others, you must create a separate cooking profile for that purpose and choose a name and avatar for the profile, which will then be displayed with your shared recipe. The name and avatar do not have to relate to you as a person, so it can also be an alias.
Appliance master data
The data we collect and use concerning the connection between your household appliance and the user account are as follows:
brand of the household appliance (e.g. Bosch or Siemens),
serial number and, if applicable, manufacture date of the appliance (so-called E number (full model) and FD (production) number – you can also find these details on the appliance label),
the unique identifier of the network adapter installed in the household appliance (so-called MAC address).
additional programs (if you have purchased additional programs for your home appliance that were provided via the Home Connect app, these additional programs are linked to the home appliance and not to the user account and therefore remain in the home appliance, but not in your user account if you sell or otherwise transfer the home appliance. Additional programs are generally not transferable to other home appliances).
These data are allocated to your user account for each connected household appliance under the "Home Connect" function.
Appliance usage data
The data we collect and use in relation to the usage of the household appliance are as follows:
selected basic settings, program selection and preferred program settings on the household appliance or via the App,
appliance status data such as ambient conditions, condition of parts, changes of appliance status (e.g. different mode of operation, open or closed doors/front panel, temperature changes, fill levels) and appliance status messages (e.g. appliance is overheated, water tank is empty, etc.) as well as error messages (including the respective error report of the affected household appliance).
individual settings/contents of the household appliance including free-text fields (e.g. internal digital map for vacuum cleaner robots, beverage name for coffee machines, downloaded or self-designed recipes).
video and image data (e.g. vacuum cleaner robots, stoves and ovens as well as refrigerators with built-in cameras) used for various functions of the respective home appliance, such as imaging the contents of the refrigerator (Camera in the Fridge) or detecting the degree of browning (Camera in the Oven).
If you allow another user (regardless of whether via their own account or via your account) to use home appliances via the app, the appliance usage data created by the additional user will also be stored.
App related usage data
App related usage data are data generated by your interaction within the App, such as the features you use, click behaviour relevant to App controls, drop-down menu selections, on/off switch settings, information from A/B and multi-variant tests (i.e., from tests of how different versions of our app are accepted by the respective user in order to thus achieve an improvement in the user experience) and error reports of the app as well as interactions of your app with third-party applications (e.g. web pages that you open from within the app). See item 6 for more information.
2. Purpose of use
We use the above-mentioned category of data
to provide App features as well as the services offered via the App as well as providing updates for your device (1.a.-c.),
for notification purposes in case of safety instructions and/or recall information in the context of product monitoring (1.a. to c.),
for proactive maintenance purposes, including the provision of related in-app/email messages (e.g. recommendations on the use of settings and/or maintenance programs or anomalies that indicate a major malfunction of the home appliance in the near future, which may be avoided by taking appropriate precautionary measures, e.g. if vibrations in the home appliance indicate an imbalance that can damage the appliance) and reactive troubleshooting (e.g. in the context of remote diagnosis, during on-site repair or at the repair center) of the connected household appliances (1.a. to c.),
to improve the App's user friendliness (including the interaction of app and home appliance) and for specific or general troubleshooting of the App and the digital services offered through it (1. c. and d.),
to improve our range of products and services (including those of affiliated companies), especially with regard to the usage of the home appliances (e.g. programs which are not used and/or which are frequently used), as well as other features of the App and household appliance (including algorithmic learning e.g. to improve the detection of the level of contents stored in refrigerators or the degree of browning in the oven) (1.c. and d.),
for billing purposes, insofar the household appliances are connected to the App or the services offered in the App provide for usage-based billing (1.a. to c.), and
for marketing and market research purposes including in-app/email messages (1.a. to c.) as far as a corresponding consent is given;
Name, contact details and appliance master data (including customer service transaction data) are kept in a separate "Safety Action" database, e.g. to perform product recalls;
in anonymized form for statistics on the use of connected home appliance for use by HomeConnect and its affiliates for internal purposes and in the context of general communications, including social media (1.c anonymized).
The legal bases for the purposes of processing within the scope of the GDPR (REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016) are described in item 12 of this information.
Regarding other data transfers within the Bosch Group associated with the central SingleKey ID, we refer to the BIO data protection information at
https://singlekey-id.com/en/data-protection-notice/
.
3. General retention periods
Provided there are no statutory provisions to the contrary, the following general retention periods shall apply:
SingleKey ID:
Deletion with deletion of the SingleKey ID user account.
User master data:
Deletion as soon as the local user account or the central BSH account is deleted.
Appliance master data:
Removal of link to the user account upon removing the household appliance from the user account.
Appliance usage data:
User-specific storage for a period of thirty (30) days. Afterwards storage in pseudonymized form (in a special database using a pseudonymisation algorithm) and provision in personalized form for services and/or repair services provided via the App or by on-site / repair service (e.g. proactive or reactive maintenance/troubleshooting, if available) for the duration of the validity of the contract or (if the function can be disabled) for the duration of the activation of the function. Furthermore, in pseudonymized form based on our legitimate interest, as long as our legitimate interest prevails, afterwards, in anonymized form. Insofar as you have shared content with third parties, this is not deleted, but remains on the appliance and/or end devices of the third parties with whom you have shared the content.
App related usage data:
Storage in pseudonymised form and provision in personalized form for services/messages provided via the App to the extent that the "Enable usage-data tracking" function is activated. Deactivating the function resets the individual ID used for tracking, so that App usage data already collected can no longer be connected to you.
Name, contact details and device master data (including customer service transaction data):
Stored in personal form for a period of 30 years in a separate "Safety Action" database, held there solely for these purposes, e.g., to conduct product recalls.
If you sell the home appliance, please note that you must reset your home appliance to its factory settings before deleting the SingleKey ID or the app. If you have allowed the use of a home appliance together with another app user who does not use his own account, the deletion of your account also triggers the deletion of the other user. If you have allowed the use of a home device together with another app user who uses his own account, please note that the deletion of your account does not trigger the deletion of the additional user at the same time. If you do not want the other user to be able to continue using the home appliance via the app, please also arrange for the deletion of the other user. If such deletion does not take place, the previously collected appliance master data and appliance usage data will remain available for the additional user.
4. Data processing management
Connectivity of your household appliance
You can use the App to manage the connectivity of your household appliance:
If required and if your household appliance provides for this function, you can set up the connection to the Home Connect server in such a way that each household appliance is connected separately (menu item Appliances → Settings). After doing this:
the appliance usage data (1.c.) will no longer be transmitted to the Home Connect server; if your home appliance is equipped with buffer memory, the appliance usage data will be transmitted to the Home Connect Server in the event that the Wi-Fi connection of your household appliance to the Home Connect Server is restored;
certain App features will no longer be available; in particular the household appliance can then not be operated, even if an internet data link is set up.
If required, you can switch off the Wi-Fi connection for an individual household appliance (menu item Appliances → Settings). After doing this:
the appliance usage data (1.c.) will no longer be transmitted to the Home Connect server; if your household appliance is equipped with a buffer memory, the appliance usage data will be transmitted to the Home Connect Server, in the event that the Wi-Fi connection of your household appliance is restored.
the household appliance may only be operated from the appliance itself, not via the App.
User accounts and local App data
You can manage your user accounts via the App and delete locally stored App data.
You can delete your user account ("Profile" → "Personal Data" → "Delete account"). After doing this:
the connection between your household appliance and your user account will be deleted,
your household appliance will no longer send any appliance usage data to the Home Connect server provided no other user accounts are linked to the household appliance (see item 1.a. above).
By deleting the App or using the “Full reset”-function, all locally stored user-related data will be removed, but not the accounts which were created separately.
• If you use the SingleKey ID, the SingleKey ID account will be deleted via the SingleKey ID functions, whereby in addition to the SingleKey ID itself, individual linked applications can also be deleted. If the SingleKey ID is the only access mechanism to the app/to the central BSH user account, the deletion of the SingleKey ID may make access to the linked services impossible. Therefore, before deleting the SingleKey ID, please check if you still have linked applications/user accounts.
To delete the central BSH user account, please use the function provided in the account.
Some features of the App do not store user-related data locally. You can have such data deleted by reaching out to the Home Connect Service Hotline or (possibly at a later date) by using the corresponding function in the App.
The content you uploaded to the Home Connect app (in particular recipes, recipe images). If you have shared content with third parties, this content will remain on the third party's appliance and/or even if you delete the data locally.
The household appliance's factory settings
You can reset your household appliance to its factory settings. After doing this:
the household appliance will lose its connection to the Home Connect server due to the network settings being reset,
the household appliance will no longer be linked to any previously associated user account (requires the household appliance to be connected to the Internet) and it will not be displayed in the App
and all contents stored on the household appliance will be deleted.
Please read your household appliance's user manual before restoring the factory settings.
5. Transmission or disclosure of your data to third parties
We work together with various service providers to create and run the App and provide the respective services. To the extent that we have bound these service providers to process data in line with strict instructions in their capacity as data processors on our behalf, any data processing activities undertaken by such providers shall not require your consent.
The service providers we have commissioned to create and run the App:
Service providers for hosting services
Service providers for programming services
Service providers for hotline services (also if performed via a chat-function or similar communication channels) and other App services
We only transmit your data to other recipients where necessary to fulfil a contract with you or between you and the third party, where we or the recipient has a legitimate interest in the disclosure of your data, or where you have given your consent to that transmission. These recipients include service providers and other companies within our corporate group. Furthermore, data may be transmitted to other recipients in the event that we are obliged to do so due to legal provisions or enforceable administrative or court orders.
Other recipients of your data are especially such service providers whose offers and services (third-party services) can be used in connection with the App or where the App enables access to such services (see item 9).
Content, especially recipes, which you have created yourself, may also be transmitted to other BSH companies (also internationally) within the scope of technical processing and provision of the content/services. We base such transmission/processing on data protection agreements between the BSH companies involved, which also include the application of standard contractual clauses, insofar as the transmission includes a country outside the scope of the GDPR and if it’s not a case of Art. 45 GDPR.
6. Recording App usage
Data on App related usage can be recorded by the App (see item 1.d. above) where, depending on your country of residence and operating system, your consent is obtained accordingly or you have the option to change consent once it has been activated, as described below. For the recording of App related usage data, the following Analytics services are used, which is offered by
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland (hereinafter "Adobe")
Adjust Tools by Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin (hereinafter „Adjust“).
Thunderhead Analytics by Thunderhead Ltd., 5th Floor, Ingeni Building, 17 Broadwick Street, Soho, London W1F 0DJ (hereinafter “Thunderhead”).
Optimizely Inc., 631 Howard Street, Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94105, United States, (hereinafter “Optimizely”).
If the "Enable usage-data tracking" function is activated, App related usage data will be sent to and stored on servers of providers located in the European Union. The App related usage data enable you to analyse how you use the App and provide messages (inApp or email) to you for services provided via the App (see item 1.d. above). IP anonymisation is activated for this App, which means that the IP address you use is truncated before being sent to the server. The analytics providers will use this information on behalf of Home Connect to evaluate how you use the App, generate error reports and to prepare reports on App activity for Home Connect. A/B and multi-variant tests are performed on our behalf by Optimizely. For this purpose, app-related usage data is collected, transmitted to a server of Optimizely and stored and processed there.
Such analysis serves as a basis for us to improve the app itself, to better understand and improve app usage and the connection of home devices, but also to provide contextual content in the app and on websites you use. In order to provide contextual content, we build typical usage profiles (so-called "audiences") that enable us to provide such content in a way that is appropriate for you.
IP addresses transmitted from your mobile device and other personal data within the context of the aforementioned analytics activities will not be merged with other data held by analytics providers or Home Connect without your consent given separately.
You can control whether or not App related usage data (incl. your IP address) is recorded and processed by one of the abovementioned providers by activating or deactivating this in the personal settings within the app or in the corresponding system menu of your mobile device. Depending on the legal situation in your country, the analytics and/or tracking function may be activated by default, but you may change these settings to your personal preferences.
In addition, error reports from the app can be sent to us so that we can take concrete measures to eliminate such errors. These fault reports are used on a personalized basis to analyze and correct the error in the event of a specific error report from you. Without direct personal reference, error reports are used to eliminate errors in general for all users of the app and to avoid future errors as far as possible.
If covered by a separately declared consent (e.g. a marketing consent given by you via the website), we may also use the app-related usage data within the scope of this consent to personalize the corresponding (marketing) communication to you and your interests. In the context of such consent, we also inform you in each case about such possible use.
7. Error reports
We use tools (e.g. Visual Studio App Center
https://appcenter.ms
) to collect and send anonymous error reports if the App performs as not intended and/or behaves in an unexpected way, especially if the App crashes. Our service providers and Home Connect shall receive error reports only with your explicit consent. We shall ask for your consent each time we wish to transmit such information.
8. Data security
We deploy technical and organisational measures to protect your data, for example, from manipulation, loss and unauthorised third-party access. These measures include the use of encoding technologies, certificates, firewalls on the Home Connect servers and password protection in the Home Connect App.
9. Scope of application of the data protection information
This data protection information shall apply for the functions and services offered by Home Connect via the App. Insofar as additional functions or services are offered within the App by Home Connect or a BSH Group company, special information on data protection is provided, insofar as their use is subject to special data protection regulations or information.
However this data protection information shall not apply for third-party services, even if Home Connect facilitates the use of and/or access to such third-party services in the App (please also see the terms of use with regard to third-party services). The use of such third-party services is governed by the prevailing data protection provisions put in place by the third-party service provider and, if applicable, additional data protection information on our part which outline the distinctive features of these third-party services and shall only be relevant in this regard.
If you are referred to another service provider, Home Connect shall make reasonable and appropriate efforts to elucidate such referral (e.g. by embedding the service provider's content within the App using inline frames) if such referral is not clear. If you click on a link in the Home Connect App which calls up an app or website of another service provider, this is considered to be a clear referral.
If you, the user, are located within the scope of application of the GDPR, please note that the use of third-party services may result in your personal data being processed in countries outside the scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation. Please then refer to the data protection information of the respective third-party service providers.
10. Changes to the data protection information
As the App and the services provided via the App continues to undergo development – among other things, through the implementation of new technologies or the introduction of new services – this data protection information may need to be adjusted accordingly. Home Connect shall reserve the right to amend or supplement this information as required. Home Connect will always update the data protection information in the App; you can therefore familiarise yourself with the latest version at any time.
11. Rights and contact information
If, despite our efforts to only store data which is correct and up-to-date, your personal details are stored incorrectly, we shall correct such information upon your request. After giving us your consent for the collection, processing and use of your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any time with effect for the future. Consent may generally be withdrawn using the respective App setting or otherwise through the contact information referred to in the App.
Your personal data will be deleted if you withdraw your consent to your data being stored, if your personal data is no longer needed to serve the purpose pursued by such storage or if such storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. Please bear in mind that, for technical or organisational reasons, there may be an overlap between you withdrawing your consent and your data being used, e.g. in the case of a newsletter which has already been sent out. Data required for billing and accountancy purposes or which are subject to the legal duty to preserve records are not affected by this.
Should you have any questions on the topic of data protection or should you wish to exercise your rights to withdraw consent or to information, rectification, deletion or suspension, please contact us using the contact information provided in the App.

About us and our website
We, Home Connect GmbH, Carl-Wery-Str. 34, 81739 Munich, Germany, operate this website. Please use the contact information provided on the Company Information page to contact us.
If you get in touch with us, we will store and process the information you provide for the purpose of handling your enquiry and any follow-up questions. We are permitted to process data in this context by law (article 6(1b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679). We will delete your information once your enquiry has been handled.
Our guiding principles
We take protecting your information very seriously. Your data is therefore processed with great care and in strict compliance with applicable data protection law. Organisational and technical security measures have been taken to protect all of our websites against the risks present in processing personal data. Our partners who support us in the provision of this website must comply with these provisions as well.
What we log as standard
Web server log data
You can use all the areas of our website that are not access-protected without disclosing your identity. We log every use of our website as standard in order to remedy faults and clarify security incidents. You can find more about our log data in the section "How we process your data".
Which permissions do we have to process your data
We respect your privacy. Consequently, we only process your data when we are permitted to do so. It goes without saying that you can also give us permission to process your data by opting in to data processing on our website. In other cases, we process your data because we are permitted to do so by law. If, for example, you place an order through our website, we are permitted to process your data in order to fulfil that contract. The same applies when you make use of other services on our website that require your data to be processed. We are also permitted to process your data when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. One example of this is the log data that we collect in order to ensure that our website can be operated without defects, amongst other things. In any case, we will inform you if any relevant processing of your data takes place, and your interests are taken into consideration each time that data is processed as a matter of course. In the event that you have cause for complaint, you can find your rights regarding the processing of your data in the latter section of this Data Protection Information.
The permissions we make use of, and when, are outlined in the following section. You can find more detailed information on how your data is collected, processed and used on our website (i.e. the type, scope and purpose of data processing) in the same section.
Log data
For technical reasons, each time your internet browser accesses our website it automatically sends information to our web server (i.e. log data). We store some of this information in log files, such as:
The date of the access
The time of the access
The URL of the linking website
The files accessed
The volume of data transferred
The browser type and version
The operating system
The IP address (anonymised)
Log data does not contain personal data. As a general rule, we only analyse log data in order to remedy faults in the operation of our website or clarify security incidents. We store this log data indefinitely.
It is sometimes necessary for us to collect additional personal information as well as log data in order to remedy faults or preserve evidence relating to security incidents. In these cases, we are permitted to process the log data by law (article 6(1f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679). We delete this data once the fault has been remedied or the security incident has been clarified in full, or if the original purpose of the processing no longer exists due to other factors. In the event of a security incident, we will transmit log data to the investigating authorities on a case-by-case basis, to the extent permitted.

Cookies, Analytics, Marketing and Tracking
1. Analytics
Analytics refers to the process of collecting, processing, and analysing data to gain insights and make decisions. For us, it's like examining patterns and trends to better understand how our products and services are used by you. This insight allow us to make our products and services more user-friendly. It also enables us to identify areas for improvement and innovation in our products and services. Our websites integrate with analytics platforms (e.g., Adobe Analytics).

As users navigate the website, the analytics code collects data from the cookies/pixels.
