We may transfer information to Citi affiliated companies or other parties throughout the world to process transactions and provide you with products and services. Regardless of where we process your information, we still treat it in accordance with this Notice and applicable law.
IV. AGGREGATION SERVICES
Citi, like many similar companies, offers account aggregation services that allow you to consolidate your electronically enabled financial account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account information in one online location.
When acting as an account aggregator, Citi or its aggregation service provider may request your account user credentials for third-party (non-Citi) financial accounts, including usernames and passwords, in order to access your account information as your agent.
If you provide us access, as your agent, to your third-party account information we may use such information as well as your Citi account information where applicable, to provide you offers, suggestions and insights on your spending, savings and other financial behaviors. These insights are not investment, tax or legal advice and neither Citibank not any of its affiliates are acting as a tax, legal or investment advisor in providing same. With your consent, subject to written agreement, Citigroup Personal Wealth Management or other Citigroup businesses may currently or in the future provide investment advisory or other investment services based on online access to your investment account and other financial information.
You may cancel enrollment in Citi's aggregation service or delete accounts at any time. Upon cancellation or deletion of an account, we will delete and direct our service provider to delete this data from our and their respective records as permitted under applicable law, rules and regulations.
With regard to aggregation services provided by a third-party, if you provide your user credentials or other Personal Information about your Citi accounts to a third-party aggregation services provider, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by such access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action. If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for Citi Online to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to access your account information.
V. ONLINE ADVERTISING
We may, directly or through third parties, serve ads regarding products and services intended to be of interest to you on the Site and on third party sites or apps. We and others may use the online technologies described in the Collection and Use of Information section above to make inferences and predictions about your characteristics, interests and preferences based on your online interests and activities across other sites. We may also use technologies to associate and recognize your various mobile and desktop devices in order to deliver ads and other content in a consistent manner across the devices you use. Information we collect using the technologies described above may also be associated or linked with Personal Information, such as email or postal address, you provided directly to us or others. Alternatively, Personal Information may also be linked with characteristics or attributes about you, such as lifestyle interests, in support of our marketing efforts. If you opt out of interest based advertising, as described in the Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information section below, you will not receive such customized ads on the Site or in other places.

APPENDIX — JURISDICTION SPECIFIC PROVISIONS
I. Supplemental provisions for California residents.
A.
Requests
. California residents have certain rights with respect to Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For purposes of this subsection, the terms consumer, categories of personal information, business purpose, third party, sell, and share have the meanings ascribed to them respectively in the CCPA. Terms defined under the CCPA may differ in meaning from the common usage of the same terms used elsewhere in this Notice.
You have the right to request, up to two times every 12 months, that Citi disclose to you the following: (i) the categories of Personal Information that Citi has collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which Citi has collected Personal Information about you; (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting , selling, or sharing your Personal Information; (iv) the categories of Third Parties to whom the Personal Information was disclosed and (v) the specific pieces of Personal Information that Citi has collected about you. Please note that Personal Information we have collected in connection with your personal account with us is not subject to the requirements of CCPA because it is already protected under existing federal and California state privacy laws, including the Graham Leach Bliley Act.
You have the right to request a portable copy of your Personal Information.
In response to verified requests pursuant to #1 or #2 above, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business days of receipt of the request, and disclose and deliver the required information to you free of charge within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request. We may extend this time period to deliver information once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary. We will provide notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.
You have the right to request that Citi delete Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions allowed under applicable law.
In response to verified requests pursuant to #3 above, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business days of receipt of the request. Following verification of your request, we may require you to separately confirm that you want your Personal Information to be deleted. We will delete the information within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request (subject to certain exceptions). We may extend this time period once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary. We will provide notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.
You have the right to request that Citi correct inaccurate Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions allowed under applicable law. We will accept, review, and consider any documentation that you provide in connection with your right to correct, provided you make a good-faith effort to provide Citi with all relevant information available at the time of the request.
In response to verified requests pursuant to #4 above, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business days of receipt of the request. Following verification of your request, we may require you to provide documentation if necessary to rebut our own documentation that the Personal Information is accurate. If, we determine, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the information is not accurate, we will respond to the request by correcting the information or deleting the information (if deletion of the information does not negatively impact you).We will correct within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request. We may extend this time period once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary. We will provide notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.
NOTICE OF RIGHT TO OPT OUT:
You have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information to, or the sharing of it with, Third Parties by clicking
here
to visit our Privacy Hub. CCPA defines sale very broadly, covering both monetary and other consideration. The same is true of the CCPA's definition of share, except that sharing under the CCPA relates only to the targeting of advertising based on Personal Information from an individual's interaction with other websites and services. Citi does not sell or share Personal Information for money. However, we share some types of Personal Information as further described in Section III of this Notice above.
Citi will not discriminate against you because you elect to exercise these rights, including by:
Denying goods or services to you.
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.
Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
None of the foregoing, however, prohibits Citi from charging you a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to Citi by your data.
B.
Submission of Requests
. You may exercise these rights by managing this information through Citi's Privacy Hub at
online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub
or by calling us at
(833) 971-1191
(TTY: 711). If you wish to submit a request to have your Personal Information deleted or corrected (see sections I.A.3 and I.A.4 in this Appendix), or to opt-out of the selling or sharing of your Personal Information , call us at
(833) 971-1191
(TTY: 711). If you wish to submit any type of CCPA request through an authorized agent, please follow the process in Section I.C. below.
C.
CCPA Authorized Agent.
CCPA permits consumers to designate authorized agents to submit requests on their behalf. Under CCPA, an authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity in California that a consumer has authorized to act on their behalf subject to the requirements. If you would like to designate an authorized agent to submit a request to know, a request to delete, or a request to correct Personal Information on your behalf, please call us at
(833) 971-1191
(TTY: 711).
You or your authorized agent may provide us with a written power of attorney, executed by you, confirming the authority of the authorized agent with respect to your CCPA request(s).
If we have not received a power of attorney, we may require your authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit your CCPA request(s).
In addition, we may also require you to do the following directly with us:
Verify your own identity with us;
Confirm you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the CCPA request(s).
Once verified (see Section I.D. below), your authorized agent may create a unique account for you through Citi's Privacy Hub at
online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub
and manage your requests through that account.
D.
Verification
. Whether you submit a request directly on your own behalf, or through an authorized agent, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your requests under CCPA. Upon receiving a request pursuant to I.A.2, I.A.3 or I.A.4 above, we will confirm receipt within 10 days and provide you with information about how we will verify and process the request. In order to verify your request, we will require you to provide your social security number, tax ID number or passport number and issuing country, in addition to your first and last name, e-mail address and mailing address. We do not require you to verify your identity to make a request pursuant to I.A.5, but we may ask you for information necessary to compete the request. For example, we may ask you for your name, but we will not require you to take a picture of yourself with your driver's license.

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
We train our employees in the proper handling of personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive.
In connection with Citi’s distribution of third-party products, we collect and maintain personal information, including non-public personal information, about you from the following sources:
Information received from you on subscription documents, investor questionnaires and other forms;
Information about your transactions with us and our affiliates;

Professional information (e.g., employer, role or title, business address); and

Whether you are a current or former investor in third-party products, we will not disclose personal information about you except (i) to our employees and affiliates on a need to know basis, which includes personnel who need to know such information for the purposes of complying with applicable anti-money laundering laws and customer identification requirements, and (ii) to sponsors of third-party products, their advisers and service providers, as may be necessary to facilitate or maintain your investments into such third-party products, including as may be required to satisfy any legal, regulatory or compliance requirements of such persons.

As may be required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, as applicable, the purpose of this notice is to inform you of our policies and practices with respect to how we handle, protect and limit the use of nonpublic personal information that we collect and maintain in order to service and administer your business with one or more collective investment vehicles (each, a “Fund,” and your investment therein, an “Interest”) for which Citi Global Alternatives, LLC (“CGA”) serves as investment adviser and certain affiliates of CGA provide distribution and/or other services (collectively, “Citi,” and, as applicable, the managing member of such Fund(s), together with such Fund(s) “we” or “us”). The security of personal information about you is our priority. To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
We train our employees in the proper handling of personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive.
In connection with Citi’s distribution of third-party products, we collect and maintain personal information, including non-public personal information, about you from the following sources:
Information received from you on subscription documents, investor questionnaires and other forms;

Professional information (e.g., employer, role or title, business address); and

We will use such personal information for everyday business purposes, such as to process transactions, maintain accounts, respond to court orders and legal investigations, and otherwise as may be disclosed in the offering materials provided to you and the agreements you enter into in respect of the third-party products offered to you.
Whether you are a current or former investor in third-party products, we will not disclose personal information about you except (i) to our employees and affiliates on a need to know basis, which includes personnel who need to know such information for the purposes of complying with applicable anti-money laundering laws and customer identification requirements, and (ii) to sponsors of third-party products, their advisers and service providers, as may be necessary to facilitate or maintain your investments into such third-party products, including as may be required to satisfy any legal, regulatory or compliance requirements of such persons.

You should carefully review all offering materials with respect to such third-party products and your rights and obligations thereunder.
