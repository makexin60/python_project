targeting360
Cookies are used on our website to enable retargeting advertising campaigns by targeting360 GmbH, Gredinger Str. 24a, 90453 Nuremberg, Germany. The adserving technology of NEORY GmbH, Dortmund, is used for this purpose. For the same purpose, targeting360 GmbH may also load technologies from the providers Adform, Adition, Google or The Trade Desk. These technologies may set additional cookies for this purpose.
The purpose of retargeting is to be able to display interest-based advertising to visitors to our websites on websites of partners in the advertising network.
When you visit our websites and after you have given your consent, the technology used stores a cookie with a unique identifier (cookie ID) in the browser on the end device you are using. If a cookie stored in the browser with this ID is read on a partner site, your device can be recognised. You can then be shown adverts on the partner site that relate, for example, to content that you have previously accessed on our websites.
In order to actually only show you adverts that match your interests, a usage profile is created by analysing the data that is transmitted from your end device to the requested server when you interact with the websites. Your IP address recorded in the process is anonymised by shortening and hashing right at the start of processing. The cookie ID, the approximate location according to the shortened IP address, Internet provider, access speed, technical information on the browser and end device used, operating system, preferred languages according to browser settings, HTTP referrer and date and time of the server request are also used for the usage profile. Your pseudonymised data processed in this way cannot be assigned to you without further ado. Advertising success is also calculated using pseudonymised data without being able to identify a specific person.
The legal basis for the use of the cookies used here and the subsequent processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit a) GDPR. You can terminate the processing of the above-mentioned data based on your consent and the further use of the cookies used for this purpose by exercising your right of revocation or objection under the following link:

Google Tag Manager
Our website uses the Google Tag Manager from the provider Google. Google Tag Manager is a solution with which marketers can manage website tags via an interface. The tool that implements the tags is a cookie-less domain and does not store any personal data. The tool takes care of triggering other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags that are implemented with Google Tag Manager.
Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking
Our website uses Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords). Google Ads is an online advertising programme of the provider Google.
Google Ads enables us to draw attention to our offers with the help of advertising media on external websites and to determine how successful individual advertising measures are. This helps us to show you advertising that is of interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.
Within the framework of Google Ads, we use so-called conversion tracking. The advertising material is delivered by Google via so-called "AdServers". For this purpose, we use so-called AdServer cookies, which can be used to measure certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie is set for conversion tracking. Cookies are small text files that the internet browser stores on the user's computer. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. These cookies enable Google to recognise your web browser. If you visit certain pages of our website when the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognise that you have clicked on the specific advertisement and have been redirected to this page.
Each Google Ads client receives a different cookie. The cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of Ads customers. The following information is usually stored as analysis values for the cookie: unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions), opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wishes to be addressed). The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. The Ads clients learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you can object to this use by easily deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie via your internet browser under user settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based exclusively on your consent, which you can give or revoke at Google (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). In the case of data collection processes that are not merged in your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merging), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that we have an interest in the anonymised analysis of visitors to our website for advertising purposes in order to optimise both our web offering and our advertising.

We will neither sell to third parties nor otherwise market the personal data that you provide to us, e.g. when placing an order or by e-mail (e.g. your name and address or your e-mail address). Your personal data will only be processed for correspondence with you and only for the purpose for which you have provided us with the data. For the processing of payments, we pass on your payment data to the credit institution commissioned with the payment.
The use of data that is automatically collected when you visit our website is only for the purposes stated above. The data will not be used for any other purpose.
We assure you that we will not pass on your personal data to third parties unless we are legally obliged to do so or you have given us your prior consent.
SSL or TLS encryption
Our website uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
Storage period
Personal data that has been communicated to us via our website is only stored until the purpose for which it was entrusted to us has been fulfilled. Insofar as retention periods under commercial and tax law must be observed, the storage period for certain data may be up to 10 years.
Data subjects' rights
With regard to the personal data concerning you, as a data subject, you have the following rights vis-Ã -vis the data controller in accordance with the legal provisions:
Right of withdrawal
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. If the processing of your data is based on your consent, you have the right to revoke your consent to the processing of data at any time with effect for the future in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation. Storage of data for billing and accounting purposes remains unaffected by a revocation.
Right to information
You have the right to request confirmation from us, pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR, as to whether we are processing personal data relating to you. If such processing is taking place, you have the right to obtain information about your personal data processed by us, the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data processed, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your data have been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period or criteria for determining the storage period, the existence of a right of rectification, erasure or access to your personal data. the criteria for determining the storage period, the existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, objection to processing, complaint to a supervisory authority, the origin of your data if it has not been collected from you by us, the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, if applicable, meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing concerning you, as well as your right to be informed about which guarantees exist in accordance with Art. 46 of the GDPR if your data are transferred to third countries.
Right of rectification
In accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, you have the right at any time to demand the immediate correction of any inaccurate personal data relating to you and/or the completion of your incomplete data.
Right to erasure
You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR if one of the following reasons applies:
Your personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
You revoke your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9 (2) a GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
You object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR;
The personal data have been processed unlawfully;
The deletion of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member State to which we are subject;
The personal data was collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8(1) GDPR;
However, this right does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary:
to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law to which we are subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;
for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to Art. 9(2)(h) and (i) and Art. 9(3) GDPR;
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, insofar as the right of the data subject is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing, or
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If we have made your personal data public and we are obliged to erase it in accordance with the above, we shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform data controllers processing the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested that they erase all links to your personal data or copies or replications thereof, taking into account the available technology and the cost of implementation.
Right to restrict processing
You have the right to request the restriction of processing (blocking) of your personal data in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR. To do this, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data has happened / is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balancing of your interests and ours must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
Right to information
If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against us, we are obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. In accordance with Art. 19 of the GDPR, you have the right to be informed about these recipients upon request.
Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, in accordance with Article 22 of the GDPR.
This shall not apply if the decision
is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and us,
is authorised by legislation of the Union or the Member States to which the controller is subject and that legislation contains adequate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, or
is done with your express consent.
However, decisions in the cases referred to in (a) to (c) may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR, unless Article 9(2)(a) or (g) applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
In the cases referred to in (a) and (c), we shall take reasonable steps to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person responsible, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.
Right to data portability
If the processing is based on your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR and is carried out with the help of automated processes, you have the right, pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, to receive your personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format and to transfer it to another controller or to demand that it be transferred to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible.
Right of objection
Insofar as we base the processing of your personal data on the balance of interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on this provision. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this data protection declaration. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data concerned unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims (objection under Article 21(1) of the GDPR).
If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the purpose of direct advertising (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR).
You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.
Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR
In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
The supervisory authority responsible for us is:

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when youâre signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, weâve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users â from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads youâll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When youâre not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
youâre using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When youâre signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you arenât signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information â like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers â for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If youâre using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how youâre using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history youâve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information thatâs saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products youâre using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android deviceâs location on or off
using the deviceâs settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Googleâs Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Googleâs services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services â for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Googleâs first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps youâve already installed and videos youâve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for âmountain bikes,â you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We donât show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We donât show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We donât share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the âtap to callâ button, weâll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, weâll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Googleâs services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
Weâll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isnât covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products â you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.

Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When youâre signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content youâve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When youâre signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
Weâll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. Weâll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators

Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Googleâs audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners â like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, weâll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, weâll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These âserver logsâ typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for âcarsâ looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the userâs ISP. Depending on the userâs service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time theyâve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your deviceâs settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a deviceâs unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If youâre signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your accountâs Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads youâll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for âpizza.â Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that donât reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phoneâs camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it canât be linked to other information about you.
Learn more
benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when youâre signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can
learn more here
. You may also get customized search results even when youâre signed out. If you donât want this level of search customization, you can
search and browse privately
or turn off
signed-out search personalization
.
Customizing our services
For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a âcheck-inâ button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device youâd like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Googleâs Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Googleâs Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesnât follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that itâs taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.
Learn more
.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating youâre not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information thatâs publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Googleâs AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your businessâs information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called âlbcsâ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The âlast account activityâ feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.â We donât use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
youâve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.
synced with your Google Account
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if youâve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.
Learn more
the people who matter most to you online
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you
contact most frequently
.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When youâre signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If youâre a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like âHey Google,â Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

1. About this Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify AB. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.
It applies to your use of:
all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
your use of Spotify on any device
the personalisation of your user experience. Watch
our personalisation explainer video

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.
This Policy is

, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app
Other resources and settings
Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:
Privacy Center
: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data. See
Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'
for more on user rights.
Account Privacy
: Control the processing of certain personal data, including
tailored advertising
.

Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
start a Private session
choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile

2. Your personal data rights and controls
Many privacy laws give rights to individuals over their personal data. These laws include the General Data Protection Regulation, or
'GDPR'
.
Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in
Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'
.
The table below explains:
your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them
You can also watch our video about
Your Privacy Controls

legal basis
of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section âObjectâ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing
There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:
itâs still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotifyâs interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if thereâs an unresolved issue relating to your account
There are several ways you can erase personal data from Spotify:
to remove audio content from your profile select the relevant content and choose to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request erasure of your other personal data from Spotify, follow the steps on our

Tailored advertising controls
What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising.
An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.
How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising on your
Account Privacy
page under 'Tailored Ads'.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode's show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.
If you are 'opted out' of Tailored Ads on your
Account Privacy
page, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
Appropriate age for tailored advertising:
The appropriate age for tailored advertising is determined by the country you are in and what rules apply to tailored advertising in that country. You will not receive Tailored Ads unless you have reached the appropriate age.
You will not be able to 'opt-in' to Tailored Ads if you are under the appropriate age.
You will start to receive Tailored Ads once you reach the appropriate age for your country. When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know. This message will contain a link to the
Account Privacy
page where you can change your preferences or 'opt-out' of Tailored Ads at any time.

6. Data retention
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:
maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes
Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them:
Data retained until you remove it
It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See the section on 'Erasure' in
Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls'
for more information, and the circumstances in which we can act on your request.
You can also delete certain personal data directly from the Spotify Service: for example, you can edit or delete your profile picture. Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses unless one of the limited purposes described below applies.
Data that expires after a specific period of time
We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires after a specific period of time. For example, personal data you may input as part of search queries is generally deleted after 90 days.
Data retained until your Spotify account is deleted
We keep some data until your Spotify account is deleted. Examples of this include your Spotify username and profile information. We also typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy and personalised recommendations that take listening habits into account (for example, Your Time Capsule or Your Summer Rewind). When your Spotify account is deleted, this category of data is deleted or de-identified.
Data retained for extended time periods for limited purposes
After your account is deleted, we keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes. For example, we may be subject to legal or contractual obligations that require this. These may include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data kept for the purposes of litigation. We may also keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This could be:
to help ensure user safety, or
to protect against harmful content on our platform.
This helps us investigate potential breaches of our
User Guidelines
and
Platform Rules
. On the other hand, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.
7. Transfer to other countries
Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.
Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:
make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU
To ensure each data transfer complies with applicable EU legislation, we use the following legal mechanisms:
Standard Contractual Clauses
('
SCCs
'). These clauses require the other party to protect your data and to provide you with EU-level rights and protections. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in
Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you'
to our hosting provider which uses servers in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by
contacting us
or the third party who processes your personal data.
Adequacy Decisions
. This means that we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, we transfer the personal data described in
Section 3 'Personal data we collect about you'
to vendors based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and Switzerland.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation
policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests
8. Keeping your personal data safe
We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.
We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies.
To protect your user account, we encourage you to:
use a strong password which you
only
use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on
protecting your account
You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on
your account page
.
If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device.
It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.
9. Children
Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the
Spotify Kids Privacy Policy
says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.
The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:
is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a
Spotify Kids
account.
If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify,
contact us
.
If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.
10. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
11. How to contact us
For any questions or concerns about this Policy, contact our Data Protection Officer any one of these ways:
email
privacy@spotify.com
write to us at: Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53 Stockholm, Sweden
Spotify AB is the data controller of personal data processed under this Policy.

Privacy Policy

Choose your preferred language
At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights â and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
Thatâs why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as âpersonal data,â no matter where the individual lives.
This means that data that directly identifies you â such as your name â is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you â such as the serial number of your device â is personal data. Aggregated data is considered nonâpersonal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
(collectively, âAppleâ) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Appleâs Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Appleâs behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
for Apple or
shazam.com/privacy
for Shazam.
To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.
There may be situations where we cannot grant your request â for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.
If you live in California and you cannot access Appleâs Data and Privacy page,
you or your authorized agent can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or by calling 1-800-275-2273.
For more information on exercising your rights, visit
support.apple.com/102283
.
At Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to
collect only the personal data that we need
. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
When you create an Apple Account, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:
Account Information.
Your Apple Account and related account details, including email address, devices registered, account status, and age
Device Information.
Data from which your device could be identified, such as device serial number, or about your device, such as browser type
Contact Information
. Data such as name, email address, physical address, phone number, or other contact information
Payment Information. Data about your billing address and method of payment, such as bank details, credit, debit, or other payment card information
Transaction Information.
Data about purchases of Apple products and services or transactions facilitated by Apple, including purchases on Apple platforms
Fraud Prevention Information.
Data used to help identify and prevent fraud, including a device trust score
Usage Data.
Data about your activity on and use of our offerings, such as app launches within our services, including browsing history; search history; product interaction; crash data, performance and other diagnostic data; and other usage data
Location Information
. Precise location only to support services such as Find My or where you agree for region-specific services, and coarse location
Health Information.
Data relating to the health status of an individual, including data related to oneâs physical or mental health or condition. Personal health data also includes data that can be used to make inferences about or detect the health status of an individual. If you participate in a study using an Apple Health Research Study app, the policy governing the privacy of your personal data is described in the
Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy
.
Fitness Information.
Details relating to your fitness and exercise information where you choose to share them
Financial Information.
Details including salary, income, and assets information where collected, and information related to Apple-branded financial offerings
Government ID Data.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government-issued ID in limited circumstances, including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law
Other Information You Provide to Us.
Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels
You are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.
Apple may receive personal data about you from other
individuals
, from businesses or third parties acting
at your direction
, from our
partners
who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other
lawful sources.
Individuals.
Apple may collect data about you from other individuals â for example, if that individual has sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.
At Your Direction.
You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases.
Apple Partners.
We may also validate the information you provide â for example, when creating an Apple Account, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
To power features such as search and as a source for our foundational AI models, Apple uses Applebot, a web crawler, to crawl information that is publicly available on the internet. We have measures in place to reduce the amount of personal data we collect and make no attempt to connect data crawled to any individual Apple user, or to build profiles about individuals. Your private personal data is not used to train our foundational AI models. To exercise your right as an individual to opt out of processing, visit the
Apple Intelligence Privacy Inquiries form
. For more information about Applebot, visit
support.apple.com/120320
.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.
Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or othersâ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Power Our Services.
Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.
Process Your Transactions.
To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.
Communicate with You.
To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.
Security and Fraud Prevention.
To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.
Personal Data Used for Personalization.
If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; itâs also available at all times on your Apple device and online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Comply with Law.
To comply with applicable law â for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental request.
Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
Apple may share personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
,
service providers
who act on our behalf, our
partners
,
developers, and publishers
, or others
at your direction
. Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers.
Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once theyâve fulfilled our request.
Partners.
At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.
If you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others.
Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.
Apple does not sell your personal data including as âsaleâ is defined in Nevada and California. Apple also does not âshareâ your personal data as that term is defined in California.
At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use
administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our
Apple Platform Security
guide.
Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an
individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep childrenâs personal data safe.
To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account. A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent
or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the
childâs educational institution
.
Parents.
To create a child account, parents must review the
Family Privacy Disclosure for Children
, which describes how Apple handles childrenâs personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called âManaged Apple IDs.â These schools are required to agree to the
Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure
which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.
If we learn that a childâs personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.
To exercise privacy rights for your childâs information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
and sign in to their account.
Appleâs websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use
âcookiesâ and other technologies
such as web beacons.
These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
Communications Cookies.
These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Appleâs systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at
apple.com
.
Other Cookies.
These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.
If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and youâre using the Safari web browser, choose âBlock all cookiesâ in Safariâs privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.
In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a âclick-through URLâ that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Appleâs advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app depending on your location. Appleâs advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.
If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.

Apple products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible,
your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world,
including Apple-affiliated companies, to perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of our products and services. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
The Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live.
For example, Apple Store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. and other Apple-affiliated companies on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For example, Imagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps and to support our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc. in California.
Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland. Appleâs international transfer of personal data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by
Standard Contractual Clauses
. If you have questions or would like a copy of Appleâs Standard Contractual Clauses, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
.
Personal data collected by
Apple or an Apple-affiliated company
worldwide is generally stored by Apple Inc. in the United States. Regardless of where your personal data is stored, Apple maintains the same high level of protection and safeguarding measures.
Appleâs privacy practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, comply with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. For more information about the Global CBPR and PRP Systems, visit

Personal data relating to individuals in the Peopleâs Republic of China may be processed by Apple in countries outside of the Peopleâs Republic of China, such as Apple Inc. in the United States or Apple Distribution International Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law. For the purposes of processing set out in this Privacy Policy, Apple may also transfer such personal data to third-party service providers, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of the Peopleâs Republic of China.

For the purpose of this Global Privacy Notice, unless otherwise specified, âPersonal Informationâ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. We may obtain different types of Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information, as may be the case under applicable laws) relating to you in the situations described below.
Personal Information We Receive from Financial Institutions, Merchants, and Other Partners in Connection with Mastercardâs Products or Services
As a processor of payment transactions and provider of related services, we obtain a limited amount of information in connection with your payment transactions such as the personal account number, the merchantâs name and location, the date and the total amount of the transaction. Importantly, we generally do not need or collect the cardholderâs name or other contact information to process payment transactions.
In addition, for certain products and services, your financial institutions, the merchants where you make a transaction or other partners may provide us with more information about you, or we may collect it directly from you to provide you with those products and services on their behalf, support their business or perform processing activities on their behalf.
In the above situations, we may act on behalf of and under the instructions of financial institutions, merchants and other partners which act as data controllers. Unless otherwise authorized by law, we will process your Personal Information to process payment transactions or for the purposes agreed between Mastercard and the financial institutions, merchants and other partners. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information regarding the processing of your Personal Information.
Personal Information We Collect when Providing Mastercardâs Products and Services Directly to You
Mastercard may provide you directly with products and services such as marketing programs, rewards programs, eWallets, Open Banking solutions, prepaid services, location alert programs, and biometric authentication tools. To benefit from one or more of these products and services, you can submit information to us directly via various means including: (i) on our websites and digital assets, (ii) in response to marketing or other communications, (iii) by signing up for a Mastercard product or service, or (iv) through your participation in an offer, program or promotion. We may also obtain Personal Information about you through your use of our products or services, from companies that use or facilitate our products or services, from publicly available sources, or from third party partners. Your Personal Information may also be passed on to us by your financial institution, merchant or other business partners.
Below is an overview of the types of Personal Information we may collect in relation to programs we offer directly to you. Each program differs, so where applicable, please refer to the relevant program-specific privacy notice for more information on the use of your Personal Information for that specific program.
Registration and payment information: We may collect identifiers and your contact information (such as name, email address, telephone number, billing or shipping address), authentication information (e.g., username and password), age, date of birth, gender and family status, military and veteran status, language preferences, payment details, personal account number, commercial information, such as merchantâs name and location, date and total amount of the transactions, card expiration date and card verification code.
Information we process to provide you with the program: We may collect different types of Personal Information depending on the program. For example, programs designed to offer you location-based services will typically require the collection of your address or geolocation data. Programs within our Open Banking solutions may require the collection of your financial account information. Similarly, programs designed to allow you to authenticate for example, via facial or fingerprint recognition may require the processing of your photograph and/or biometric information. All these programs are voluntary, and your Personal Information is only collected if you subscribe to such programs.
Other information you choose to provide: You may choose to provide other information, such as different types of content (e.g., photographs, articles, comments), contact information of friends or other people you would like us to contact, content you make available through social media accounts or memberships with third parties, or any other information you want to share with us, for example when you contact customer service.
You may be subject to obligations under applicable laws, such as the obligation to provide complete and accurate Personal Information when consenting to the processing of your Personal Information.
In addition, we may collect or use Personal Information for fraud prevention and monitoring, risk management, dispute resolution and other related purposes. Such information may include identifiers, commercial information, and Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as the personal account number, merchantâs name and location, date and total amount of the transactions, IP address, fraud score, location data, merchant details, items purchased and information about the dispute.

When you visit a website that contains such tools or plugins, the social media or other service provider may learn of your visit. However, your interactions with these tools are governed by the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platforms. As we do not control these third-partiesâ data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).

6. Unter welchen UmstÃ¤nden geben wir personenbezogene Daten weiter
Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte weiter, wenn eine Rechtsgrundlage dafÃ¼r besteht.
Dies umfasst:
Andere PayPal-Unternehmen
, um Ihnen die Dienste bereitzustellen, sowie in unserem berechtigten Interesse an der AusÃ¼bung unserer GeschÃ¤ftstÃ¤tigkeit. Diese Interessen werden in Abschnitt 5 (
Welche personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden und auf welchen Rechtsgrundlagen dies beruht
)
nÃ¤her erlÃ¤utert. Das PayPal-Unternehmen, das Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhÃ¤lt, verarbeitet diese in Einklang mit dieser DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung.
BehÃ¶rden
, soweit wir rechtlich dazu verpflichtet sind. Dazu zÃ¤hlen SteuerbehÃ¶rden, PolizeibehÃ¶rden, StrafverfolgungsbehÃ¶rden und AufsichtsbehÃ¶rden in den jeweils maÃgeblichen LÃ¤ndern. Wir kÃ¶nnen auch verpflichtet sein, zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden, wie beispielsweise den FinanzbehÃ¶rden, Informationen Ã¼ber Ihre Nutzung unserer Dienste zur VerfÃ¼gung zu stellen. Dies kann Ihren Namen, Ihre Adresse und Informationen zu Kartentransaktionen umfassen, die wir in Ihrem Auftrag Ã¼ber unsere Dienste abwickeln. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r die Einhaltung von Offenlegungspflichten, die sich aus dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten ergeben, ist die bestehende rechtliche Verpflichtung. Soweit die Offenlegung nicht auf dem Recht der EU und der Mitgliedstaaten beruht, ist die Rechtsgrundlage unser berechtigtes Interesse und die Einhaltung geltender Vorschriften zur Verhinderung widerrechtlichen Verhaltens.
Andere Finanzinstitute und Kartennetzwerke
, um die Zahlungsabwicklung zu erleichtern, gemeinsam ein Produkt anzubieten oder Karten Ihrer E-BÃ¶rse hinzuzufÃ¼gen. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r die Offenlegung ist die ErfÃ¼llung des zwischen Ihnen und uns bestehenden Vertrags. Die betreffenden Parteien kÃ¶nnen auch fÃ¼r andere berechtigte Zwecke auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zugreifen, wie etwa IdentitÃ¤tsprÃ¼fung, BetrugsprÃ¤vention und Risikomanagement. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrÃ¼gerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
BetrugsbekÃ¤mpfungs- und IdentitÃ¤tsprÃ¼fungsbehÃ¶rden
, zum Beispiel, um uns bei der Erkennung von AktivitÃ¤ten zu unterstÃ¼tzen, die auf Betrug hindeuten. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r diese Verarbeitung ist das berechtigte Interesse von uns und unseren Partnern, betrÃ¼gerisches und rechtswidriges Verhalten zu verhindern.
InkassobÃ¼ros
, beispielsweise um unbezahlte Ã¼berfÃ¤llige Forderungen durch Dritte wie ein InkassobÃ¼ro einzuziehen. Wir tun dies auf der Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses, GeschÃ¤fte zu tÃ¤tigen und Schulden einzutreiben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung dieser Parteien fÃ¼r die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten gilt, die Sie ihnen direkt mitteilen, und dass sie Ihre unbezahlten Schulden Kreditauskunfteien melden kÃ¶nnen, was Ihre KreditwÃ¼rdigkeit oder Ihre FÃ¤higkeit zur Sicherung zukÃ¼nftiger Kredite beeintrÃ¤chtigen kann.
Dienstanbieter
, die in unserem Auftrag und nach unseren Weisungen Dienstleistungen erbringen, die wir an sie ausgelagert haben, wie z.B. Marketing, IT-Entwicklung, Wartung, Hosting und Support sowie Kundenserviceleistungen. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r diese Verarbeitung ist die ErfÃ¼llung unserer gegenÃ¼ber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten.
Andere Nutzer, soweit dies ausweislich Ihrer Kontoeinstellungen zulÃ¤ssig ist
. Ãber Ihre Kontoeinstellungen kÃ¶nnen Sie anderen Nutzern bestimmte Informationen wie Ihr Profilfoto, Ihren Vor- und Nachnamen, Ihren Benutzernamen oder Ihren Wohnort anzeigen oder zugÃ¤nglich machen. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r diese Verarbeitung ist Ihre Einwilligung. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie Ihre Profileinstellungen jederzeit und kostenfrei Ã¤ndern kÃ¶nnen.
Finanzinstitute in Verbindung mit Ihrer Teilnahme an Open Banking
, z.B. wenn Sie eine Kontoverbindung mit einer anderen Bank, einem Kartenkonto oder einem Aggregator einleiten. Wir prÃ¼fen daher, ob Sie Ã¼ber genÃ¼gend Geld verfÃ¼gen, oder bestÃ¤tigen, dass Sie der Inhaber des Kontos sind. Wenn Sie Ihr Konto verknÃ¼pfen, ist die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r den Zugriff auf Ihre Kontodaten die ErfÃ¼llung unserer vertraglichen Verpflichtungen gegenÃ¼ber Ihnen.
Partner und HÃ¤ndler, deren Dienstanbieter und sonstige Transaktionsbeteiligte
. Wenn Sie beispielsweise die Dienste nutzen, um Online-EinkÃ¤ufe zu tÃ¤tigen, Zahlungen an andere Nutzer vorzunehmen oder Waren zurÃ¼ckzugeben, kÃ¶nnen wir Informationen Ã¼ber Sie und Ihr Konto an die anderen Parteien weitergeben, die an der Abwicklung Ihrer Transaktionen beteiligt sind. Die Rechtsgrundlage fÃ¼r diese Verarbeitung ist die ErfÃ¼llung unserer gegenÃ¼ber Ihnen bestehenden Vertragspflichten sowie unser berechtigtes Interesse. Bitte beachten Sie, dass fÃ¼r personenbezogene Daten, die an Partner und HÃ¤ndler (oder deren Dienstanbieter) weitergegeben werden, welche an einer Transaktion beteiligt sind, die eigenen DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungen und Verfahren der Partner und HÃ¤ndler gelten.
Externe, unabhÃ¤ngige Datenverantwortliche
, wenn wir beispielsweise personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien, Erwerber und andere Finanzinstitute weitergeben oder an Sicherheitsprodukte, um zu verhindern, dass Bots auf unsere Dienste zugreifen kÃ¶nnen.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass fÃ¼r die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie direkt an diese Parteien weitergeben, deren DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungen gelten
. So verwenden wir beispielsweise reCAPTCHA von Google, um Missbrauch unserer Dienste zu verhindern, wenn Sie auf unsere PayPal-App zugreifen. Die
DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung
und die
Nutzungsbedingungen
von Google gelten fÃ¼r die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie an Google weitergeben. Weitere Informationen zu Kreditauskunfteien, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten, um Ihre KreditwÃ¼rdigkeit zu bewerten, finden Sie in Abschnitt 12 (
Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
).
KÃ¤ufer oder sonstige Weitergabe in Verbindung mit einer GeschÃ¤ftsÃ¼bertragung
. Wenn wir beispielsweise ein GeschÃ¤ft oder VermÃ¶genswerte verÃ¤uÃern, kÃ¶nnen wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an einen KÃ¤ufer dieses GeschÃ¤fts oder dieser VermÃ¶genswerte weitergeben. Ebenso kÃ¶nnen personenbezogene Daten weitergegeben werden, wenn PayPal oder ein wesentlicher Teil des PayPal-VermÃ¶gens von einer dritten Partei erworben wird. PayPal hat ein berechtigtes Interesse daran, derartige Transaktionen durchfÃ¼hren zu kÃ¶nnen.
7. Wie lange Ihre personenbezogenen Daten von PayPal gespeichert werden
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange, wie es im Rahmen des Zwecks, fÃ¼r den sie erhoben wurden, und in Ãbereinstimmung mit dem geltenden Recht benÃ¶tigt oder zulÃ¤ssig ist.
Die Kriterien fÃ¼r die Bestimmung der Aufbewahrungsfrist lauten:
Personenbezogene Daten, die fÃ¼r die laufende Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und PayPal genutzt werden, werden fÃ¼r die Dauer der Beziehung zuzÃ¼glich eines Zeitraums von zehn Jahren gespeichert
Personenbezogene Daten in Bezug auf eine rechtliche Verpflichtung, der wir unterliegen, werden im Einklang mit geltendem Recht aufbewahrt, wie z.B. gemÃ¤Ã geltendem Insolvenzrecht und AML-Verpflichtungen.
Wir speichern personenbezogene Daten so lange wie nÃ¶tig, wenn die Aufbewahrung angesichts von Rechtsstreitigkeiten, Ermittlungen, Audit- und Compliance-Praktiken oder zum Schutz vor RechtsansprÃ¼chen ratsam ist.
8. Internationale Ãbermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten
Da wir in zahlreichen LÃ¤ndern tÃ¤tig sind, kann es vorkommen, dass wir (oder unsere Dienstanbieter) Ihre Daten auÃerhalb des Landes, in dem Sie leben, Ã¼bermitteln und verarbeiten. Um Ihre Daten in den Vereinigten Staaten und anderen LÃ¤ndern zu verarbeiten und zu speichern, setzen wir externe Dienstanbieter ein. In den betreffenden LÃ¤ndern ist nicht immer ein gleichwertiger Datenschutz gegeben. Wir haben daher konkrete MaÃnahmen in Ãbereinstimmung mit dem Datenschutzrecht der EU und GroÃbritanniens getroffen, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu schÃ¼tzen. Bei der Ãbermittlung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zwischen PayPal-Unternehmen stÃ¼tzen wir uns auf von den zustÃ¤ndigen AufsichtsbehÃ¶rden genehmigte bindende Unternehmensregeln (abrufbar
hier
). Andere Ãbermittlungen erfolgen auf der Grundlage von Standardvertragsklauseln, die von der EuropÃ¤ischen Kommission genehmigt wurden, damit gewÃ¤hrleistet ist, dass Ihre Daten einen hohen Schutzstandard genieÃen und Ihre Datenschutzrechte gewahrt bleiben.

kontaktieren
. Wir werden dann Ã¼berprÃ¼fen, ob das Verfahren korrekt durchgefÃ¼hrt wurde.
Sie haben das Recht, einer automatisierten Entscheidung zu widersprechen, wenn deren Rechtsfolgen oder Ergebnisse geeignet sind, (zusammen mit dem entsprechenden Profiling) in sonstiger Weise erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Sie zu haben, indem Sie uns
kontaktieren
. Wir prÃ¼fen die Entscheidung sodann unter BerÃ¼cksichtigung der zusÃ¤tzlichen UmstÃ¤nde.
Zustimmung
Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten mit Ihrer Zustimmung verwenden, haben Sie im Allgemeinen das Recht, Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zu widerrufen, ohne die RechtmÃ¤Ãigkeit der Verarbeitung aufgrund der Zustimmung vor ihrem Widerruf zu beeintrÃ¤chtigen.
Die RechtmÃ¤Ãigkeit einer Verarbeitung, die vor Ihrem Widerruf stattgefunden hat, wird durch den Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung nicht berÃ¼hrt. Das gleiche gilt fÃ¼r die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten auf der Grundlage eines anderen Rechtsgrundes als Ihrer Einwilligung.
Widerspruchsrecht gegen Direktmarketing
Sofern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten fÃ¼r Direktmarketingzwecke verwenden, kÃ¶nnen Sie jederzeit Ihre Berechtigungseinstellungen Ã¤ndern, widersprechen und sich Ã¼ber den Abmeldelink in elektronischen Mitteilungen bzw. Ã¼ber Ihre Kontoeinstellungen von zukÃ¼nftigen Direktmarketingnachrichten abmelden.
Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verarbeitung berechtigter Interessen
Verwenden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfolgung berechtigter Interessen von uns oder einem Dritten, haben Sie das Recht, der Verwendung fÃ¼r diesen Zweck zu widersprechen. NÃ¤heres dazu finden Sie in Abschnitt 5 (

11. NÃ¤here Informationen zu automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung und Profiling
"
Automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung
" ist der Prozess der vollautomatischen Entscheidungsfindung ohne menschliche Beteiligung. In einigen FÃ¤llen kÃ¶nnten diese Entscheidungen
rechtliche oder Ã¤hnlich erhebliche Auswirkungen
auf Sie als natÃ¼rliche Person haben. "
Profiling
" bezeichnet Analysen der PersÃ¶nlichkeit, des Verhaltens, des Interesses und der Gewohnheiten einer Person, um Vorhersagen oder Entscheidungen Ã¼ber sie zu treffen. Soweit dies nach dem Recht der EU oder der Mitgliedstaaten zulÃ¤ssig oder fÃ¼r den Abschluss oder die ErfÃ¼llung eines Vertrags erforderlich ist, kÃ¶nnen wir in einigen FÃ¤llen automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling fÃ¼r Entscheidungen verwenden. Ein Beispiel fÃ¼r unseren Einsatz automatisierter Entscheidungsfindung ist die Bewertung Ihrer KreditwÃ¼rdigkeit, um Ihre Eignung fÃ¼r bestimmte Kreditprodukte zu beurteilen.
Wir glauben, dass PayPal durch das automatische Treffen solcher Entscheidungen seine ObjektivitÃ¤t und Transparenz bei der Entscheidung, welche Dienste Ihnen angeboten werden, erhÃ¶ht. Wir setzen mehrere Sicherheitsmechanismen ein, um sicherzustellen, dass die Entscheidungen angemessen sind. Zu diesen Mechanismen gehÃ¶ren laufende Ãbersichten unserer Entscheidungsmodelle und Stichproben im Einzelfall. Sie kÃ¶nnen stattdessen jederzeit eine manuelle Entscheidungsfindung verlangen, Ihre Meinung Ã¤uÃern oder eine Entscheidungsfindung anfechten, die ausschlieÃlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung, einschlieÃlich Profiling, beruht, wenn eine solche Entscheidung
rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder Sie in Ã¤hnlicher Weise erheblich beeintrÃ¤chtigt
. Weitere Informationen darÃ¼ber, wie Sie diesen Entscheidungen widersprechen kÃ¶nnen, finden Sie in Abschnitt 10
("Ihre Datenschutzrechte")
.

12. Warum wir personenbezogene Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben
Haben Sie einen Kredit beantragt oder nutzen Sie unsere Kreditdienste, kÃ¶nnen wir zur Bearbeitung Ihres Antrags Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Kreditauskunfteien weitergeben, die uns Informationen Ã¼ber Sie geben, wie z.B. Ihre Finanzhistorie. Dies geschieht, um KreditwÃ¼rdigkeit und Produkteignung zu beurteilen, Ihre IdentitÃ¤t zu Ã¼berprÃ¼fen, offene Forderungen zu ermitteln und einzuziehen sowie kriminelle Handlungen zu verhindern.
Die Rechtsgrundlagen fÃ¼r diese Ãbermittlungen finden sich in Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b (vertraglich) und Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstabe f (berechtigtes Interesse) der EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung ("EU-DSGVO").
Wir werden auch weiterhin laufend Informationen Ã¼ber Sie mit Kreditauskunfteien austauschen, einschlieÃlich Ã¼ber Ihre beglichenen Konten und alle Schulden, die nicht rechtzeitig vollstÃ¤ndig zurÃ¼ckgezahlt wurden. Diese Informationen kÃ¶nnen von CRAs an andere Organisationen weitergegeben werden, um Ã¤hnliche ÃberprÃ¼fungen durchzufÃ¼hren und Ihren Aufenthaltsort zu ermitteln und Schulden einzutreiben.
Ihre Daten werden auch mit den Daten aller gemeinsamen Bewerber oder anderer Finanzpartner verknÃ¼pft.

Sie kÃ¶nnen sich an die Kreditauskunfteien, die im Land Ihres Wohnsitzes tÃ¤tig sind, direkt wenden, wenn Sie Fragen zu deren Dienstleistungen, Ihrem Kreditscore oder zu den Ã¼ber Sie gespeicherten Daten haben. Das gleiche gilt, wenn Sie gegenÃ¼ber den Kreditauskunfteien Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person ausÃ¼ben mÃ¶chten.
13. Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten schÃ¼tzen
Wir fÃ¼hren technische, physische und administrative SicherheitsmaÃnahmen durch, um Ihre personenbezogenen Daten angemessen vor Verlust, Missbrauch, unbefugtem Zugriff, Weitergabe und Ãnderung zu schÃ¼tzen. Zu diesen SicherheitsmaÃnahmen gehÃ¶ren Firewalls, DatenverschlÃ¼sselung, physische ZugangsbeschrÃ¤nkungen fÃ¼r unsere Rechenzentren und Berechtigungskontrollen fÃ¼r den Zugriff auf Daten. Wir sorgen fÃ¼r die Sicherung unserer Systeme und Dienste. FÃ¼r die Sicherheit und die Geheimhaltung Ihres Passworts bzw. Ihrer PasswÃ¶rter und Ihres Kontoprofils bzw. Ihrer Anmeldedaten sind Sie jedoch selbst verantwortlich. DarÃ¼ber hinaus liegt es in Ihrer Verantwortung zu prÃ¼fen, dass die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir Ã¼ber Sie besitzen, richtig und auf dem aktuellen Stand sind.

16. Hinweis zu Bankvorschriften fÃ¼r Nutzer im EWR und in GroÃbritannien
In der Regel verlangt das luxemburgische Recht, dem PayPal (in Bezug auf Datenschutz und Bankgeheimnis) unterliegt, einen hÃ¶heren Grad an Transparenz als die meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen in der EU. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Anbietern von Internet- oder Finanzdienstleistungen in der EU listen wir daher in dieser DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung die Drittanbieter und GeschÃ¤ftspartner, die Dienstleistungen fÃ¼r uns erbringen und denen gegenÃ¼ber wir Ihre Daten offenlegen, sowie den Zweck der Offenlegung und die Art der offengelegten Daten auf. Einen Link zu diesen Drittanbietern finden Sie
hier
. Dadurch, dass Sie diese DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung annehmen und ein Konto bei PayPal haben, willigen Sie ausdrÃ¼cklich in die Ãbermittlung Ihrer Daten an diese Drittanbieter fÃ¼r die aufgefÃ¼hrten Zwecke ein.
PayPal kann die oben genannte Drittanbieterliste am ersten Werktag eines jeden Quartals (d.h. im Januar, April, Juli und Oktober) aktualisieren. PayPal beginnt erst 30 Tage nach dem Datum der VerÃ¶ffentlichung der Liste innerhalb der DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung mit der Ãbermittlung von Daten an eines der in der jeweiligen Aktualisierung neu aufgefÃ¼hrten Unternehmen oder fÃ¼r die dort neu aufgefÃ¼hrten Zwecke oder Datentypen. Sie sollten sich in jedem Quartal zu den oben genannten Terminen auf der PayPal-Website erneut mit der Liste vertraut machen. Wenn Sie der neuen Form der DatenÃ¼bertragung nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach VerÃ¶ffentlichung der aktualisierten Drittanbieterliste widersprechen, gelten die Ãnderungen der Liste und dieser DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung als von Ihnen angenommen. Sind Sie mit den Ãnderungen nicht einverstanden, steht es Ihnen frei, Ihr Konto zu schlieÃen und unsere Dienste nicht mehr zu nutzen.
Um die PayPal-Dienste bereitstellen zu kÃ¶nnen, mÃ¼ssen wir mÃ¶glicherweise bestimmte Daten, die wir (wie in dieser DatenschutzerklÃ¤rung dargelegt) erhoben haben, an andere mit PayPal verbundene Unternehmen oder sonstige Stellen Ã¼bermitteln, einschlieÃlich solcher, die gemÃ¤Ã diesem Abschnitt eine Funktion als Zahlungsdienstleister, Zahlungsanbieter oder Kontoinhaber (oder Ã¤hnliche Funktionen) erfÃ¼llen. Sie erkennen an, dass diese Stellen in ihren jeweiligen Rechtsordnungen Gesetzen, Vorschriften, Untersuchungen, Ermittlungen oder Anordnungen unterworfen sein kÃ¶nnen, durch die sie zur Weitergabe von Daten an die zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden des betreffenden Landes verpflichtet sind. Durch die Nutzung der PayPal-Dienste willigen Sie in die Ãbermittlung solcher Daten durch uns zum Zweck der Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie ein.
Insbesondere stimmen Sie allen folgenden DatenverarbeitungsmaÃnahmen zu und weisen PayPal an, diese vorzunehmen:
a. Offenlegung notwendiger Informationen gegenÃ¼ber der Polizei und anderen StrafverfolgungsbehÃ¶rden, SicherheitskrÃ¤ften, zustÃ¤ndigen staatlichen, zwischenstaatlichen oder Ã¼berstaatlichen Stellen, zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden, Abteilungen, AufsichtsbehÃ¶rden, SelbstregulierungsbehÃ¶rden oder -organisationen (einschlieÃlich der
hier
im Abschnitt "BehÃ¶rden" der Drittanbieterliste genannten Stellen) und anderen Dritten, einschlieÃlich Unternehmen der PayPal-Gruppe, (i) deren Weisungen wir gesetzlich verpflichtet und befugt sind, einzuhalten, unter anderem aufgrund der luxemburgischen Gesetze vom 24. Juli 2015 Ã¼ber das US-amerikanische Gesetz zur Einhaltung der Steuervorschriften fÃ¼r Auslandskonten ("FATCA-Gesetz") und vom 18. Dezember 2015 Ã¼ber die einvernehmlich festgelegten Standards fÃ¼r die Berichterstattung der OECD ("CRS-Gesetz"), (ii) bei denen wir Grund zu der Annahme haben, dass die Kooperation mit ihnen bei der Untersuchung von BetrugsfÃ¤llen oder sonstigen tatsÃ¤chlichen oder mutmaÃlichen widerrechtlichen AktivitÃ¤ten geboten ist, oder (iii) zur Ermittlung von VerstÃ¶Ãen gegen unsere Nutzungsbedingungen (dies gilt auch fÃ¼r Ihre Zahlungsquelle oder Ihren Kredit- oder Debitkartenanbieter).
Wenn Sie in den Geltungsbereich des FATCA- oder des CRS-Gesetzes fallen, sind wir dazu verpflichtet, Sie Ã¼ber die Weitergabe von Daten an die jeweiligen BehÃ¶rden zu unterrichten. Informieren Sie sich Ã¼ber die Verpflichtungen von PayPal nach dem FATCA- und dem CRS-Gesetz sowie darÃ¼ber, welche Auswirkungen diese Verpflichtungen fÃ¼r Sie haben kÃ¶nnen und welche Informationen wir gegebenenfalls im Zuge dieser Verpflichtungen weitergeben.
Wir und weitere Organisationen, einschlieÃlich von Unternehmen, die Zahlungen Ã¼ber PayPal akzeptieren, kÃ¶nnen notwendige Daten (darunter auch Daten, die von BetrugsbekÃ¤mpfungsstellen aufgezeichnet wurden, und Daten aus anderen LÃ¤ndern) zum Zwecke der Bewertung und Verwaltung von Risiken (wie z.B. zur Verhinderung von Betrug, GeldwÃ¤sche und Terrorismusfinanzierung) weitergeben, nutzen und auf sie zugreifen. Bitte wenden Sie sich an uns, wenn Sie weitere Informationen Ã¼ber die jeweiligen BetrugsbekÃ¤mpfungsstellen wÃ¼nschen. Klicken Sie
hier
, um weitere Informationen zu diesen BehÃ¶rden, den BetrugsbekÃ¤mpfungsstellen und sonstigen Dritten zu erhalten.
b. Offenlegung von Kontoinformationen gegenÃ¼ber Inhabern von geistigem Eigentum, wenn diese nach dem maÃgeblichen nationalen Recht eines EU-Mitgliedstaates einen auÃergerichtlichen Auskunftsanspruch gegen PayPal aufgrund einer Verletzung ihrer geistigen Eigentumsrechte haben, bei der PayPal-Dienste genutzt wurden (zum Beispiel Â§ 19, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Markengesetzes oder Â§ 101, Absatz 2, Unterabsatz 3 des deutschen Urheberrechtsgesetzes).
c. Obligatorische Offenlegung aufgrund von Kreditkartenbestimmungen oder in straf- oder zivilrechtlichen Verfahren.
d. Offenlegung Ihres Namens und PayPal-Links im PayPal-Benutzerverzeichnis. Ihre Daten werden anderen PayPal-Kunden angezeigt, wenn diese eine Suche anhand Ihres Namens, Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer oder eines Teils dieser Angaben durchfÃ¼hren. Dadurch soll sichergestellt werden, dass Zahlungen an den richtigen EmpfÃ¤nger erfolgen. Diese Funktion kann in den PayPal-Profileinstellungen deaktiviert werden.
e. Nutzen Sie als HÃ¤ndler einen Dritten fÃ¼r den Zugriff auf PayPal oder die Integration von PayPal, kÃ¶nnen wir notwendige Informationen an diesen Dritten zur Umsetzung und Verwaltung der betreffenden Vereinbarungen weitergeben (darunter den Status Ihrer PayPal-Integration, ob Sie ein aktives PayPal-Konto haben und ob Sie bereits mit einem anderen PayPal-Integrationspartner arbeiten).
f. Offenlegung notwendiger Daten gegenÃ¼ber Zahlungsanbietern, WirtschaftsprÃ¼fern, Kundenservice-Anbietern, Kreditauskunfteien und BetrugsbekÃ¤mpfungsstellen, Anbietern von Finanzprodukten, Handelspartnern, Marketing- und PR-Unternehmen, Anbietern von operativen Dienstleistungen, Konzerngesellschaften, Agenturen, MarktplÃ¤tzen und sonstigen Dritten, die
hier
aufgefÃ¼hrt sind. Zweck der Offenlegung ist die Bereitstellung der PayPal-Dienste an Sie. In der Drittanbieterliste haben wir auÃerdem unter jeder Kategorie nicht abschlieÃende Beispiele von Drittanbietern (einschlieÃlich deren AbtretungsempfÃ¤ngern und Rechtsnachfolgern) aufgefÃ¼hrt, gegenÃ¼ber denen eine Offenlegung Ihrer Kontoinformationen derzeit tatsÃ¤chlich stattfindet oder in Betracht gezogen werden kann. Neben dem Zweck der Offenlegung haben wir auch die offengelegten Informationen angegeben (soweit nicht anders angegeben, ist es diesen Drittanbietern gesetzlich bzw. vertraglich untersagt, die Informationen fÃ¼r einen anderen als den vorgesehenen Zweck zu nutzen).
g. Offenlegung erforderlicher Daten gegenÃ¼ber Ihren Vertretern bzw. VerfahrensbevollmÃ¤chtigten (z.B. dem Inhaber einer von Ihnen erteilten Vollmacht oder einem fÃ¼r Sie bestellten Vormund).
h. Offenlegung von zusammengefassten Statistikdaten an unsere GeschÃ¤ftspartner oder PR-Partner. Wir kÃ¶nnen beispielsweise offenlegen, dass ein bestimmter Prozentsatz unserer Kunden in einer bestimmten Stadt lebt. Diese zusammengefassten Daten enthalten keine personenbezogenen Daten.
i. Weitergabe notwendiger Kontoinformationen an nicht mit uns verbundene (
hier
aufgefÃ¼hrte) Drittanbieter zu folgenden Zwecken:
BetrugsprÃ¤vention und Risikosteuerung: PrÃ¤vention von Betrug sowie Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken.
Kundenservice: zu Zwecken des Kundenservice, einschlieÃlich der Betreuung Ihrer Konten oder zur KlÃ¤rung von Konflikten (z.B. in Bezug auf Rechnungen oder Transaktionen).

Einhaltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften: zur UnterstÃ¼tzung der Verifizierungsanforderungen bei der BekÃ¤mpfung von GeldwÃ¤sche und Terrorismusfinanzierung.
Dienstleister: um die mit uns vertraglich verbundenen Dienstleister in die Lage zu versetzen, uns bei geschÃ¤ftlichen VorgÃ¤ngen wie z.B. BetrugsprÃ¤vention, InkassomaÃnahmen, Marketing, Kundenservice und Technologiedienstleistungen zu unterstÃ¼tzen. Diese Dienstleister werden von uns vertraglich verpflichtet, Ihre Daten nur fÃ¼r die Dienstleistungen zu verwenden, die sie fÃ¼r uns erbringen, nicht jedoch zu ihrem eigenen Nutzen.
