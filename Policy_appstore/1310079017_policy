Privacy Policy
We‚Äôll describe below the agreement in which Legit Check By Ch (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù ) and its users are in regards to their privacy.
Identity & access
When you sign up for the Legit Check By Ch products (‚ÄúService‚Äù, ‚ÄúServices‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegit Check By Ch Authentication Service‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegit Check App By Ch‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegit Check By Ch Organizer‚Äù, ‚ÄúLegit Check By Ch Library‚Äù), we can ask for your name, email address, billing address, location and information about your items. That‚Äôs just so:
You can personalize your account
You can send us relevant data about your item(s)
We can let our third parties check whether there‚Äôs a connection between your billing address and your card information
We can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information.
When you pay for the Legit Check By Ch products, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That‚Äôs so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn‚Äôt ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and to print on your invoices.
When you write our company with a question or to ask for help, we‚Äôll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages, we‚Äôll track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.
The only times we‚Äôll ever share your info:
To provide products or services you‚Äôve requested, with your permission.
To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our
Terms of Service
, or as otherwise required by law.
If Legit Check By Ch is acquired by or merged with another company, we‚Äôll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Your Rights With Respect to Your Information
GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, Legit Check By Ch recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR include:
Right of Access.
This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
Right to Correction.
This is your right to request correction of your personal information.
Right to Erasure.
This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the ‚ÄúRight to be forgotten‚Äù). However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using Legit Check By Ch Services and may result in closing your account.
Right to Complain.
You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
Right to Restrict Processing.
This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.

Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.
This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.
Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.
When we access or share your information
The only times we‚Äôll ever access or share your info are:
To provide products or services you‚Äôve requested
. We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data.
To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.
If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.
To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential abusive cases.
Accessing a customer‚Äôs account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
When required under applicable law.
If the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we‚Äôre legally prevented from it, we‚Äôll always inform you when such requests are made.
Processors we use
As part of the services we provide, and only to the extent necessary, we may use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal information. We have signed appropriate data processing contracts that comply with GDPR with each processor.
Law enforcement
