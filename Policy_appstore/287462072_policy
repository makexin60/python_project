How To Contact Us
Information We Obtain
We obtain personal information about customers through our Services, publicly and commercially available
        sources, and from some third-party services (such as social media networks). The types of personal
        information we may obtain include:
Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);
Username and password when you register through our Services;
Geolocation data;
Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” or “Contact Us” feature; and
Behavioral data such as website pages visited or time spent using our Services.
Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services
We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies
        (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar
        technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services.
        The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser
        characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
        information on actions taken on our Services, and dates and times you access or use our Services. In
        connection with our mobile apps, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to
        uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon”
        also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies
        and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these
        automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other
        content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website,
        a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and
        store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.
We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device
        information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you
        have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may
        have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be
        notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of
        cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of
        our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple
        and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with us through our apps or
        other app developers.
In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social
        media network (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from
        the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social
        media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends
        lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social
        media network.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media
        sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with
        these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject
        to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. Our Company is not responsible for those providers’
        information practices.
How We Use the Information We Obtain
We may use the information collected from and about you to:
Provide our products and services;
Create and manage online accounts;
Send promotional materials, alerts regarding available offers and other communications, including
            communications through the Services and outside of the Services, such as via email and through
            third-party websites and apps;
Communicate about, and administer participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers,
            surveys, contests and market research;
Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement
            agencies;
Anonymize personal information to provide third parties with aggregated data reports showing
            anonymized information and other non-personal information;
Supplement your personal information collected from you with additional information from publicly
            and commercially available sources, and/or information from third-party services;
Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of
            providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and
            other operational/business purposes.
Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing, enhancing, analyzing and
            improving our Services; managing our communications; performing data analytics; and performing
            accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other
            liabilities; and
Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual
            obligations and our policies.
In addition, we and our third-party service providers may use information collected through automated
        means including cookies, web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies for purposes
        such as (1) customizing our users’ visits to and use of our Services, (2) delivering content (including
        advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users use our Services, and
        (3) managing our Services and other aspects of our business.
We may use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The
        analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web
        server logs and similar technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services. The information
        collected through these means may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third
        parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services. To learn more about how to
        opt out of Google Analytics services, please visit the link below:

We also may use your personal information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time
        of collection.
Information We Share
We may share customer personal information with:
Service providers in the US and other jurisdictions who perform services on our behalf.
Our third party clients or business partners, such as publishers and social media networks, for
            marketing purposes, such as targeted promotional emails.
In addition, when the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person,
        we may share it with third parties.
We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process,
        (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure
        is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an
        investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to
        transfer personal information we have about you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer
        of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or
        liquidation).

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you, such as how
        we communicate with you.

        future sale of your data. Please note Olive Tree does not at this time sell any personal information.
How We Protect and Retain Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information we
        have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access,
        disclosure or use. We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of
        the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of such
        personal information.
We retain personal information for the period needed to fulfill the purposes for which the personal
        information was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to
        our record retention obligations.
Transfers of Information
The Services may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially
        provided the information, including the United States. We may transfer the personal information we
        collect about you to the United States and/or another country, which may not be deemed to have the same
        data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When your personal
        information is in such countries, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security
        authorities in accordance with applicable law. If you are a user located outside the United States or the
        country to which your information may be transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal
        information processed in the United States and/or such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies
        and other tracking technologies as described above. When we transfer your information, we will protect
        that information as described in this Notice.

For your convenience and information, our Services may provide links to third-party sites, apps and
        services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with Olive Tree Bible Software. These companies
        may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices of any sites, apps, or services outside our Company.
Updates to Our Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our
        personal information practices. For significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice
        on our Services indicating at the top of the Notice when it was most recently updated.

Information We Obtain
We obtain personal information about customers through our Services, publicly and commercially available
        sources, and from some third-party services (such as social media networks). The types of personal
        information we may obtain include:
Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);
Username and password when you register through our Services;
Geolocation data;
Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” or “Contact Us” feature; and
Behavioral data such as website pages visited or time spent using our Services.
Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services
We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies
        (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar
        technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services.
        The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser
        characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
        information on actions taken on our Services, and dates and times you access or use our Services. In
        connection with our mobile apps, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to
        uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon”
        also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies
        and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these
        automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other
        content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website,
        a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and
        store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.
We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device
        information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you
        have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may
        have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be
        notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of
        cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of
        our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple
        and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with us through our apps or
        other app developers.
In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social
        media network (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from
        the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social
        media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends
        lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social
        media network.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media
        sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with
        these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject
        to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. Our Company is not responsible for those providers’
        information practices.
How We Use the Information We Obtain
We may use the information collected from and about you to:
Provide our products and services;
Create and manage online accounts;
Send promotional materials, alerts regarding available offers and other communications, including
            communications through the Services and outside of the Services, such as via email and through
            third-party websites and apps;
Communicate about, and administer participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers,
            surveys, contests and market research;
Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement
            agencies;
Anonymize personal information to provide third parties with aggregated data reports showing
            anonymized information and other non-personal information;
Supplement your personal information collected from you with additional information from publicly
            and commercially available sources, and/or information from third-party services;
Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of
            providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and
            other operational/business purposes.
Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing, enhancing, analyzing and
            improving our Services; managing our communications; performing data analytics; and performing
            accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other
            liabilities; and
Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual
            obligations and our policies.
In addition, we and our third-party service providers may use information collected through automated
        means including cookies, web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies for purposes
        such as (1) customizing our users’ visits to and use of our Services, (2) delivering content (including
        advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users use our Services, and
        (3) managing our Services and other aspects of our business.
We may use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The
        analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web
        server logs and similar technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services. The information
        collected through these means may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third
        parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services. To learn more about how to
        opt out of Google Analytics services, please visit the link below:

We also may use your personal information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time
        of collection.
Information We Share
We may share customer personal information with:
Service providers in the US and other jurisdictions who perform services on our behalf.
Our third party clients or business partners, such as publishers and social media networks, for
            marketing purposes, such as targeted promotional emails.
In addition, when the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person,
        we may share it with third parties.
We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process,
        (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure
        is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an
        investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to
        transfer personal information we have about you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer
        of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or
        liquidation).
Your Choices
We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you, such as how
        we communicate with you.

        future sale of your data. Please note Olive Tree does not at this time sell any personal information.
How We Protect and Retain Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information we
        have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access,
        disclosure or use. We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of
        the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of such
        personal information.
We retain personal information for the period needed to fulfill the purposes for which the personal
        information was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to
        our record retention obligations.
Transfers of Information
The Services may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially
        provided the information, including the United States. We may transfer the personal information we
        collect about you to the United States and/or another country, which may not be deemed to have the same
        data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When your personal
        information is in such countries, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security
        authorities in accordance with applicable law. If you are a user located outside the United States or the
        country to which your information may be transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal
        information processed in the United States and/or such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies
        and other tracking technologies as described above. When we transfer your information, we will protect
        that information as described in this Notice.
Links to Third-Party Sites, Apps and Services
For your convenience and information, our Services may provide links to third-party sites, apps and
        services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with Olive Tree Bible Software. These companies
        may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices of any sites, apps, or services outside our Company.
Updates to Our Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our
        personal information practices. For significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice
        on our Services indicating at the top of the Notice when it was most recently updated.

CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES
California Consumers may have certain rights in connection with the personal information we collect
        about you, many of which are subject to exceptions under applicable law:
The right to access and disclosure.
You may have the right to request, twice
        during a twelve-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected
        about you during the past 12 months:
the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you
the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information
the business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information
the categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information
the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the
            categories of third parties to whom we sold or disclosed that information for a business purpose.
The right to deletion.
You may have the right to request that we delete the
        personal information we have collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests
        under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.
        If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
How to exercise your access and deletion rights.
California residents may
        exercise their California privacy rights by sending an email to
support@olivetree.com
, or by
        contacting us at 1-800-277-3110.
For security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you
        -- when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. For instance, you may need to provide
        your name and email address. To request that we provide you with the specific pieces of personal
        information we have from you or to delete personal information we have collected from you, we may need
        to ask you for additional information to verify your identity.
Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as
        appropriate:
Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we
            will describe the type and format of the information disclosure.
Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information
            you have requested, except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the
            CCPA. For instance, we may not disclose government ID or financial account number as such disclosure
            may create an unreasonable risk to your personal information, your account with us, or our business
            systems.
Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we
            will delete, deidentify, or aggregate any information about you that is not necessary for the
            purposes indicated above. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you
        additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.
The right to nondiscrimination.
We will not deny, charge different prices for,
        or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.
The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Olive Tree does
            not at this time sell any personal information.
However, you have the right to opt out of any potential
        future sale of your personal information. California law broadly defines sale such that it may include
        allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address and/or browsing
        behavior, to deliver targeted advertising. If you would like to opt out of any potential future sale of
        your personal information,
you may do so here
.
Authorized Agents
You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above.
        We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed
        above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through
        providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.
HOW TO CONTACT US

support@olivetree.com
or call us at
        1-800-277-3110. To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity

        extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
Olive Tree does not currently sell any personal information, under the definitions of "sell" for
                        the CCPA. However, if you would like to opt-out of any potential future sale of your personal
                        information, you may do so by entering your email address below. An email with a verification
