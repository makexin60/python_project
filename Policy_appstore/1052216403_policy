database resources to run the apps.
Data is encrypted at rest and the Google Cloud has been checked for
special technical and organizational data security measures.
We have concluded an order processing agreement (AVV) with Google for
the Cloud Platform.
The Google Cloud Platform is provided to us by Google Cloud EMEA
Limited, 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. Google Cloud
EMEA Limited is part of an international group of companies whose parent
company, Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View,

storage location for the data. Nevertheless, in exceptional cases it is
possible that the data is transferred to so-called third countries
outside the EU or the European Economic Area.
In order to ensure an adequate level of data protection when
transferring data to a third country, Google Cloud EMEA Limited has
committed to us to agree on standard data protection clauses with
recipients in third countries, which have been issued by the European
Commission for this purpose. We will be happy to provide you with a copy

Google Firebase
We use various Google Firebase services to analyze app crashes and make
configuration changes to installed apps. Here, we use all possibilities
to deactivate the collection of personal data such as the advertising or
provider ID or to anonymize it in advance (IP address), so that no
personal data is processed by Firebase except for a temporary FireBase

Technical safety precautions
We do not store any data on the end device of our users (neither mobile
app nor web app) to ensure the greatest possible security and to enable
smooth functioning. We store the personal data of our users processed in
the web and mobile app as part of online psychotherapy or unaccompanied
use of the app on servers of our IT service providers within the
European Union, who process this data on our behalf and on the legal
basis of Art. 28 GDPR and are obliged to comply with the legal
provisions on data protection and data security.
The data center we use is an ISO 27001, ISO 27017 and ISO 27018
certified hosting provider. The European ISO 27001 certification is
consistent with the requirements of the German Federal Office for
Information Security (BSI). The European ISO 27017 certification is an
international standard for securing cloud services (cloud security),
which is supplemented by ISO 27018, particularly with regard to the
protection of personal data (cloud privacy). All communication between
the user and the technical platform takes place exclusively on the basis
of the latest encryption technology. Encryption is automatic and does
not require any intervention by the user. One or more encryption
mechanisms are used in the process. For example, all new data stored on
non-volatile storage is encrypted in accordance with the AES-256
standard, with each encryption key in turn being encrypted with a set of
master keys that are changed regularly. Access to the individual user
profile and the data stored therein by the user is exclusively by means
of an individual username-password combination known only to the user.
Users determine their passwords themselves. Certain compulsory
requirements are placed on the selected password, so that every password
must achieve a minimum level of security. An algorithm checks how secure
the password is when it is created and informs the user of this in real
time. Forgotten passwords cannot be recovered, as they are stored
exclusively in encrypted form on the server. Instead, a link is sent to
the user by email, with which he can assign himself a new password. We
also take a variety of precautions to protect personal data and prevent
misuse. All of our applications communicate with our servers over
encrypted connections using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or HTTPS,
which prevents third parties from unauthorized reading of data while it
is being sent (i.e., "in transit"). Both servers and databases are
located behind firewalls to prevent access to data during storage (i.e.
"at-rest") and during processing (i.e. "in process"), respectively. In
order to independently check system security, test attacks (penetration
tests) are carried out at least once a year by an external IT security
company on the servers provided and attempts are made to gain
unauthorized access to them on a test basis.
Storage & Data Deletion
We store your personal data, which we collect for the purpose of
concluding and fulfilling a contract with you for as long as this is
necessary for contract negotiation and fulfillment.
We store your personal data at most until you revoke your consent. We
will delete your data at the latest, 5 years after the last usage of the
application.
Please keep in mind uninstalling the app will not delete your data.
The storage period for the documents relevant to the sales tax payment
is 10 years after the end of the accounting year in which the service
was provided.
The data will be anonymised for fulfilling our post market surveillance
requirements once a data deletion request is executed.
Regardless of the right to data deletion pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR (see
also the rights of data subjects), the data can be deleted directly in
the app in the "Profile > Data & Security" at any time. Before this,
they can be transferred or backed up using an automatic export function.
Alternatively, any user can write this request by email from the address
registered with us to
service@minddoc.de
.
We will then check this immediately and contact you.
Requirement or obligation to provide data
Unless expressly stated at the time of collection, the provision of data
is not required or obligatory. Such an obligation may result from legal
requirements or contractual regulations.
Use of app in a potentially unsafe environment
Security risks may arise when using the app in unsafe situations, like
open and unencrypted wireless networks, unattended public phones or
rooted devices or an external virus attack.
We recommend using the app only in secure environments only on your
private device with appropriate security settings.
Even with the exhaustion of as many technical and organizational
security precautions as possible, 100% security cannot be guaranteed,
even by us - that is why we recommend that you as a user pay close
attention to the following tips and implement them as far as possible:
Basic protection:
Check the settings of your device (smartphone, laptop, tablet) to see
which security features are available and activate them (e.g., access
restriction via fingerprint/face recognition, device discovery,
two-factor authentication).
Keep your focus:
Use your smartphone only when you can fully concentrate on it and do not
perform any parallel activities that require your attention (e.g.
driving a car, crossing a street).
Control the view on your display:
Make sure that you only enter/read/change confidential content on your
smartphone (e.g. entering personal data or information about your
(mental) health) if you are sure that no one is watching you who is not
supposed to.
Be careful with public and company networks:
Do not use insecure networks or public Wi-Fi hotspots without a
password, or use apps that create a virtual private network (VPN). In
internal company networks, access to certain content may be restricted
or blocked, or activities may be recorded.
Secure access:
Make sure you enable an access restriction (e.g. passcode, fingerprint,
facial recognition, password) for unlocking your device and for apps
with sensitive content. Locking the screen with a pattern is usually
easy to circumvent and therefore not secure.
Stay up to date:
Regularly install the latest updates for your operating system and apps,
as the manufacturers often introduce new features and close security
gaps.
Version of the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change our privacy policy if this should be
necessary due to updates in regulations or app software.
If fundamental changes are made to this data protection declaration, we
will inform you of them.
You can call up the data protection declaration at any time in the
"Profile" section of the app.

”: this refers to information relating to the Customer’s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer’s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g. add to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).
While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (“
PII
“), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such. Within the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer. However, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII. This includes, for example, a Customer using an End User’s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier. If a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.
Registration Information Received and Processed by AppsFlyer
When a Customer registers to use the Services, we may collect certain information related to such Customer (“

With regards to Registration Information and Log Data, the lawful basis AppsFlyer relies on is its need to perform its obligations under the Agreement between AppsFlyer and Customer and on its legitimate interests to maintain, analyze and improve the Services.

The right to withdraw any previously provided consent;

initial online therapy consultation is explicitly not affected by this. By using this service,

Use of the newsletter and use of CleverReach
In some areas of the website we offer registration to a newsletter for interested parties.
This is voluntary and is not linked to any incentive program or similar - the website can also
be used without restrictions without this service.
However, as this service is provided by an external service provider, we ask you to note the following:
The dispatch of the emails and the processing of personal data (e-mail address) is carried out by means
of the dispatch service provider "CleverReach", a newsletter dispatch platform of the provider
CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, Schafjückenweg 2, 26180 Rastede, Germany.
Privacy policy of the shipping service provider:
Privacy Policy - CleverReach
The legal basis for the commissioning of the shipping service provider is the consent of
the user pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.
The dispatch service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e. without
assignment to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimize the dispatch
and presentation of the newsletters or for statistical purposes. However, the dispatch service provider
does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass the data on to third parties.
The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server
when the newsletter is opened, or if we use a shipping service provider, from their server.
Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information on the browser
and system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval are initially collected.
This information is used for the technical improvement of the services based on the technical data or
the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined
with the help of the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether
newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this
information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor,
if used, that of the dispatch service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us
much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send
different content according to the interests of our users.
The legal basis is the consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR.
2.1.3 Technical services for the presentation, display and optimized use of the website
Font Awesome
Our website uses so-called web fonts provided by Fonticons, Inc. for the uniform display
of fonts. When a page is called up, the browser loads the required web fonts into the browser
cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly. For this purpose, the browser used must
establish a connection to the servers of Fonticons, Inc. This enables Fonticons, Inc. to know
that our website has been accessed via the IP address used.
The use of web fonts is in the interest of a uniform and appealing presentation of our online offers.
This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
If the browser in use does not support web fonts, a default font from the device in use will be used.

logged in there. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your account.
You can prevent this by logging out before activating the button. Google stores your data (even for
users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. The collection, storage and
evaluation are carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of
your consent. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you

your data to Google in the context of the use of Google Maps, you also have the option of completely
deactivating the Google Maps web service by turning off the JavaScript application in your browser.
Google Maps and thus also the map display on this website can then not be used. You can view

In order to implement online psychotherapy, we collect and process both general personal data
and data relating to health. Health data are all data that relate to the physical or mental
health of a patient. This includes, for example, data that are clearly related to health, as
well as data that allow conclusions to be drawn about the state of health or where conclusions
have already been drawn about the state of health, regardless of whether they are correct or
incorrect. These processed data can represent health data both individually and in an overall view.
Important note: Storage or recording of the video calls does not take place without prior, separate consent.
3.1 Purposes for which personal data are processed
MindDoc may only process patient data if a legal basis requires or permits this or if the
patient gives consent to do so:
First of all, data is required to create a user account as a patient. In this context, a
comparison is made with existing user data from the MindDoc app (MindDoc Health) in
order to meet the objectives of data security and economy and to avoid duplication of
accounts. This is done to protect the interests of the users concerned on the basis of
legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR and as part of the
shared responsibility agreement pursuant to Article 26 GDPR.
Processing and Storage of contact details of emergency contacts for the fulfilment of our therapeutic
duty of care (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. c in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h, para. 3 GDPR).
For treatment (online psychotherapy), processing of patient data is necessary in particular
for preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, curative and also aftercare reasons.
In addition, the data is processed with regard to interdisciplinary conferences for the
analysis and discussion of diagnostics and therapy, for preliminary, joint and further care
with regard to diagnostics, therapy, findings and disease / vital status. All these processes
are carried out to ensure the best possible treatment.
In addition to this patient-related processing, administrative and support processing is also
required. This essentially requires the processing of data for the billing of treatment,
for reasons of controlling or auditing, for the assertion, exercise and defense of legal claims, etc.
Data processing is also carried out for the purposes of training, continuing education and
further training of physicians and of members of other health care professions, as well as
for reasons of support and maintenance of IT systems and applications, and in the event of
troubleshooting technical errors or questions from individual patients
The data can also be used for quality and analysis purposes to improve therapy processes,
content, as well as to improve the user experience during online psychotherapy.
Patient data may be required as part of measuring the effect size of online therapy for
internal quality assurance purposes and to measure the stability of treatment delivery via
standardized questionnaires sent to patients 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of regular therapy.
3.1.1 Details of the personal data processed
The following personal data may be collected by MindDoc in the course of online psychotherapy:
Patients and Therapeutic users (psychotherapists, psychiatrists)
- First name(s)
- Last name(s)
- Title (e.g. Dr., Prof.)
- E-mail address
- Date of birth
- Postal address
- Phone number
- Gender
- IP address
- Profile photo
Details of booked appointments for initial diagnostic consultations and (regular) online therapy appointments.
- Time (start, end)
- Notes
Therapeutic users (psychotherapists, psychiatrists) only
- Areas of specialization, focus and introductory texts
For patients only
- Contact data of third parties in the context of a specified emergency contact (e-mail address, first name, last name)
The following data with reference acc. to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h GDPR, can be collected by MindDoc in the context of online psychotherapy from patients:
Reason for treatment (i.e. reason for visit such as depression, eating disorder, burnout, tinnitus, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder).
Contents of the anamnesis as well as the clarification discussion and the clarification documentation between patient and therapist
Cost unit/health insurance
Insurance number
Treatment pathway (i.e. regular online therapy, aftercare, initial interview diagnosis).
Qualitative responses and notes entered in writing in therapy sessions, questionnaires,
or within electronic chat (e.g., responses about medication use, occupation, family relationships,
thoughts and feelings).
Quantitative values from therapeutic questionnaires (e.g., PHQ 9 scores) and thus symptom trajectories.
Number and type of therapy lessons selected and prescribed, as well as their processing
status (e.g., open, in process, feedback pending, completed)
Date, time, duration, and type of activities between patient and therapist or patient
management (e.g., video therapy, chat message, therapy session assigned)
Information on suicidality by the patient
Important note and notes from the initial diagnostic interview (e.g., notes on suicidality).
Contents for the documentation of findings by the therapist
3.1.2 Legal basis
When using MindDoc online psychotherapy, i.e. upon completion of registration as well as use
of the platform, we collect personal data in order to enable the use of MindDoc and a successful
course of online psychotherapy. Registration can take place in the following two ways:
Booking of an initial diagnostic consultation at one of our initial consultation
sites including creation of a user account at
https://www.booking.minddoc.com
By inviting to registration and final independent completion of the user account on
https://therapy.minddoc.com/
The basis for MindDoc being allowed to process data under data protection law arises mainly
from the fact that MindDoc is responsible for the treatment of patients. Thus, for proper
administrative processing of treatment and related tasks, the recording of personal and health
data is indispensable.  There are numerous laws and regulations that allow MindDoc to process
the data, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Articles 6 and 9 GDPR.
In addition, there are principles in German law, such as the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG),
in particular Section 22 BDSG, and in the German Civil Code (BGB) in Sections 630 et seq. BGB,
which requires processing of the above-mentioned data.
The legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data in the course of treatment
is Art. 9 (2) (h), (3) GDPR.
The following are examples of the legal bases for individual processing operations:
Data processing for the purpose of carrying out as well as documenting the treatment
process including the intra-medical and inter-professional exchange within MindDoc about
the patient for the treatment (Art. 9 para. 2h, para. 3, para. 4 GDPR in conjunction with
§§ 630a ff, 630f BGB),
Data transfer to "external parties" in the sense of joint treatment (in a team), consultation
of external consultants, e.g. laboratory, telemedicine, as well as consultation of external
therapists (Art. 9 (2h), (3), (4) GDPR),
Data transfer to the statutory health insurance companies for the purpose of billing (Art. 9 para. 2h, para. 3, para. 4 GDPR),
In addition, processing is also permitted in cases where the patient as well as the therapist have given consent, such as storage or recording of video calls.
Follow-up survey via online questionnaires. However, this only takes place in the case of consent by the patient, Art. 9 (2) lit a GDPR.
3.1.3 Sources of data within the framework of online psychotherapy MindDoc
MindDoc generally collects the necessary data from the users (i.e. patients, therapists, administrators)
themselves. In some cases, however, we may receive personal data from other therapists,
hospitals that carried out the initial / preliminary treatment, physicians in private practice,
specialists, medical care centers (MVZs), etc. This data is merged with the other data of a
patient for the purposes of uniform documentation. MindDoc combines this data with the other
data of a patient in the sense of uniform documentation.
3.1.4 Access authorization to online psychotherapy data
The persons involved in the treatment (i.e. esp. therapists, psychiatrists, physicians)
have access to patient data. This data is processed by specialist staff or under their responsibility.
This specialist personnel is either subject to professional secrecy or a duty of confidentiality.
If required for administrative purposes, an administrative employee (e.g. patient management,
technical support) can also access patient data (personal as well as health-related data).
The confidential handling of your data is also ensured here by corresponding confidentiality obligations.
3.1.5 Possible recipients of data
All data will be collected within the scope of the intended purpose in compliance with the
respective data protection regulations or any existing declarations of consent and, if necessary,
transmitted to third parties. Such third parties are in particular:
statutory health insurers provided that a patient is covered by statutory health insurance,
private health insurances if a patient is privately insured,
Medical experts of the Medical Service of the Health Insurance Funds (MDK) for the assessment
of services rendered, for the initiation of services for participation or in case of incapacity for work.
Medical reviewers from insurance companies to evaluate renewal applications.
Accident insurance carrier,
Primary care physicians,
further, after or with treating physicians and/or therapists,
Other health care or treatment facilities,
Rehabilitation facilities,
Nursing Facilities,
external data processors (so-called order processors), taking into account the obligations
arising from Art. 28 GDPR: These oblige such service providers to comply with legal standards
with regard to data protection and data security. As a result, the processors are bound by our
instructions and are regularly monitored by us. Within the following categories, we use such
processors in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR, which are necessary for the development and provision
of online therapy and related services: Hosting of data and applications, email dispatch,
customer support, provision and integration of course content.
The legal basis for the use of these third-party providers on Basis is our legitimate interest
in keeping MindDoc permanently maintained and evaluating its performance under Article 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
3.1.6 Special notes on the storage period of the online psychotherapy data
In accordance with § 630f BGB (German Civil Code), MindDoc Healthcare is obliged to keep
documentation on your treatment. This patient file must be kept by us for at least 10 years
and may be kept for up to 30 years in individual cases for reasons of preservation of evidence.

Rights of data subjects
All subjects under this privacy policy are entitled to so-called data subject rights, i.e.

Right of access to personal data processed by us.
Right to rectification, Art. 16 GDPR
Immediate correction of incorrect personal data concerning the user;
Right to object to unreasonable data processing, Art. 21 GDPR
If we process data on the basis of a legitimate interest, you can object to this data
processing at any time; this would also apply to profiling based on these provisions.
We will then no longer process data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds
for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of our users, or the
processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. The processing of user data
for the purpose of direct advertising can be objected to at any time without giving reasons.
Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten'), Art. 17 GDPR
The deletion of personal data under the conditions specified in the article; This is the case
in particular if they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were originally collected or processed.
Right to restriction of processing, Art. 18 GDPR
The restriction of the processing of personal data if certain reasons are
given. This means that, although the data is not deleted, it is marked
to restrict its further processing or use of the data.
Right to portability, Art. 20 GDPR
Users of the Services have, in principle, the right to receive the personal data concerning
them that they have provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and
to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from us; likewise, the User has
the right to demand that we transmit the personal data directly to another controller, insofar
as this is technically feasible; insofar as the processing is based on consent or is based on
a contract with us and the processing is carried out with the aid of automated processes.
Chapter 7
Other rights
In addition to the above rights, all our users have other rights:
7.1. Refusal and revocation of consent
If the processing of data is based on consent given to us, then every user has the right
to revoke this consent at any time. This declaration can be made informally, e.g. in writing,
by e-mail or fax to the persons responsible. A statement of reasons is not required for this.
However, the revocation is only valid from the time at which it is expressed. It has no retroactive
effect. The processing of data up to this point remains lawful.
7.2. Right of appeal
Irrespective of the fact that our users are also free to seek judicial assistance, they have
the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they believe that the processing
of their data is not permissible under data protection law. This results from Art. 77 GDPR.
The complaint to the supervisory authority can be made informally.
Chapter 8
Safeguarding the legitimate interests of the responsible parties
If one of the responsible parties is forced to seek legal or judicial assistance in order to

General notes on data security
9.1. Technical safety precautions
We do not store any data on the end device of our users (neither mobile app nor web app) to
ensure the greatest possible security and to enable smooth functioning. We store the
personal data of our users processed in the web and mobile app as part of online psychotherapy
or unaccompanied use of the app on servers of our IT service providers within the European Union,
who process this data on our behalf and on the legal basis of Art. 28 GDPR and are obliged to comply
with the legal provisions on data protection and data security. The data center we use is an
ISO 27001, ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 certified hosting provider. The European ISO 27001
certification is consistent with the requirements of the German Federal Office for Information
Security (BSI). The European ISO 27017 certification is an international standard for securing
cloud services (cloud security), which is supplemented by ISO 27018, particularly with regard
to the protection of personal data (cloud privacy).

All communication between the user and the technical platform takes place exclusively on the
basis of the latest encryption technology. Encryption is automatic and does not require
any intervention by the user. One or more encryption mechanisms are used in the process.
For example, all new data stored on non-volatile storage is encrypted in accordance with
the AES-256 standard, with each encryption key in turn being encrypted with a set of master
keys that are changed regularly. Access to the individual user profile and the data stored
therein by the user is exclusively by means of an individual username-password combination
known only to the user. Users determine their passwords themselves. Certain compulsory requirements
are placed on the selected password, so that every password must achieve a minimum level of
security. An algorithm checks how secure the password is when it is created and informs the
user of this in real time. Forgotten passwords cannot be recovered, as they are stored exclusively
in encrypted form on the server. Instead, a link is sent to the user by e-mail, with which he
can assign himself a new password.

We also take a variety of precautions to protect personal data and prevent misuse. All of our
applications communicate with our servers over encrypted connections using TLS (Transport
Layer Security) or HTTPS, which prevents third parties from unauthorized reading of data while
it is being sent (i.e., "in transit"). Both servers and databases are located behind firewalls
to prevent access to data during storage (i.e. "at-rest") and during processing (i.e. "in process"),
respectively. In order to independently check system security, test attacks (penetration tests)
are carried out at least once a year by an external IT security company on the servers provided
and attempts are made to gain unauthorized access to them on a test basis.
9.2. Other notes and recommendations on data security
Even with the exhaustion of as many technical and organizational security precautions as
possible, 100% security cannot be guaranteed, even by us - that is why we recommend that
you as a user pay close attention to the following tips and implement them as far as possible:
Basic protection:
Check the settings of your device (smartphone, laptop, tablet) to see which security
features are available and activate them (e.g., access restriction via fingerprint/face
recognition, device discovery, two-factor authentication).
Keep your focus:
Use your smartphone only when you can fully concentrate on it and do not perform any parallel activities that require your attention (e.g. driving a car, crossing a street).
Control the view on your display:
Make sure that you only enter/read/change confidential content on your smartphone (e.g. entering personal data or information about your (mental) health) if you are sure that no one is watching you who is not supposed to.
Be careful with public and company networks:
Do not use insecure networks or public Wi-Fi hotspots without a password, or use apps
that create a virtual private network (VPN). In internal company networks, access to
certain content may be restricted or blocked, or activities may be recorded.
Secure access:
Make sure you enable an access restriction (e.g. passcode, fingerprint, facial recognition, password) for unlocking your device and for apps with sensitive content. Locking the screen with a pattern is usually easy to circumvent and therefore not secure.
Stay up to date:
Regularly install the latest updates for your operating system and apps, as the manufacturers often introduce new features and close security gaps.
