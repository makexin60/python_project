Mapway Privacy Policy
Here at Mapway, we believe that you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.
We want to empower you to make the best decisions, for you, about the information you share with us.
This is the purpose of our Privacy Policy.
You should read this Policy in full, but here are a few key points that we’d like you to take away:
Unlike other services, we do not require that you register with us or provide personal information such as your name, email address or phone number to use our services, they are offered to you free of charge and we will never collect this data unless you choose to provide them by contacting us.
Mapway is a private company which offers users free apps.
To pay for the maintenance and enhancement of these free apps we need to be able to monetise your use of our apps, primarily we do this through advertising.
To do this and to make adverts more relevant for you we will request that you allow us to receive some personal information from you such as your device ID (IDFA or AAID) and location; you may of course decline these requests.
As an alternative you can Subscribe to our Free apps, or where available, pay for our Pro versions.
As well as adding premium features, where available, this also removes advertising and significantly reduce the amount of data we collect from your use of our apps (see the full Policy).
In addition to Subscriptions your device also gives you control to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it.
Ultimately you can also choose to delete and stop using the app at which point any data collection will cease.
By using our apps, our website or contacting us you agree to the collection and use of certain data as described in this Policy.
We are the data controller, which means that we will determine the purposes for processing your personal data and the manner in which processing is carried out.
This Privacy Policy describes how we will use your personal data. If you have any queries on how we use your personal data, please contact us at
privacyteam@mapway.com
.
This Privacy Policy was last updated 12
th
May 2023.
We reserve the right to make changes to it and publish the latest version which shall then apply.
Information you share with us
We do not require you to directly provide any personal information to us to start using our services.
It is not necessary for you to have created an account, nor will we ever make your use of our apps public, other than occasionally quoting user reviews posted in app stores on our website or in other publicity.
Should you contact us directly (either via the app, website or a direct email) you will be providing your name, email address and (when contacting us from the app) an app ID.
We will keep the content of your message and contact information to enable us to respond to your request and feedback to our team, but for no other reason.
If using our myTrains service you will need to provide us with payment information, including your debit or credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code and billing address, in order to purchase train tickets.
We will never require that you provide payment information for any other services, all Subscriptions or the purchase of Pro versions of our apps is transacted via the appropriate app store and we never receive payment information about you from them.
Any carbon offset subscription you take out via our partner Furthr will be transacted by them and governed by their privacy policy (
https://furthr.earth/privacy-policy
).
Use of Shop & Save (where available) connects you with merchants through our trusted technology and transaction processing partner Kindred and is governed by their privacy policy (
https://event.kindred.co/privacy-policy
).
Additional information we receive about you – all users
Location information:
We require information about your current location to effectively offer you our services.
Subject to your settings, we may collect, use and store additional information about your location to operate or personalise our services such as nearest transit stops, transport disruption, etc.
You control whether we collect this data at all times or only when you are using the app, or even if we can collect this data at all.
If you choose not to share location, we will be unable to offer you our full level of intended service which relies on this data.
Cookies:
Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.
Analytic Data
:
We receive information when you interact with our apps and website, which we refer to as “Analytic Data”. For example, when you open the app we record this as a session so we can monitor which of our apps are being used most often, at what times of the day, etc; if the app crashes we log the screen you were viewing and other data such as if you have mobile reception to help us identify the cause of such crashes and fix them.
This information is collected by third-party SDKs (as identified later in this Policy) and we receive anonymised reports from this data to help us enhance our services.
Apple music services:
The Playlists feature in our Bus Times London app makes use of MusicKit on iOS 11 and above. This feature requires access to Apple Music, your music and video activity and your media library so that we can provide you with personalised playlists to listen to on your journey.
Granting this permission is necessary for the Playlists feature to work. We will never access your music for any other reason and will never access your non-music media (such as video or photos). In addition, we will never analyse or store your music preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time through your device settings.
Additional information we receive about you – certain users
The additional information we receive about you depends on whether you have purchased a Pro version or a Subscription.
If you have made these purchases, then this section does not apply to you.
Location information:
As well as offering our full service if you have not purchased our Pro or on of our Subscriptions we may share location data with other third-party partners (as identified in this Policy) for activities such as the personalisation of adverts so these may be more relevant and useful for you.
Links:
If you click on an ad in our apps, that advertiser may know that you came from a Mapway app, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach.
Advertisers and Other Ad Partners:
Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads within the app and outside of it. Our ad partners and affiliates collect information such as advertising IDs and location where you have granted permission. Our ad partners collect the data via SDKs and this is not shared with us.
Information we share and disclose
Payment information:
If using myTrains we share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.
Service providers:
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help us understand the use of our services, such as Flurry Analytics and Google Analytics. We may share your personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
Law, Harm, and the Public Interest:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data if we believe that it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platforms; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s request to disclose your personal data.
Change of Ownership:
I
n the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity.
Non-Personal Information:
We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of downloads, monthly active users or sessions, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.
Advertisers:
If you have not purchased a Pro version of the app or a Subscription then we may provide to third party advertising partners information about your activity on our app and your location. These partners may collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities to provide you contextual advertising based upon your interests and activity.
Our legal basis of processing data
We collect, use and share the data we have in the ways described above:
As necessary to deliver our Services to you;
As necessary to comply with our legal obligations;
As necessary for our (and others’) legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative, personalised and profitable service to our users and partners.
Managing your personal information with us
You control the personal data you share with us. You can access or rectify this data at any time. You can also stop using our apps.
Retention: When you give us any personal information, we will only hold this for as long as we need to perform the activities detailed in this Policy or have a valid reason to keep it.
We will also consider the type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements when considering retention.
We design our services so that we don’t hold your information any longer than we must.
EU, EFTA & UK:
If you are located in the UK, European Union or EFTA States, you can confidentially contact Mapway’s Privacy Team by emailing
privacyteam@mapway.com
. If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.
Your rights under GDPR are as follows:
You have the right to be informed about our processing of your personal data;
You have the right to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal data completed;
You have the right to object to us processing your personal data;
You have the right to have your personal data erased, otherwise known as the ‘right to be forgotten’;
You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, and information on how we process it, commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’;
You have the right to move, copy or transfer your personal data (‘data portability’); and
You have rights in relation to automated decision making, including profiling.
You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
It has enforcement powers and can investigate compliance with data protection laws.
More information about the Information Commissioner’s Office can be found on their website –
www.ico.org.uk
.
Personal Control:
There are the ways in which you control the sharing and use of your information and ultimately you can also stop using our services and any time and delete our app so that no data is collected:
Remove Ads: Subscribing will stop your device making requests for adverts and the sharing of your data with third parties for commercial purposes.
Limit Ad Tracking: You will be asked whether you will allow ad tracking.
Even if you allow this you can remove this authority at any time from within your device settings.
In doing so you will still receive adverts, but they will be less relevant to you (and so probably more of an annoyance) as less information is made available to the advertisers.
Analytics data: We use this data anonymously to help us improve and fix bugs within our apps.
You can remove this from the settings in your device.
Location data: We need this data to provide our full services.
You can limit this within the settings on your device.
Our Global Operations
To bring you our services, we operate globally. Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in the United Kingdom, and any other country where we operate. In some of the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of your country.
If we transfer personal data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we will ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws and contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the data.
Your privacy and protection are important to us, and we will not transfer your personal data until we are satisfied that your personal data will be protected.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be at
https://www.mapway.com/privacy-policy-permissions/
. If we make a change to this Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an in-app notification, instigating our full app on-boarding process or any other method we consider appropriate. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

Kindred Global Privacy Notices
Last updated 27 November 2024
In this privacy notice, we describe who we are, and how we look after your data. This notice applies to you if you browse our website, use the Kindred App, Kindred SDK, browser extension, APO's as well as the Add-on for Samsung (each are identified separately below).
You can manage your privacy preferences by contacting us on
privacy@kindredteam.com
or if you have used the Kindred CMP you can use that mechanism.
Part 1: Our approach
This section introduces us, the role we play in relation to your data, and our approach to protecting your data.
Who are we?
We are Kindred Soul Limited, a UK limited company, (‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’, ‘Kindred’) with a registered office at PEM, Salisbury House, Station Rd, Cambridge CB1 2LA.
We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner's Office under number ZA728760.
For any queries or requests relating to your data, how we collect or process it, or anything to do with this privacy notice, please contact us at privacy@kindredteam.com
What do we do?
Kindred provides several products on our platform/service that displays coupon codes and offers provided by advertisers as you shop online. In addition, Kindred will plant trees/donate to charities as purchases are made using commission paid by advertisers when you purchase online.
Kindred works with advertisers to provide insights into shopping behaviour and audience curation services, while users get access to discount codes to save money at advertisers. Kindred collects commission due from validated transactions from the advertiser and consent to the collection of data necessary to run the service.
What is this notice about?
We take your rights very seriously and have built our service to collect the minimum data necessary to provide a great service to you and our advertisers. Please take the time to understand how we collect, use, and process your data.
We collect and use certain data to deliver the Kindred experience to you when you use: our websites, www.kindred.co and app.kindred.co and sdk.kindred.co (collectively the ‘Websites’), The Kindred app (from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store), the Kindred SDK, Kindred API service and the add-on for Samsung or other services (collectively the ‘Services’). Kindred serves as the data controller unless stated otherwise.
Our data capture technology is unique in that it has been designed to selectively capture a limited range1 of your shopping preferences. Kindred does not collect data indiscriminately and only captures data necessary to provide its services to you and to its clients and their third-party vendors. This enables Kindred to use IDs to work with approved third parties and provide insights and audience curation services. In return our users get additional benefits such as exclusive discounts and collectively contribute to environmental and charitable causes.
Kindred services are not intended for children, and we do not knowingly process data relating to children.
Please read this policy carefully so that you understand your rights in relation to your personal data, and how we will collect, use and process your personal data. If you do not agree with how we do this, please do not use our services or use this Website any further. Kindred participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Kindred’s identification number is 1245. Kindred operates the Consent Management Platform.

Legal basis: what it means
Data protection law requires that we only process your personal data when we have identified a valid legal basis to do so. There are six available legal bases for processing. No single basis is ‘better’ or more important than the others and depending on the relationship we have with you will determine which basis is most appropriate.
You’ll have seen one or more of the following identified as a legal basis (under ‘How we use it’ above):
Consent
Consent, as a lawful basis for us to process your personal data, means that we have asked you for your explicit consent to process your data. Pre-ticked boxes are not allowed to collect your consent and you can withdraw your consent at any time.
This also means that we can only process data under this basis if (a) we have been clear and unambiguous about the purposes for which we are processing your data, (b) that you have given your consent freely, and (c) we provide a means for you to withdraw your consent as easily as it was for you to give us your consent.
We must ask you for your permission (your ‘consent’) to process your data under the legal basis of consent before we process your data. If you have given your consent, you can withdraw it, which can be done by using the Kindred TCF CMP UI (if available), deactivating the browser extension, uninstalling the app, or emailing us at the address below.
If you withdraw your consent this does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Legitimate interest
Legitimate interest allows us to process your personal data for our own interests and this can include our commercial interests, or broader societal benefits, for example contributing to charities.
This also means that we must provide you the details of the processing as well as what our legitimate interests are. Importantly, we are also required to ensure that our interests do not override your rights.
We do not need to ask permission to process your data under legitimate interest, however you can object to this, which can be done by using the Kindred TCF CMP UI (a popup available on all our Websites and Services), deactivating the browser extension, uninstalling the app, or emailing us at the address below.
It is important to Kindred that you know and understand your rights regarding Kindred’s processing of your personal data, so we ask you to read ‘Part 3: Responsibilities and Rights’ carefully.
Part 3: Rights, responsibilities
This section describes our responsibilities and your rights with regard to your data.
Our responsibilities
Data Protection law requires that we process your personal data in accordance with established data protection principles
Principle
What it means
Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
We must only process your personal data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.
Purpose limitation
We collect your personal data only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.
Data minimisation
We ensure that your personal data is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the services that we are providing you.
Accuracy
We ensure that your personal data is accurate and where necessary, kept up to date.
Storage limitation
We ensure that your personal data is not kept in a form which allows for you to be identified for longer than is necessary.
Integrity and confidentiality
We process your personal data in a manner that ensures its security using appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect it against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.
Your rights
You have several rights under data protection law, that Kindred is required to uphold. It is important to recognise that not all rights apply all the time, which means some rights are dependent on our relationship and interactions with you.
Your right
What it means
Access
You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal data.
This right always applies, however there may be some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the personal data we process.
Rectification
You have the right to ask us to rectify any of your personal data that you think is inaccurate or incomplete.
This right always applies.
Erasure
You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data:
·       Where it is no longer required for purpose for which it was collected, or
·       Where you withdraw your prior consent to us processing it and we have no other legal ground for processing it, or
·       Where it is being processed unlawfully, or
·       When it must be erased to comply with a legal obligation, or
·       Where it is being used for direct marketing purposes where we have no legitimate grounds for us doing so.
Restriction
You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data:
·       Where it is inaccurate (allowing us to verify the accuracy), or
·       Where it is being processed unlawfully (and you want us to stop processing rather than erasing it), or
·       Where you have objected to us processing it while we’re verifying whether we have legitimate grounds for processing, or
·       Where it is no longer required for purpose for which it was collected, and you want us to keep it for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
Portability
You have the right to ask us to transfer the information you provided us from one organisation to another or give it to you.
This only applies if we are processing personal data based on your consent or as part of a contract, or in talks with you about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.
This only applies to personal data you have given us.
Objection
You have the right to object to processing your personal data if:
·       We are using legitimate interests as our lawful basis for processing, or
·       It is being used for direct marketing.
Withdraw consent
You have the right to withdraw your consent that you have previously given to us for one or more specified purposes to process your personal data.
This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
It may mean we are not able to provide certain products or services to you and we will advise you if this is the case.
Our other obligations
We are also required to tell you about a few other things
Your right
What it means
Complaints
You have the right to complain to a Supervisory Authority, in the UK that is the
Information Commissioner’s Office
.
We would however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a Supervisory Authority so please consider contacting us first.
Opting out of marketing emails
You can opt out of any marketing at any time by emailing us at
privacy@kindredteam.com
or by clicking the opt-out or unsubscribe button found in the footer of promotional emails.
Automated decision-making and profiling
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless you have given us your consent to do so, or it is necessary for entering into or the performance of a contract.
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we have collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at
privacy@kindredteam.com
.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
Disclosure of your data
Kindred shares your data to support its relationship and interactions with you, with those identified in ‘Part 4: Your Data’
Breaches
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Dealing with your requests
We will deal with your requests as soon as possible which may take up to 1 (one) month and if this is likely to take longer, we will contact you and explain the situation (possibly extended to 3 months where the law permits). Normally there is no charge, however we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive or we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Third-party sites
Our Website may provide links to the websites of third parties, for example, the brands and merchants that we're connecting you with. They have their own privacy notices, policies, procedures, and activities which we do not control. Please check their policies before you submit any information via those websites.
Security
Kindred is ISO27001 certified, and we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, destroyed, or accessed without authorisation. This includes consideration of security during the design and development of our services and products.
While no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be secure, we implement a range of commercially reasonable physical, technical, and procedural measures to help protect personal data. These measures include policies, confidentiality agreements with third parties, secure development practices, security due diligence of service providers, products, services that may be used.
Part 4: Your Data
This section lists our service providers and other entities, who may have access to your data when you use the Website or App.
As with most technology businesses, we use third parties to host our Website and App and manage certain processes and business operations. This means sharing your data. We do it only when strictly necessary and we make sure there are safeguards in place. If it requires transferring data outside of the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, we make sure that it's done under available lawful mechanisms.

Other disclosures
We will share your information with law enforcement agencies, public authorities and other organisations if legally required to do so, or if it's reasonably necessary to comply with the law, investigate and enforce any breaches of our terms of use, detect and prevent fraud or security breaches, reduce our credit risk exposure, and protect the rights and safety of Kindred and our users. We may share data with our service providers such as IT or security service providers, to ensure that our services are maintained. If we sell our business, we may need to disclose your data to the prospective buyer, and your data will form part of the assets transferred to the buyer on completion of the sale. We may also operate as a data processor on behalf of our clients. This means we process personal data strictly under their instructions and in accordance with the terms outlined in the Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with those clients.
Kindred does not collect or process any sensitive personal data (special categories of data), such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, health data, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.
Kindred does not collect or process any personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences.
Well done for reaching the end!
We'd love you to be comfortable with how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or suggestions, please email
privacy@kindredteam.com

Sub-policy 2
https://www.mapway.com/privacy-policy-permissions/:
Mapway Privacy Policy
Here at Mapway, we believe that you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.
We want to empower you to make the best decisions, for you, about the information you share with us.
This is the purpose of our Privacy Policy.
You should read this Policy in full, but here are a few key points that we’d like you to take away:
Unlike other services, we do not require that you register with us or provide personal information such as your name, email address or phone number to use our services, they are offered to you free of charge and we will never collect this data unless you choose to provide them by contacting us.
Mapway is a private company which offers users free apps.
To pay for the maintenance and enhancement of these free apps we need to be able to monetise your use of our apps, primarily we do this through advertising.
To do this and to make adverts more relevant for you we will request that you allow us to receive some personal information from you such as your device ID (IDFA or AAID) and location; you may of course decline these requests.
As an alternative you can Subscribe to our Free apps, or where available, pay for our Pro versions.
As well as adding premium features, where available, this also removes advertising and significantly reduce the amount of data we collect from your use of our apps (see the full Policy).
In addition to Subscriptions your device also gives you control to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it.
Ultimately you can also choose to delete and stop using the app at which point any data collection will cease.
By using our apps, our website or contacting us you agree to the collection and use of certain data as described in this Policy.
We are the data controller, which means that we will determine the purposes for processing your personal data and the manner in which processing is carried out.
This Privacy Policy describes how we will use your personal data. If you have any queries on how we use your personal data, please contact us at
privacyteam@mapway.com
.
This Privacy Policy was last updated 12
th
May 2023.
We reserve the right to make changes to it and publish the latest version which shall then apply.
Information you share with us
We do not require you to directly provide any personal information to us to start using our services.
It is not necessary for you to have created an account, nor will we ever make your use of our apps public, other than occasionally quoting user reviews posted in app stores on our website or in other publicity.
Should you contact us directly (either via the app, website or a direct email) you will be providing your name, email address and (when contacting us from the app) an app ID.
We will keep the content of your message and contact information to enable us to respond to your request and feedback to our team, but for no other reason.
If using our myTrains service you will need to provide us with payment information, including your debit or credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code and billing address, in order to purchase train tickets.
We will never require that you provide payment information for any other services, all Subscriptions or the purchase of Pro versions of our apps is transacted via the appropriate app store and we never receive payment information about you from them.
Any carbon offset subscription you take out via our partner Furthr will be transacted by them and governed by their privacy policy (
https://furthr.earth/privacy-policy
).
Use of Shop & Save (where available) connects you with merchants through our trusted technology and transaction processing partner Kindred and is governed by their privacy policy (
https://event.kindred.co/privacy-policy
).
Additional information we receive about you – all users
Location information:
We require information about your current location to effectively offer you our services.
Subject to your settings, we may collect, use and store additional information about your location to operate or personalise our services such as nearest transit stops, transport disruption, etc.
You control whether we collect this data at all times or only when you are using the app, or even if we can collect this data at all.
If you choose not to share location, we will be unable to offer you our full level of intended service which relies on this data.
Cookies:
Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.
Analytic Data
:
We receive information when you interact with our apps and website, which we refer to as “Analytic Data”. For example, when you open the app we record this as a session so we can monitor which of our apps are being used most often, at what times of the day, etc; if the app crashes we log the screen you were viewing and other data such as if you have mobile reception to help us identify the cause of such crashes and fix them.
This information is collected by third-party SDKs (as identified later in this Policy) and we receive anonymised reports from this data to help us enhance our services.
Apple music services:
The Playlists feature in our Bus Times London app makes use of MusicKit on iOS 11 and above. This feature requires access to Apple Music, your music and video activity and your media library so that we can provide you with personalised playlists to listen to on your journey.
Granting this permission is necessary for the Playlists feature to work. We will never access your music for any other reason and will never access your non-music media (such as video or photos). In addition, we will never analyse or store your music preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time through your device settings.
Additional information we receive about you – certain users
The additional information we receive about you depends on whether you have purchased a Pro version or a Subscription.
If you have made these purchases, then this section does not apply to you.
Location information:
As well as offering our full service if you have not purchased our Pro or on of our Subscriptions we may share location data with other third-party partners (as identified in this Policy) for activities such as the personalisation of adverts so these may be more relevant and useful for you.
Links:
If you click on an ad in our apps, that advertiser may know that you came from a Mapway app, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach.
Advertisers and Other Ad Partners:
Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads within the app and outside of it. Our ad partners and affiliates collect information such as advertising IDs and location where you have granted permission. Our ad partners collect the data via SDKs and this is not shared with us.
Information we share and disclose
Payment information:
If using myTrains we share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.
Service providers:
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help us understand the use of our services, such as Flurry Analytics and Google Analytics. We may share your personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
Law, Harm, and the Public Interest:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data if we believe that it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platforms; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s request to disclose your personal data.
Change of Ownership:
I
n the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity.
Non-Personal Information:
We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of downloads, monthly active users or sessions, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.
Advertisers:
If you have not purchased a Pro version of the app or a Subscription then we may provide to third party advertising partners information about your activity on our app and your location. These partners may collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities to provide you contextual advertising based upon your interests and activity.
Our legal basis of processing data
We collect, use and share the data we have in the ways described above:
As necessary to deliver our Services to you;
As necessary to comply with our legal obligations;
As necessary for our (and others’) legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative, personalised and profitable service to our users and partners.
Managing your personal information with us
You control the personal data you share with us. You can access or rectify this data at any time. You can also stop using our apps.
Retention: When you give us any personal information, we will only hold this for as long as we need to perform the activities detailed in this Policy or have a valid reason to keep it.
We will also consider the type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements when considering retention.
We design our services so that we don’t hold your information any longer than we must.
EU, EFTA & UK:
If you are located in the UK, European Union or EFTA States, you can confidentially contact Mapway’s Privacy Team by emailing
privacyteam@mapway.com
. If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.
Your rights under GDPR are as follows:
You have the right to be informed about our processing of your personal data;
You have the right to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal data completed;
You have the right to object to us processing your personal data;
You have the right to have your personal data erased, otherwise known as the ‘right to be forgotten’;
You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, and information on how we process it, commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’;
You have the right to move, copy or transfer your personal data (‘data portability’); and
You have rights in relation to automated decision making, including profiling.
You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
It has enforcement powers and can investigate compliance with data protection laws.
More information about the Information Commissioner’s Office can be found on their website –
www.ico.org.uk
.
Personal Control:
There are the ways in which you control the sharing and use of your information and ultimately you can also stop using our services and any time and delete our app so that no data is collected:
Remove Ads: Subscribing will stop your device making requests for adverts and the sharing of your data with third parties for commercial purposes.
Limit Ad Tracking: You will be asked whether you will allow ad tracking.
Even if you allow this you can remove this authority at any time from within your device settings.
In doing so you will still receive adverts, but they will be less relevant to you (and so probably more of an annoyance) as less information is made available to the advertisers.
Analytics data: We use this data anonymously to help us improve and fix bugs within our apps.
You can remove this from the settings in your device.
Location data: We need this data to provide our full services.
You can limit this within the settings on your device.
Our Global Operations
To bring you our services, we operate globally. Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in the United Kingdom, and any other country where we operate. In some of the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of your country.
If we transfer personal data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we will ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws and contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the data.
Your privacy and protection are important to us, and we will not transfer your personal data until we are satisfied that your personal data will be protected.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be at
https://www.mapway.com/privacy-policy-permissions/
. If we make a change to this Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an in-app notification, instigating our full app on-boarding process or any other method we consider appropriate. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
