This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as “Policy”) outlines the terms and conditions on how the data subjects’ (hereinafter referred to as “Users” or “you”) personal or anonymous information is processed. Please read these terms and conditions carefully!
This Privacy Policy applies to the data collected by NNG Software Developing and Commercial Limited Liability Company (registered office: Szépvölgyi út 35-37., 1037 Budapest, Hungary, company registration number: 01-09-891838, EU VAT id: HU13357845, hereinafter referred to as “NNG”) in relation to the operation of the iGO Primo applications for iOS available in the App Store and for Android available in Google Play Store (hereinafter respectively referred to as “Application”).
In the context of this Privacy Policy:
Anonymous data: information that is not associated with or linked to your personal data; Anonymous data does not permit the identification of individual persons;
Unique Device Identifier: means an identification code randomly generated for each device.
While using the Application, we collect the following data that qualifies as personal data based on the Act CXII of 2011 on the Right of Informational Self-Determination and on Freedom of Information of Hungary („Data Protection Act”):

As you use the Application we collect the following location and route information sent by your device on which the Application is installed and activated:
GPS signals;
speed of the vehicle;
heading of the vehicle;
location of the vehicle.
The above data is collected by a backend service and gathered from connected devices which use NNG’s navigation software. The connected navigation device periodically sends GPS-based data to NNG’s server. The data is sent on-the-fly, therefore a continuous internet connection is required. If there is no internet connection (e.g. due to bad signal strength), the logs generated by the client device will be uploaded to NNG’s server once there is a connection, but only those pieces of data will be forwarded to the provider that are not older than 5 minutes.
We use this information to
improve the quality and enhance your experience with the Application;
to create aggregated and anonymous data;
to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, if required or requested and such request meets the applicable legal standards and procedures, as NNG may by obligated by mandatory law to disclose your personal data to certain authorities.
We use a randomly attributed Unique Device Identifier in connection with your location data and logs. Such identifiers are processed anonymously. We do not use this information to identify you personally.
NNG may use such anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user and the information cannot be linked back to you, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to map and service providers, partners and any other third parties.
