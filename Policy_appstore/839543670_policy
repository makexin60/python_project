Who are we?
We are MoreApp. This Privacy Policy governs all data processing activities for which we are to be regarded as the Data Controller.

We are located at Stationsplein 45, 3013 AK Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Sharing of personal data with third parties
We do not share your personal data with third parties, except for carrying out our services. These third parties are in fact data processors. We work, for example, with Google Cloud Platform (Eemshaven, The Netherlands) to host MoreApp's Services, MongoDB Atlas (Eemshaven, The Netherlands) for data storage and to back up MoreApp's Services, MailChimp (AWS USA) for sending our newsletter and with Hubspot (AWS EU) to provide customer support. When you choose to use a third-party plug-in, you permit data to be shared between MoreApp's Services and the plug-in vendor. We also use Posthog to analyse product usage and improve our product. We do this only to carry out our agreement with you, for our legitimate interest or when we have your consent. These parties process personal data in accordance with the instructions of MoreApp. A legal obligation or similar disclosure, or a merger or sale of MoreApp to another company can also be a reason for us to share personal data with third parties.

We recommend you to read the privacy statements of these parties before using their services.
