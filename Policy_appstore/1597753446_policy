The difference between live chat and
help desk software

With a complete customer service solution like Zendesk, businesses can reap the benefits of a help desk and live chat software in one solution.
The main differences between live chat and chatbots include:
Interaction type:
Autonomous support from humans or AI agents versus script- or algorithm-based interactions.
Use case:
Customer support and complex interactions versus FAQs, lead generation, and basic inquiries.
The best live chat software for small businesses depends on your company’s specific needs. Zendesk live chat software is great for small businesses looking to integrate live chat, ticket automation, and multichannel support with advanced reporting features.
Live chat is a must-have for any business that serves customers, including small businesses, enterprise companies, and e-commerce stores. From education to troubleshooting, live chat is an indispensable part of modern
customer service
.
Investing in live chat support software makes sense for companies looking to provide customers with instant support in a more convenient (and cost-effective) way than simply using the phone. It can also be an excellent tool for lead generation. For example, an e-commerce company may want to consider investing in a
Shopify live chat app
to provide exceptional service at all stages of the customer journey.
There are several types of live chat software, including:
Standalone live chat software:
Software that focuses solely on live chat, often resulting in siloed or lost customer conversations.
Omnichannel live chat software:
Platforms that integrate multiple communication channels—such as live chat, email, phone, and social media—into a unified interface.
Chat widget:
Solutions that let customers message businesses via a chat window on a website or mobile app.
Messaging apps:
Software that allows customers to contact companies through channels like SMS, social media, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, and Messenger.
AI agents:
AI-powered bots that can autonomously handle basic and complex customer inquiries.
When choosing between different types of live chat software, consider your business’s specific needs.
