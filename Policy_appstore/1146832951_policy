So that we can provide you with a great user experience, we may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need. This is how we decide which adverts and content may be relevant for you. We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising and providing you with personalized content. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:
How to opt- out of a personalised website or app experience
Opting out for App Users:
If you do not want your experience on the App to be tailored to you based on your viewing habits on the App, go to your profile->settings and slide the ‚ÄòPersonalisation‚Äô to ‚ÄòOff‚Äô. If you change your mind and would like to receive a personalised experience, you can simply slide the ‚ÄòPersonalisation‚Äô button back to ‚ÄòOn‚Äô.
Opting out for Website users who are logged into their Culture Trip Account:
If you do not want your experience on the Website to be tailored to you based on your viewing habits on the Website, go to profile->settings and uncheck the ‚ÄòPersonalisation‚Äô checkbox. If you change your mind and would like to receive a personalised experience, you can simply re-check the box.
Opting out for Website users who do not have a Culture Trip Account:
If you do not want your experience on the Website to be tailored to you based on your viewing habits on the Website, please
click here
to opt out from personalisation. If you change your mind and would like to receive a personalised experience, you can simply
click here
. If you click the link to opt-out, we will place a ‚Äòdo not track‚Äô cookie on your browser. Please note that if you delete all cookies on your browser, or if you use a different browser to access the Website you will have to click this link again in order to stop us personalising your experience on our Website.
Tracking andadvertising:
We use products offered by Google and Facebook in order to show you adverts which we think are likely to be relevant to you. If you do not want to receive personalized advertising, and marketing please follow the instructions in the paragraph below. If you want to change the personalized advertisement settings you can use the ads settings to manage the Google ads and opt out of interest-based ads by following
THESE
instructions. Furthermore, you can elect to reset your mobile device Advertising ID to clear any associated ad targeting or data collection activities. You may do so at the following links:
Android
/
IOS
Facebook may also collect information about how you use our website, such as which pages you visit through first-party cookies, to enable both Facebook and Culture Trip to provide more relevant messages to you across Facebook. You can opt out of Facebook first-party cookies by updating your
Facebook Privacy Settings
and control the information Facebook uses to show you advertisements by managing your
Ads Preferences
Do Not Track:
For California residents, ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù (DNT) has been promoted by US regulatory authorities for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism that allows internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Culture Trip currently does not respond to DNT browser signals.
Marketing emails:
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by
contacting us
at any time.

Internal Third Parties as set out in the
Glossary
.
External Third Parties as set out in the
Glossary
.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party data processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
üåç International transfers
We share your personal data within the Culture Trip Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the United Kingdom and European Economic Area (
UK and EEA
). Some of our external third parties are based outside the UK and EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK and EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK and EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded. This could be achieved using one of the following ways:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. For further details, see
European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries
.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see
European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries
.
In some specific cases we may use certain service providers that use
Binding Corporate Rules which have been specifically approved by the European Commission.
.
Please
Contact us
if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK and EEA.
üîí Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

They will have access to your information as is necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. We use external third parties such as social networks through the use of social plugins (e.g. share/like buttons). We use external third party service providers to help us with providing travel services to you, these may include travel service suppliers such as sales/reservation system providers, software companies, hotel suppliers, experience providers. This is not an exhaustive list.
Your legal rights
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a ‚Äúdata subject access request‚Äù). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data‚Äôs accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
