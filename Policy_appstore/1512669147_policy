How we use face data
Face information is only used on the device itself and only during video generation, and is only stored at the time of video generation. Its lifetime does not exceed a few minutes and depends on how long it takes to generate a video on your phone. The face information is only needed to generate a video. After that, the App knows nothing about the user's face. We do not share face information with third parties.
