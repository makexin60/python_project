1. Kyocera Document Solutions Global Internet Privacy Policy
This Global Internet Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Kyocera Document Solutions protects your privacy when it collects personal information on Kyocera Document Solutions Internet sites. As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.
This Policy applies, in general, to all internet sites operated by Kyocera Document Solutions hereafter “Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site”).
2. Web Site Privacy Statements
Although this Policy applies to all Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Sites generally, each Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site has a different purpose and features. If additional or different disclosures are required with respect to a specific Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site, those disclosures will be provided on the site itself or in a separate web site privacy statement (“Web Site Privacy Statement”) posted on that site. Each individual disclosure or Web Site Privacy Statement supplements and amends this Policy, but only with respect to the Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site on which it is posted.
3. Limitations on the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
To the extent required by applicable law, whenever Kyocera Document Solutions collects personal information on a KYOCERA Document Solutions Internet Site, Kyocera Document Solutions will:
provide timely and appropriate notice to you about Kyocera Document Solutions' data practices;
collect your personal information only for specific, limited purposes. The information Kyocera Document Solutions collects will be relevant, adequate and not excessive for the purposes for which it is collected;
process your personal information in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected or to which you have subsequently consented;
take commercially reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is reliable for its intended use and accurate, complete, and, where necessary, updated;
allow you to stop receiving marketing or unsubscribe and take appropriate measures, by contract or otherwise, to provide adequate protection for personal information that is disclosed to a third party.
4. Information Collected on Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Sites and How It May Be Used
When you access and use a Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site, there are 3 ways Kyocera Document Solutions may collect information about you:
I. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser
Kyocera Document Solutions collects information that is sent to it automatically by your web browser. The information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh® or Windows®) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer® ). The information Kyocera Document Solutions receives depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. Kyocera Document Solutions uses the information to create statistics to help it improve its sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our Internet visitors.
II. Information Collected By Placing a “Cookie” On Your Computer
Kyocera Document Solutions may obtain information about you by installing a “tag” on your computer's hard drive. This tag is known as a “cookie.”
Some of the Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Sites use “session cookies.” A session cookie is used to tag your computer with a computer-generated, unique identifier when you access a Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site. A session cookie does not identify you personally and expires after you close your browser. Kyocera Document Solutions uses session cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use its sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. Kyocera Document Solutions analyzes this information (known as “clickstream data”) in statistical form to better understand visitors' interests and needs in order to improve the content and functionality of Kyocera Document Solutions sites.
Some Kyocera Document Solutions Internet sites also use “persistent cookies.” These cookies do not expire when you close your browser; they stay on your computer until you delete them. By assigning your computer a unique identifier, Kyocera Document Solutions is able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where these choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be provided by Kyocera Document Solutions automatically, saving you time and effort. For example, after you make a purchase, if you decide to make another purchase, your shipping address will have been retained and will only need to be confirmed.
Where legally required, you may customize your cookie settings provided on a Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site via the cookie banner and settings. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit a Kyocera Document Solutions Internet Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the site if your browser rejects Kyocera Document Solutions' cookies.
We use the following cookie.
