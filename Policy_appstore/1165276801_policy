WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Personal information you disclose to us
In Short:
We collect personal information that you provide to us.
We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
Personal Information Provided by You:
The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use.
We may not encrypt the following information and may keep them on our server:
Name
Address
Email Address
Phone Number
Application Data
Subscription Information
We encrypt the following information on your own devices and do not keep them on our server:
Sensitive Data (Files and Folders you choose to encrypt using our products)
Photos
Videos
Audio
Documents
Wallets
Notes
To Dos
Bookmarks
Contacts
We do not store or transmit the following information to our server to remain secure and compliant:
Sensitive Data (Files and Folders you choose to encrypt using our products)
Passwords
Payment Information
Sensitive Data:
Your sensitive data (texts, files and folders you provide to encrypt with our product(s)) is never saved on our server. One exception is Secure Backup service in Folder Lock 7. But even in this case, your data is fully encrypted with AES 256-bit Encryption which is saved on our server. However, apart from this service, there is no product we have that stores or transmits your data to us in any shape or form. The most you can find is that such information is either stored on your own device(s) or your own cloud service like your own Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive accounts in encrypted format that you use for backup of your own data, but it never reaches us.
Passwords:
We do not store or transmit your passwords or keys to our server. Such information is saved only on your own device(s) in some cases and in cases you’re using one of our encryption product as opposed to locking product, we don’t save it on your own device as well. In both cases however, your passwords or keys are never stored or transmitted to our server.
Payment Information:
Payment information is collected by E-commerce companies like Stripe, BMTMicro, Bluesnap, Mycommerce, Trialpay, Paypal, Google, Microsoft, Apple etc. This information never reaches us. We may however store your last 4 digits of Credit Card and Expiry Date that do reach us using APIs provided by some of these services. This is to provide you with subscription related information, activation of your subscription and upgrade/update related features in some products. However, we do not get your full Credit Card Number or CVV/CCV etc. This makes us fully PCI compliant.
Application Data:
If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:
Device Access:
We may request access or permission to certain features from your device, including your device’s camera, contacts, microphone, sensors, reminders, storage, calendar, social media accounts, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.
Device Data:
We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, Computer ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, processor name/type, hard disk name/type, motherboard name/type, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, MAC address and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our application(s), we may also collect information about the phone network associated with your device, your device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and information about the features of our application(s) you accessed.
This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short:
We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.
We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:
To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.

We may process your information to better understand how to provide marketing and promotional campaigns that are most relevant to you.
To save or protect an individual’s vital interest.
We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short:
We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click

Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users
Support our marketing activities
Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience

If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.
For investigations and fraud detection and prevention.
For business transactions provided certain conditions are met.
If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim.
For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.
If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse.
If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province.
If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records.
If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced.
If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.
If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
