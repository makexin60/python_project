When I first tried Speakly, I noticed how beautiful the app was, and was then surprised a second time to see how effective the listening activities are. I use it for French and Spanish. With just a few minutes each day, I’m already seeing improvements!

Speakly is the first app I've seen that actually encourages real and effective engagement with the new language, rather than just urging you to complete some tasks. Unlike other apps, I feel that if someone were to challenge themselves to a period of consistent use of Speakly, they'd be ready for engagement with the real language through podcasts and TV and the like. It feels like it's been developed by language learners, for language learners.
