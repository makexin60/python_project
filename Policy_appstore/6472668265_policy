As used in this Privacy Policy, "Reen Game Player", "we", "us", or "our" refer to Reen Game Player and all of its subsidiaries.
Your privacy is important to Reen Game Player. We designed our Privacy Policy to cover how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information. Please familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
Our Privacy Policy applies only to the collection; use and disclosure of personal information that you may decide to provide to us in your use of our applications for mobile platforms or devices and our web applications accessible on third party social networking services. Any and all of our Reen Game Player Applications, are referred to herein as our "Services".
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services and on the Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update the "Last Updated Date" in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.
Please visit this page periodically to remain up-to-date as to any Privacy Policy changes. Take a moment now to read the following to learn about our information collection practices that may impact you as a registered user with full access to our Services or a non-registered user of our Services (each a " Reen Game Player User "). For information regarding the collection and use of Personal Information (defined below) from children under 14 years old, see the Section below, entitled "Our Policy Toward Children".
We Collect Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information
In the course of using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, and email address (" Personal Information "). We will collect, use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
We also collect non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not permit direct association with you or any specific individual (" Non-Identifying Information "). Non-Identifying Information is aggregated and used to help improve our Services and Third Party Mobile Applications (defined below) by providing a better way to understand the Reen Game Player User experience with the level of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific Applications or specific Third-Party Mobile Applications. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose Non-Identifying Information for any purpose; details provided in this Privacy Policy about what Non-Identifying Information we collect currently, and how we use, transfer and disclose such Non-Identifying Information concern only how such information is collected and used today.
Both Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information may be used alone or in the aggregate with information collected from other Reen Game Player Users. Our primary objective in collecting any Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information is to provide you with a superior and personally relevant user experience.
How we use your Personal Information
Your Personal Information may be used, for instance:
•  To help us to develop, deliver, and improve our Services and advertising;
•  To recommend products of interest directly to you;
•  For market research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community of Reen Game Player Users;
◦    For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with announcements, and promotional materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a "Promotion") via our Services.
▪    If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "Changing or Removing Information" below for further information.)
•  To allow us to keep you posted regarding our latest Service announcements, software updates, and upcoming events;
•  To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or other Service-specific policies. Because this information is important to your interactions with Reen Game Player, you may not opt out of receiving these communications;
•  To audit and analyse data to improve our Services and customer communications.
How we use your Personal Information
One of the instances when we collect your Personal Information is in connection with your registration on our Services.
If you are a Reen Game Player User, you can register either via an Reen Game Player Application or via a third-party application utilizing our Services (" Third Party Mobile Application ") that was designed for mobile telephones or other mobile devices by a third-party publisher (" Third Party Publisher ").
In connection with registration of Reen Game Player Users on our Services, we collect Personal Information which may include your email address, as well as information on mobile device type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier ("Device ID"), Internet Protocol ("IP") address and geo location, as applicable. We use your Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand your use of our Services, or the Third Party Mobile Application that you may choose to access through our Services.
Related to this information collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to other Third-Party Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks or other ad fulfillment metrics.

You may also be asked explicitly to provide Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information anytime that you are in contact with Reen Game Player company. If your Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information is shared with our affiliates, such sharing will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Cookies & Other Technologies
As is standard practice, we use "cookies" to help us study traffic patterns and understand the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that we send to your computer’s or mobile device's browser. Other types of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection with our Services are only used to obtain browser-specific information. For example, we do not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies we use can reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular, how much time Reen Game Player Users are spending there, and how they are interacting with the content on such pages.
You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of our Services due to limited functionality.
Some of our Services, including email messaging, use "click-through URLs" linked to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics, Services usability and other measures of Reen Game Player User engagement.
We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively " Pixel Tags ") in connection with our Services and to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
When you use our Services or Third-Party Mobile Applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser or the applicable Service or Third-Party Mobile Application sends ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date stamp, clickstream data and other statistics. We use this information to monitor, analyze and understand trends, for technical administration of Services and Third-Party Mobile Applications, and to gather demographic information about our Reen Game Player User base as a whole.

2. Cookies
We, our vendors and service providers use cookies and other similar technologies (e.g. pixels, web beacons etc.) (collectively, “
Cookies
”) to enhance your experience using the Game. We will obtain your consent to the use of Cookies where required under applicable law.
(a) What is a Cookie?
Cookies are used to collect data, including personal data, from you. Cookies are small files which, when placed on your device, enable the Game to provide certain features and functionality. Web beacons are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize Cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar data from your computer or device.
Cookies are stored on your browser by website or apps that you visit. When you return to that website or app (or visit websites or apps that use the same cookies) these platforms recognize the Cookies and your browsing device.
b) Categories of Cookies
Cookies do many different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Game before or whether you are a new player. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
There are different categories of Cookies, including:
· First-party Cookies: First-party Cookies are small amounts of text which are served by us directly to your device.
· Third-party Cookies: Third-party Cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party Cookies for essential, functionality, analytic and performance, targeting or advertising and social media purposes.
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some Cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other Cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the platform to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
c) What types of Cookies do we use and how do we use them?
The types of Cookies and similar technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the Game can be classified into one of five categories, namely 'essential Game Cookies', 'functionality Cookies', 'analytics and performance Cookies', 'targeting and advertising Cookies', and 'social media Cookies'. Cookies do a lot of different tasks to ensure you enjoy your use of the Game, for example, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit, to help you navigate between pages more efficiently and to make sure the adverts you see on our Game are relevant to you and your interests. We have set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the Cookies we and third parties set in the following table.
Cookies that are necessary for essential purposes
These Cookies are essential to provide you with the Game and to use some of its features, such as to enable you to log in. Without these Cookies, we would not be able to provide you with a secure log in account. We use Cookies to uniquely identify you. Each time you log in to the Game, a Cookie containing a unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These Cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Game and to process your online transactions and requests.
Functionality Cookies
Functionality Cookies record information you have entered or choices you have made. These Cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Game after logging in so that we can personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preference. These Cookies can also be used to remember settings you have applied. These Cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Game, we can enable you to start the Game from where you left off.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
We use analytics/performance Cookies to analyze how you use the Game, including your level in the Game, measure any errors that occur and test different design ideas. The information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Game to provide services in accordance with these activities. These Cookies do not collect information that individually identifies you and all information these Cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous. We also use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Game (with your consent if required under applicable law).
Targeting or Advertising Cookies
Analytics: As you use the Game, you will notice that it features advertising. We allow third party companies, including advertising companies, to place Cookies in the Game to track the performance of our advertisements (with your consent if required under applicable law). As an example, these Cookies remember which users have used the Game. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information but it may be associated with personal information after they receive it.
Marketing: We may also (with your consent, where required under applicable law) contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from the Game, from third party websites and apps. Ad networks follow your online activities and collect information through automated means (such as through the use of Cookies, again, with your consent, if required under applicable law). Ad networks use this information, mainly to serve adverts about products and services that are likely to interest you. We may also partner with third parties to provide certain features in the Game or display advertising based on your web browsing activity. We may also use information from one device to help personalize your experience on another device. For advertising purposes, we may collect your Google Ad ID, Android Ad ID or (where applicable) your IDFA (IDFA stake the place of Cookies in mobile advertising delivered to iOS devices).
Social Media Cookies
Third parties whose applications are connected to the Game by you will set their own Cookies in order to customize their applications for you. Because of how Cookies work, we cannot access these Cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in Cookies used by us. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, the third party will be able to link information about you with your actions via Cookies.

Because each browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your browser. Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable certain types of Cookies. For example, due to differences in how browsers and mobile apps function, you may need to take different steps to opt out of Cookies used for targeted advertising in a browser and to opt out of targeted advertising for a mobile application, which you may control through your device settings or mobile app permissions. In addition, your opt-out selection is specific to the particular browser or device that you are using when you opt out, so you may need to opt-out separately for each browser or device. If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete Cookies, some of the functionality of the Game may no longer be available to you.
• You may opt out of receiving advertising and/or marketing communications by following the instructions in such communications or by using options provided in the game settings.
• Your mobile device may include a feature that allows you to opt out of some types of targeted advertising (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS and “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android).
• Some browsers transmit “do-not-track" signals to websites.

We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
• If you have registered for an account, you may access, review, and update certain personal data that you have provided to us by logging into your account and using available features and functionalities.
• If you want to remove your contacts stored by us, follow the instructions provided in the game to request that we remove them from our systems. If you need to enter a password to allow us to access your address book, we will not store that password.

You are also responsible for keeping your personal data safe. Also, you are responsible for keeping your account details (if any) confidential.
We will, from time to time, include links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Because company cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal data by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as company. Please check these policies before you submit any data to these websites.
8. How long do we keep your personal data
We retain your data for as long as it is necessary to provide you with the service so that we can fulfill our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the data involved. However, there are occasions where we are likely to keep this data for longer in accordance with our legal obligations or where it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
