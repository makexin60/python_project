This Privacy Policy describes how and when Parity Zone
collects, uses,
and shares your information when you use android applications offered by

.
Parity Zone
receives your information through our
mobile applications. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply
information from, the information provided by you is utilized by Parity Zone
in its own capacity and is not shared with anyone.
Information Collection and Use
Contact Information:
The only contact information that we get from you is your
device id that helps you send relevant promotional information to you. Other than
that, our applications do not use any kind of user sensitive information from you.
Moreover, the information collected by us is not shared at any platform or with any
third party.
Location Information:
At this point of time,

not collect any information related to your location. If in future we do get your
location, you will be notified with regards to granting location information and the
same change will be made to the privacy policy as well.
Cookies :
When you use any of our applications, we may keep cookies as a means
of gathering information with regards to your use of our applications. Such
information is gathered via Admob SDK that collects your information and helps
in showing you ads pertinent to your use of the applications.
Log Data:
We do not collect your log data directly. It is Google with its services
that fetches and keeps your log data that is only used by us for analysis purposes
only. Google with its services in our applications shares your Log Data information
with us. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type,
operating system, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search
terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our
applications.
Parity Zone

uses a variety of third-party services to help
provide our services, such as Firebase Analytics and Firebase Cloud Messenger to
provide you information about our latest applications and to better understand your
use of our applications. These third-parties may collect information sent by your
browser or mobile device, such as cookies, your IP address, or device ID.
Information Sharing
We do not share any of the information collected by us with any other business or
any other third party for either personal or commercial use.
Our Policy Towards Children
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. As stated above, we rely on
Google Services as a means of getting user information, therefore, any of the
services that we offer to our users are above the age of 13 and Google’s age
parameters help us ensure that.
Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We
provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we
process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to
authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order
to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we
endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no
security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
Opt-out Rights
If you do not feel comfortable with the use of our applications under the given
privacy policy, then you have the right of opting out any time by uninstalling the
application from your phone. None of your information will be kept or
disseminated further.
