We are the Data Controller and a Data Processor under the terms of the GDPR for Dr Falk Pharma UK Ltd.
2. How we collect information
Personal Information
You typically give this information to us via this Site and/or by correspondence or telephone and/or in face to face discussions with us.
Some examples of interactions are when you: request educational literature; register for and/or attend a meeting; subscribe to the Newsletter; discuss medicinal products with us; are in receipt of a transfer of value such as sponsorship, grant, support etc.
System information collected from IP addresses
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your organisation’s local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online.
We also collect data by use of
Cookies
(see our
Cookies
notice).
3. What information we hold
The main category of personal data we collect is contact information of healthcare professionals. We directly collect personally identifiable information, i.e., information from which you can be identified, such as name, address, telephone number and/or e-mail address. We may also need to ask for other specific information, for example, if you are attending a meeting we organise we may ask if you have any dietary requirements. This is to accommodate your requirements at meetings.
When we sponsor you to attend a medical meeting, personal information may be passed to a travel agency acting on our behalf. When the meeting is abroad, they may require information from your passport so that they can arrange your travel. The data will be processed by all parties according to the requirements of the Regulation.
When we offer you a Transfer of Value, such as sponsorship, support, grant or donation, we collect financial data from the related activities for which you received the Transfers of Value.
When we hold virtual meetings, occasionally we may wish to record the content. Depending on how the meeting is held this may include the recording of audio or video of the attendees. Parts of that recording could count as personal data according to data protection laws. Personal data in recordings would include your name, images of you (i.e., webcam footage) and any opinions you contribute and anything you say about yourself. You will not be requested to give consent for the recording as that is not the lawful basis. If you do not want to be recorded you could mute your microphone, turn off your webcam or choose not to contribute to the meeting. Your name may still be visible in the recording.
We do not request any information categorised as sensitive, for example, on race, politics or religion.
In cases where you send sensitive data, for example, about your health or about an adverse drug reaction, it is anonymised before being processed. If necessary, for regulatory requirements, any identifying data are separately and securely stored, otherwise they will be deleted following anonymisation. The anonymised data may be included in the EMA’s Eudravigilance database and/or in the MHRA’s safety database and will be included in our safety database, which is located in the EU and managed by a third party.
Dr Falk automatically collects (where available) information about your browser type and operating system, websites you visited before and after visiting the Site, standard server log information and IP Address (see below). This information is aggregated to gather data such as the total number of visits to the Site, the number of visitors to each page of the Site and the domain names of our visitors’ internet service providers.
In addition, we hold data collected by
Cookies
.
This Site is not intended for, or designed to attract, children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this Site from visitors in that age group.
4. The legal basis we rely on
To be in compliance with the GDPR we have reviewed the data we collect and the reasons and legal basis for doing so. The GDPR defines different reasons a company may collect and process personal data. The data that Dr Falk collects will be in compliance with one of the reasons listed:
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent – e.g., when you ask us to arrange travel on your behalf. When collecting your personal data, we will always make clear to you which data are necessary in connection with a particular service.
Contractual obligations
In some instances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations. For example, if you place an order with us for literature, we need your address details to deliver your order and we may need to pass your details to a courier.
Legitimate interest
The lawful basis for processing some personal data is legitimate interest. This applies when the data processing is not required by law but is of a clear benefit to the organisation or the individual, there is limited privacy impact on you as the individual and we think you would reasonably expect us to use the personal data in the way that we wish to. Specific examples of where we use legitimate interest are in recording virtual meetings and in declaring Transfers of Value.
Legal obligation
With regard to special categories of personal data (sensitive data) we are required to collect and process anonymised health data for the reasons of public interest in ensuring high standards of medicinal products (Article 9.2.i of the GDPR).
5. Why we hold the information
We only request and collect the information needed for each situation.
We collect your personal details so that we can offer you therapeutic updates and/or invitations to events/opportunities for networking.
We collect your IP address, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use the Site so that we may improve it and the services we offer.  We may also share this aggregated information with other companies within the Dr Falk Pharma group and with other third parties
.
We also may use IP addresses to identify users of the Site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s terms of use or to protect our service, Site or other users.
Dr Falk is an associate member of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) and as such are required to comply with the ABPI’s Code of Practice for the Pharmaceutical Industry (the ‘Code’).  We collect information about the Transfers of Value that you have received from us so that we can comply with our obligations under the Code and in particular the requirement that ‘companies must document and publicly disclose annually certain transfers of value made directly or indirectly to health professionals, other relevant decision makers… located in Europe’.  We collect your personal data so that we can either share it with the ABPI (in the case of UK data); who will validate and collate the data for publication on Disclosure UK, the publicly accessible database managed by the ABPI that shows transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies that are signatories to the Code.  The ABPI’s privacy notice in relation to Disclosure UK can be found
here
.  For the data we collect from Ireland, since we have no affiliate or website in Ireland, we publish Transfers of Value on our own website.
6. What we may do with the information
We may:
Store your email in our email system.
File your hard-copy communication and/or sensitive information in a secure place.

7. Sharing the information
Dr Falk will not share, sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties other than as stated in this Notice.  Sometimes selected third parties are used to provide Dr Falk with support services in connection with the Site and other company business processes and such parties may, from time to time, have access to your information to enable them to provide those services to Dr Falk.  An example of this would be a third party that provides IT support.
All companies providing support services are required by Dr Falk to meet the same standards of data protection as Dr Falk and are prohibited from using the information for their own purposes.  In particular, we do not allow our service providers to use personally identifiable information disclosed by us for their own marketing activities.
We may share your personal data relating to Transfers of Value with the ABPI, for the purpose of complying with the Code.  The ABPI will validate and publish your personal data on the Disclosure UK website.
We may disclose personally identifiable information to any member of our group which means our holding company and its subsidiaries and/or in the following circumstances:
when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with Dr Falk’s rights, property or operations, other users of this Site and/or their rights, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; and/or
when we believe the law requires it, or we are under a duty to disclose or share your data to comply with a legal obligation or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation; and/or
in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a product line or division, an investment in our business, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy in which case we may disclose personal data to the prospective seller, buyer or investor; and/or
We may share the data with any government agency entitled to this information by law.
Personally identifiable information collected on the Site may be transferred, stored and processed in compliance with Chapter V of the Regulation, ‘Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations’.
Links to other websites
This Site may from time to time provide links to other websites as a service to our users.  This Privacy Notice does not apply to those websites.  If you choose to enter such a linked site you agree that Dr Falk is not responsible for the availability of such websites and does not review or endorse and shall not be liable, directly or indirectly, for (i) how these websites treat your personally identifiable information, (ii) the content of such websites, including (without limitation) any advertising, products, goods or other materials or services available from such websites and (iii) the use that others make of these websites.
Please ensure that you check the legal and privacy statement posted on each website you link to before entering any personally identifiable information.
8. How long we keep the information
We retain the data we collect for as long as needed to carry out the task for which it was collected, for example, data to fulfil a request for literature will only be kept until the order is fulfilled, after which it will be securely deleted.  In some cases, we may need to keep it longer, for example, if we are in an on-going dialogue with you for educational and/or marketing purposes.  In other cases, there may be legal/regulatory reasons to keep the data for much longer, for example the data to meet the needs of the ABPI Disclosure requirements.
9. Protection of the information
Dr Falk is committed to using commercially reasonable means to ensure that your personally identifiable information is protected appropriately, according to the sensitivity of the information. Dr Falk uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personally identifiable information you provide to Dr Falk on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of the personally identifiable information during transmission to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, once we have received your information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
The database and email system are held on a secure server, regularly backed up and hosted in the UK.
