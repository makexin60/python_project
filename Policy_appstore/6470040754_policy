Privacy Policy
Valid from: May 16, 2024
We Do Not Collect "Personal Data"
When information is not collected, it cannot be stolen, requested, leaked, or abused. Protecting your personal data is the best way to safeguard your online privacy.
How We Define "Personal Data"
Our definition of personal data is based on the data protection laws and regulations of the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These are widely considered the strongest data protection measures globally. We consider any information about you or your behavior that can be traced back to you as personal data.
Information We Do Not Collect
So let's be clear:
• We do not collect the text you enter in the app
• We do not record your hardware information
• We do not capture your IP address
• We do not use tracking or identification cookies
We Do Not Record Your Image Queries
When you enter a query, your request is automatically stripped of unnecessary metadata, including your IP address and other identifying information. We send the anonymized search query to Prodia.com and return the search results to you. We do not log your image queries.
We Do Not Analyze Anything
We do not measure overall traffic numbers or the number of image queries you have. Therefore, we cannot analyze your usage.
What Happens to Your Data Beyond *Image!nator* Image Queries
Once your image queries are answered and you close the app, all your entered data is deleted. The results from *Image!nator* are delivered by Prodia.com Services in complete privacy.
We Do Not Share or Sell Your Contact Information
If you contact us via email, we use the provided contact information to respond to you.
Third-Party Services
• Prodia.com: We may also use the Prodia.com API to answer your query. Therefore, we send your query anonymously and without identifying you as a user to the Prodia.com API. The entered data is only used on the server to answer the query and is immediately discarded. It is not stored. For more information, refer to Prodia.com's privacy policy (https://beta.Prodia.com.com/docs/usage-policies).
How We Respond to Data Requests by Authorities
You cannot request what we do not have. Any request must be made by German judicial authorities. We will only do so if legally obligated. However, we are unlikely to receive requests from governments to disclose user data simply because we do not have any.
We Will Never Comply with a Voluntary Surveillance Program
Fortunately, we are based in the EU, where we have strict laws protecting your right to privacy. European governments cannot legally compel service providers like *Image!nator* to implement a blanket surveillance program.
Additional Clause on the Processing of Face Data
Our app includes functionalities that may capture facial data to provide specific services. We uphold with the staunchest resolve the protection of your privacy and security. Thus, we assure you that no facial data is stored or retained thereafter. Any facial data collected is exclusively utilized for the necessary processing activities and immediately eradicated post-completion without remnants.
Explicit Statement on Non-Retention of Facial Data
Our commitment is staunch: we retain no facial data following the use of our app. Once the service in question is completed—be it image editing, effect application or similar—all relevant data are irretrievably purged, consistent with our comprehensive privacy policies and stringent legal requirements.
Changes to Our Privacy Practices
Should there be any changes to our methods of data collection, processing or storage—especially concerning facial data—we will communicate these transparently in our privacy policy and promptly notify you.
Accountability and Contact for Privacy Concerns
We warmly invite you to reach out directly to us if you harbor concerns about how your data is handled. It's our obligation to take your concern seriously and do everything within our power to ensure your protection and address your needs.
*Image!nator* Complies with the GDPR
