Sensitive data is only processed by Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. It is securely stored in databases to which these companies themselves don't have access to.
Disclosure of data to other users
It's important to remember that you, as a user, are also responsible for your own personal data. If you are careless with your own personal data, it can not only have consequences for yourself, but also for the personal data of other users. Therefore, we recommend that you do not give your phone to others when you are signed in to Breeze. In addition, it is also prohibited to share screenshots of profiles, as we are not responsible for the information that is distributed in that way.
11. International Transfers
Some of our external third parties are based outside the UK and EEA, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK and EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK and EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded by implementing at least one of the following safeguards:
The country to which personal data is being transferred has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
We use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which provide personal data with the same protection it has in the UK and Europe.
By agreeing to our Services, you give consent for the processing of your data outside the EEA.
12. Data Security
We have put in place reasonable security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where legally required. If you still feel that your data is not well protected or if there are indications of abuse, please contact
our Privacy Manager
.
Since your Account and personal data can be accessed via your mobile phone and can be recovered via your email, it is important that you take appropriate measures to secure them. Let us know immediately if any of these has been compromised.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data during transmission to our servers. Therefore, we do not assume any responsibility or liability for breaches of security, damage to your device, or unauthorized use of your information.
13. Data Retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including satisfying legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation with respect to our relationship with you.
When determining the appropriate retention period, we consider:
The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data.
The potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure.
The purposes for processing your personal data and whether we can achieve these purposes through other means.
Applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.
In this respect, we apply the following retention periods:
Personal data of App Users | These data are stored until the end of our contractual relationship or when consent is no longer valid. Data stored at third parties may be stored shorter based on the last engagement.
Personal data of Contractors | These data are stored for a maximum period of 24 months after our last contact.
Personal data of Job Applicants | We store these Personal Data for a maximum of 4 weeks after the application process, unless the Job Applicant has given us permission to store the Personal Data for (up to) 1 year.
Personal data of Leads | These data are stored as long as necessary to determine whether we enter into an agreement with a potential client and for a maximum period of 24 months after our last contact.
Personal data of website visitors | Please see our Cookie Statement below.
If you delete your Account, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that your account is no longer visible to other users in the App. We are not responsible for lost information, content, or photos as a result of your decision to delete your data. To prevent abuse (of Breeze), we may, at our discretion, retain (anonymised) information in certain situations, such as after a breach of our
General Terms
and
User Terms
, or other laws or regulations, even after your Account has been deleted.
Retention of your personal data by others
Please note that after you have deleted data from your profile or Account, copies or (part of) your data may be available to others, to the extent that this data has been previously shared with them. For example, it is possible that other users have copied or stored certain personal data (for example, through a screenshot). This is beyond our control, and we therefore take no responsibility or liability for this.
14. Automated Decision Making and Profiling
We use profiling, and to some extent automated decision making within the meaning of art. 22 GDPR to provide our dating services.
Automated decision making
With respect to
automated decision making
, we use large-language models to flag profiles for review on whether they adhere to our
User Guidelines
and to approve or reject profiles from our App. This is to ensure the safe, transparent and fair dating environment that our User Guidelines prescribe. Since this automated decision-making is necessary for entering into the contract between App users and Breeze, it is not prohibited by law.
How the automated decision making works
The data categories used include photos, pseudonymized name and the anonymized bios of the User. These categories are used as input for the large-language model and are considered relevant by Breeze as they include the first input the User provides in their profile. Based on this input, Breeze assesses whether the User is eligible for an Account on the App. This information is tested alongside Breeze’s User Guidelines that clearly describe what content is and is not allowed on the App.
To ensure a fair and objective approval process, Breeze uses AI-based decision-making instead of a fully manual review. This approach is necessary due to the volume of User profiles that Breeze needs to assess daily. Additionally, Breeze has implemented measures to mitigate risks associated with automated processing:
Human Oversight: We conduct periodic sampling of both approved and rejected profiles to ensure accuracy and fairness. In the initial deployment phase, human reviewers validate AI decisions and fine-tune input parameters where needed.
Data Minimization: Only photos and anonymized bios are used. Names are pseudonymized before being processed.
Data Accuracy & Fairness: We continuously test AI output and perform human checks to improve decision accuracy and avoid biased results.
Data Retention: Breeze adheres to strict data retention policies
No Personal Data is used for Training Purposes: Breeze deploys a Business account, meaning that the large-language model operator does not use the personal data for its own (training) purposes.
User rights and appeal mechanisms
Right to Object: As Breeze relies on legitimate interests for profile verification, you have the right to object to automated decision-making. If you wish to exercise this right, you can request a fully manual review by contacting us in the App or via email to our DPO.
Appeal Mechanism: If your profile is rejected, you may contest the decision by contacting objections@breeze.social. You will be able to request a human review, provide additional context, and express your point of view. A link to this appeals process will be available when a decision is communicated to you, with clear response timelines and a designated contact point for inquiries.
Profiling, not qualifying as automated decision making
Breeze further conducts the following profiling activities:
use our Cupid service to
suggest relevant profiles
based on User profiles and like behavior. The suggestions are partly based on the logic of "similar Users have also liked this profile" and "Users with this characteristic like Users with a certain characteristic". You can influence the selection process by choosing where you want to date, as well as the ages and sexualities of the Users you want to date;
use your User preferences and residential area, which are linked to your Account, to
determine the date location and deal
. We only select overlapping deals and choose the location in a way that gives preference to the User who lives there. This may mean that you sometimes have to travel further if your place of residence does not have an overlapping city.
Here
you can find more information on how our recommendation systems works.
In respect of the above, we only take personal data into account that you directly provide and we actively try to avoid any discriminatory decision-making. In case you feel disadvantaged by any automated decision-making or profiling activities, please contact us in the App or email
our DPO
.
15. Your Legal Rights within the EU and UK
Under the GDPR, you have the right to:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and check its lawful processing.
Request correction
of the personal data we hold about you. Users can always view and adjust or delete your personal information through the App.
Request erasure
of your personal data where there is no good reason for us to process it. This right also applies if you object to processing, we processed your data unlawfully, or we must erase your data to comply with local law.
Object to processing
of your personal data, especially when we rely on legitimate interest or use your data for direct marketing purposes.
Request restriction
of processing under specific scenarios, such as when you contest the accuracy of the data or need it for legal claims.
Request data transfer
of your personal data to you or a third party in a structured, machine-readable format.
Withdraw consent
at any time if processing relies on consent. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing before consent withdrawal.
Make a complaint
with our Privacy Manager or DPO if you believe that we are processing your data unlawfully. You also have the right to file a complaint with the relevant regulator.
Please note that feedback provided by other users about your match or interaction is not considered your personal data under the GDPR. This feedback is anonymized and pertains to the overall quality of the match or the app’s functionality, rather than you personally. Additionally, this feedback is provided confidentially by the other user and is not shared with you to maintain the integrity and candidness of the feedback process.
Any general queries that you have can be addressed to
our DPO
and specific questions on your data to our
Privacy Manager
.
We aim to respond to all legitimate requests as soon as possible but in any case within one month. Complex requests may take longer to resolve, and we will keep you updated. To prevent your data from falling into the wrong hands, we will ask you a number of verification questions after receiving your request.
In some cases, we may limit your rights, for example in the context of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offenses, such as fraud.
16. Third-Party Links
This website or our App may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Clicking on these links or enabling connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

17. Amendments to this Statement
We may revise this Statement from time to time. The most recent version can be found on our website:

If we make changes that are, in our sole discretion, substantive, then we will notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your Account or by posting a message in the App. By continuing to use the App after these changes have become effective, you agree to the modified Statement.
