At Eastertide, every  page in the Universalis apps has a special Alleluia button. Anyone who presses it will hear Alleluias spoken by users of Universalis around the world.
If you have contributed a recorded Alleluia for other people to hear (or are thinking of doing so), read on.
When your voice will be heard
Every time the Alleluia button is pressed, the app chooses three Alleluias to play. It chooses them at random. Thus if we have 300 Alleluias in our files, everyone has a 1-in-100 chance of hearing your voice.
What people will know about you
Nothing.
No information is put into the audio files – only the sound of your voice.
What we know about you
If you send us your voice by email, we will know your email address. If you send us your voice through iMessage or WhatsApp, we will know your phone number.
How we use this information
We do not use this information for anything at all.
How to be forgotten
If you change your mind and don’t want your voice included after all, email us at
universalis@universalis.com
and let us know.
Money
We don’t charge anyone for hearing the Alleluias, so we don’t pay you for using your voice.
