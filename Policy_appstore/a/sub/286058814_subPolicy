Yahoo Privacy Center
Yahoo is now part of Oath, a digital and mobile media company with more than 50
brands
globally, and a member of the
Verizon family of companies
. The way we handle your information hasn‚Äôt changed, so Yahoo‚Äôs Privacy Policy still governs when you are on a Yahoo site, using a Yahoo app or interacting with our products, services or technologies. We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Yahoo account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Center -- take a look around. You'll learn how Yahoo treats your personal information, along with ways to control your preferences and settings. As always, Yahoo is committed to gaining your trust.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
Yahoo takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
The federal government and technology industry have developed
practical tips
to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.
How Yahoo Uses Your Personal Information
This policy covers how Yahoo treats personal information that Yahoo collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Yahoo products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This privacy policy only applies to Yahoo
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some companies that Yahoo has acquired have their own, preexisting privacy policies which may be viewed on our
affiliates page
.
Data Transfer
Your personal information may be transferred to countries other than your own to process and store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and to provide you with products and services.  Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. Yahoo may process personal information related to individuals in the EU and may transfer that information from the EU through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our products and services, you consent to us transferring your data to these countries. We are committed to ensuring your information is protected and apply safeguards in accordance with applicable law.
For more information, please visit our
Data Transfer
page.
Information Collection & Use
General

Yahoo products or services
, when you visit Yahoo pages or the pages of certain Yahoo partners, and when you enter
promotions or sweepstakes
. Yahoo may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. When you register with Yahoo and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

Children
With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account. Visit
Children's Privacy & Family Accounts

Information Sharing & Disclosure
Yahoo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Yahoo communicate with you about offers from Yahoo and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. See

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (such as

), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Yahoo is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Yahoo will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Yahoo displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria‚Äîfor example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
Yahoo does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
Yahoo advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
