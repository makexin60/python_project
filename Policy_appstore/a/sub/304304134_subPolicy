Third parties that process your personal data are contractually bound by Data Processing Agreements which ensure that these parties adhere to the standards that we describe in this Privacy Policy.
Do we participate in interest-based advertising programs?
Yes. We may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you access or use some of our Sites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising”). We also allow third-party companies to place their own cookies on your browser when you visit our Sites, so that they can collect information, which may include personal information, about your online activities over time and across different sites and serve customized advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. You will find a detailed description of what personal data we transmit to such third parties in the section “How and with whom do we share and disclose information we collect from you?” above.
These third party companies may participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance. As part of this program, targeted advertisements may be delivered with an
AdChoices icon
to help you understand how data about you is being used and provide you with the ability to opt-out of that behaviorally targeted advertising. You can click on an
AdChoices icon
to learn more about your choices with respect to interest-based advertising. From a mobile device, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s
AppChoices website
to download a free app that allows you to set preferences for data collection and use across mobile apps. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative by visiting the
opt-out page
on their website.
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that allows you to tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Only certain of our Sites are currently set up to respond to these signals, however, for Sites not set up to respond to a “do not track” preference, you have other choices and options as described in this Privacy Policy regarding our different types of advertising and electronic marketing-related communications.
We use NextRoll, Inc. (formerly, AdRoll, Inc.) to serve targeted advertisements. For California consumers, please see the CCPA disclosures set forth in Section 13 of NextRoll’s
Service Privacy Notice
.
What other technologies do we use?
Clear gifs
Some or our Sites employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage our content and newsletters by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and in E-mails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based E-mails to let us know which E-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Google360 (Google Analytics)
Some of our Sites and the FontExplorer X Pro desktop client,  use “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of such Site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the
Google Analytics Terms of Use
(as amended for government websites) and the
Google Privacy Policy

a browser-add-on to deactivate Google Analytics
.

Heap uses cookies, to help the website analyze how users use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website is transmitted to and stored by Heap on servers in the United States of America. In the event IP anonymization is activated on such website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Heap within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). A full IP address will be transmitted to a Heap Server in the USA and shortened there only on an exceptional basis. Heap uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of a website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services to website operators relating to website activity and Internet usage. You may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software; however, we must advise you that in this case, you might not be able to use all functions a Site to the full extent. You may prevent Heap from recording the data generated by the cookie and pertaining to your use of our Sites (including your IP address), or processing these data by disabling cookies in your browser.

Clarity uses cookies and other technologies to collect data about our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device’s IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers, browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our Sites.

We will inform you if your data was deleted or if it cannot be deleted.
How can you opt-out?
If you no longer want to receive communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving our communications by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any electronic communication you receive from us, or, if you created an online account when you registered to receive our marketing-related communications, you may log-in to your account on the applicable Site and make changes to your communication preferences.

If you no longer want to receive printed communications from us, please contact us directly using the methods listed in the “How can you contact us?” section of this Privacy Policy.

However, please note that even if you opt-out from receiving certain communications, we may still need to send you communications about your orders, customer service inquiries, promotions participation and other matters. We also may keep information we have collected about you for our records, our research and other purposes.
Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that party, you will need to contact that party to opt-out of those communications. This process may be outlined in that third party’s privacy policy.
What rights do I have if I am a California consumer?
In addition to the rights set out in this Privacy Policy, California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), provides for additional rights to California consumers. Your rights as a California consumer are summarized below.

How do we keep your information secure?
We and certain third parties we employ to collect or store your information use commercially reasonable organizational, technical and administrative means intended to protect collected, provided, stored and/or transmitted information, including your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of Internet or electronic transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error-free, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Some of our Sites may contain links or references to other websites or services that are managed by third parties.

We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every service, application, or website you visit or interact with.
