1. General Terms of Use
This Steam Games Privacy Policy is designated to provide you guidance regarding Retro Dreamer's privacy policies and principles with respect to collecting, using and disclosing personal information regarding Users who are using our Steam Games.
Note:  The Steam Games are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children under 13 years of age or a minor under any applicable law  ("Kid"). Retro Dreamer does not knowingly collect or process Personal Information from Kids. We encourage parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience. If you are a legal guardian of a Kid and you believe that your Kid has provided us Personal Information, please contact us at contact@retrodreamer.com and we will delete such information from our servers.
Retro Dreamer does not collect or share personal information from Users of the Steam Games. The Steam platform, however, is created and maintained by Valve Corporation, which is not affiliated with and/or controlled by Retro Dreamer.
Your consent and use of the Steam Games is subject to Steam's terms of use and privacy policies, which are located at:
http://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/
You should ensure that you read Steam's terms of use and privacy policies to understand how they collect and use your Personal Information and in order to understand the methods for changing the privacy or sharing settings on such services.
If you do not agree to the practices described in Steam's terms of use, you should not play the Steam Games.
Retro Dreamer may access certain non-identifiable and anonymous information from Users of our Steam Games ("Non-personal Data"). Non-personal Data which may be collected may include, for example, aggregate data, technical information, statistical information and behavioral information, and may contain, among other things, device type, type and version of operating system, network provider, browser identifiers, type of browser, screen resolution, session information, SDK version, API key, time spent playing, browser cookies, levels achieved, application version, in-app purchases, network status, local and time zone, and the activities of the User in the Steam Games. This Non-personal Data may be collected, stored and/or processed by Steam and/or third party providers of certain products and services associated with Steam ("Third Party(ies)"). Retro Dreamer is not aware of the identity of the User from whom Non-personal Data has been collected.
2. Collection of User Information
Non-personal Data may be collected through your use of the Steam Games. In other words, when you are using the Steam Games, Retro Dreamer and Third Parties are aware of it and may gather and collect, including without limitation, through such Third Parties' SDK embedded in our Steam Games, the information relating to such usage. In addition, local Non-personal Data may also be stored on your device via generally accepted industry technologies used within the Steam Games, such as "cookies" and local storage. Please review Steam's terms of use and privacy policies to understand Steam may collect and use "cookies" and similar technologies and to understand the methods for changing your privacy or sharing settings on the Steam platform.
Additionally, Retro Dreamer may collect personal information through direct interaction, communication, or social media, including without limitations, leaderboards and mailing lists.
3. Sharing Information with Third Parties
Retro Dreamer may make Non-Personal Data and personal information available to third parties under the following circumstances:
(1) with your express consent;
(2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law;
(3) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets.
Your consent will not be required for disclosure in the foregoing circumstances, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
4. Using Game Center Features and Social Features
Our Steam Games permit using certain game center features and may include social features. The game center and social features are operated on third party application platforms ("Platforms") or allow for social integration with certain third party social networks ("Social Networks"). The Platforms and Social Networks, including Steam, are open communities where you can consent to your gameplay information including without limitation your user name, social media profile picture, game activity/statistics, multiplayer match information (including player-to-player communications), and leaderboard rankings being publicly posted and shared within the Steam Games, on the Platform or Social Networks, and/or third-party games or web pages.
Retro Dreamer does not collect or share information that we know directly and clearly identifies you (such as your real name or email address). The Platforms and Social Networks, however, are created and maintained by third parties who are not affiliated with and/or controlled by Retro Dreamer. Your consent and use of game center and/or social features is subject to the applicable third party Social Network's or Platform's terms of use and privacy policies, as identified below.

You hereby understand and agree that when you share content via Social Networks or Platforms that your content may become public and any person may re-post-it.
5. User Generated Modifications
Certain Steam Games available on Steam allow you and other users to develop, upload and distribute user generated modifications to the Steam Games ("User Mods"), via the Steam Workshop. Your use of the Steam Workshop and/or creation of User Mods is subject to the applicable Steam terms of use, as set forth in the Steam Subscriber Agreement, which can be found at the following link:
http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement
When you upload or submit User Mods to Steam Games, you convey to Retro Dreamer the right for Retro Dreamer and its affiliates to communicate, distribute, host, publicly display, market, reproduce, store and use the User Mods. Retro Dreamer may modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display User Mods that we believe violate the law or which are uploaded for any purpose not reasonably intended for the Steam Games (within Retro Dreamer's independent discretion).  However, Retro Dreamer has no obligation to monitor or review any User Mods uploaded or submitted to the Steam Games. By uploading or submitting User Mods to any Steam Games, you are assuming all risk of liability from any legal violation or claim for damages arising from the User Mods. Retro Dreamer is not responsible for the content of any User Mods and denies all liability associated with the User Mods. Your use of User Mods through any Steam Games is at your own risk.
