Google Cloud Privacy
                      Notice
Effective Date: February 6, 2025
This Google Cloud Privacy Notice describes how we collect
                      and process your personal information in relation
                      to
Google Workspace (including Google Workspace for Education)
,
Google Cloud Platform
,
Google Cloud Marketplace
,
Cloud Identity
(when sold separately),
Implementation Services
and
Google Cloud Training
(together,
                      “Cloud Services”).
We offer Cloud Services to our customers either directly
                      or via our authorized partners. Where we refer to our
                      customers in this notice, we also mean our partners and
                      their customers.
If European Union (EU), UK or Swiss data protection law
                      applies to the processing of Service Data relating to you,
                      you can review the
                      ‘
European Privacy Standards and GDPR
’
                      section below to learn more about your rights and Google’s
                      compliance with these laws.
If your organization has entered into our
Google Workspace for Education Service Data Addendum
,
                      please review the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
together with this notice.
Google processes Customer Data, Partner Data and Service
                      Data to provide Cloud Services. This Privacy Notice
                      applies solely to Service Data and
does
                        not
apply to Customer Data or Partner Data. We
                      explain what we mean by “Service Data” below.
Customer Data and Partner Data are defined in the
                      agreement(s) with our customers covering Cloud Services
                      and represent the data that you and our customers provide
                      for processing in Cloud Services. For more information
                      about how we process Customer Data and Partner Data, see
                      our
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (Customers)
and
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (Partners)
.
Service Data is the personal information Google collects
                      or generates during the provision and administration of
                      the Cloud Services and related technical support,
                      excluding any Customer Data and Partner Data.
Service Data consists of:
Account information.
We collect the data you or
                        your organization provide when creating an account for
                        Cloud Services or entering into a contract with us
                        (username, names, contact details and job titles).
Cloud payments and
                          transactions.
We keep reasonable
                        business records of charges, payments, and billing
                        details and issues.
Cloud settings and configurations.
We
                        record your configuration and settings, including
                        resource identifiers and attributes, and service and
                        security settings for data and other resources.
Technical and operational details of your
                          usage of Cloud Services.
We collect
                        information about usage, operational status, software
                        errors and crash reports, authentication details,
                        quality and performance metrics, and other technical
                        details necessary for us to operate and maintain Cloud
                        Services and related software. This information includes
                        device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens,
                        and IP addresses.
Your direct communications.
We keep
                        records of your communications and interactions with us
                        and our partners (for example, when you provide
                        feedback, ask questions or seek technical support).
Google processes Service Data for the following purposes:
Provide Cloud Services you request.
We use Service Data primarily to deliver the Cloud
                        Services that you and our customers request. This
                        includes processing Service Data as needed to conduct
                        checks before extending credit to certain customers, to
                        bill for the Cloud Services used, to ensure those
                        services are delivered or working as intended, to detect
                        and avoid outages or other technical problems, and to
                        secure your data and services.
Make recommendations to optimize use of Cloud
                          Services.
We use Service Data to provide you
                        and our customers with recommendations (for example,
                        suggesting ways to better secure your account or data,
                        reduce service charges or improve performance, or
                        optimize your configurations), and providing information
                        about new or related products and features. We also
                        evaluate your responses to our recommendations and other
                        feedback (if you choose to provide it).
Maintain and improve Cloud Services.
We evaluate Service Data to help us improve the
                        performance and functionality of Cloud Services. As we
                        improve Cloud Services for you, this will improve them
                        for our customers, and vice versa.
Provide and improve other services you
                          request.
We use Service Data to deliver and
                        improve other services that you and our customers
                        request, including Google or third-party services that
                        are enabled via the Cloud Services, administrative
                        consoles, application programming interfaces (APIs) or
                        command line interfaces (CLIs), or the Google
                        Workspace Marketplace.
Assist you.
We use Service Data to
                        provide technical support for Cloud Services that you
                        and our customers request, and to assess whether we have
                        met your needs. We also use Service Data to improve our
                        technical support, inform you and our customers about
                        updates to Cloud Services and send other notifications
                        relating to Cloud Services.
Protect you, our users,
customers,
the public, and Google.
We use Service Data
                        to detect, prevent and respond to fraud, abuse, security
                        risks, and technical issues that could harm you, other
                        users, our customers, the public, or Google. This
                        helps make our services safer, more reliable, and more
                        secure.
Comply with legal obligations.
We use
                        Service Data to comply with our legal obligations (for
                        example, where we’re responding to legal process or an
                        enforceable governmental request, or meeting our
                        financial record-keeping obligations).
To achieve these processing purposes, we use algorithms
                      to recognize patterns in Service Data, manual review of
                      Service Data (such as when you interact directly with our
                      billing or support teams), aggregation or anonymization of
                      Service Data to eliminate personal information, and
                      combination of Service Data with information from other
                      Google products and services. We also use Service Data for
                      internal reporting and analysis of applicable product and
                      business operations.
Please note, if your organization has entered into our
Google Workspace for Education Service Data Addendum
:
your organization will process Service Data collected
                        or generated from Google Workspace for Education, as a
                        controller, for purposes it is required to disclose to
                        you separately; and
Google’s processing purposes listed above will not
                        apply to you. The purposes that apply to you are
                        described in the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
.
                        Please visit that link to learn more.
We maintain data centers around the world, and provide
                      Google Workspace (including Google Workspace for
                      Education) and Cloud Identity (when sold separately) from
these locations
,
                      and Google Cloud Platform from
these locations
.
Service Data may be processed on servers located outside
                      of the country where our users and customers are located
                      because Service Data is typically processed by centralized
                      or regionalized operations like billing, support, and
                      security.
Regardless of where Service Data is processed, we apply
                      the same protections described in this Privacy Notice.
                      When transferring Service Data outside of the European
                      Economic Area, the UK or Switzerland, we comply with
                      certain
legal frameworks
.
We build Cloud Services with strong security features to
                      protect your data. The insights we gain from providing our
                      services help us detect and automatically block security
                      threats from ever reaching you.
We work hard to protect the Service Data we hold from
                      unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure,
                      or destruction, including by:
Encrypting Service Data at rest and while in transit
                        between our facilities.
Regularly reviewing our Service Data collection,
                        storage, and processing practices, including our
                        physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized
                        access to our systems; and
Restricting access to Service Data to Google
                        employees, contractors, and agents who need it in order
                        to process Service Data for us. Anyone with this access
                        is subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                        obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
                        fail to meet these obligations.
We instruct our affiliates to process Service Data for
                      the purposes listed under
                      "
Why We Process Service Data
"
                      above, in compliance with this Privacy Notice and
                      appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We do not share Service Data with companies,
                      organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in
                      the following cases:
When you procure third-party services
We share Service Data outside
                      of Google when you or our customer choose(s) to procure a
                      third-party service through Google Cloud Platform, the
                      Google Cloud Platform Marketplace or the Google Workspace
                      Marketplace, or use a third-party application that
                      requests access to your Service Data.
With your consent
We’ll share Service Data
                      outside of Google where we have obtained your consent.
With your administrators and authorized resellers
When you use Cloud Services,
                      your administrator and resellers authorized to manage your
                      or your organization’s account will have access to certain
                      Service Data. For example, they may be able to:
View account and billing information, activity and
                            statistics
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Access your account information in order to
                            satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process,
                            or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your
                            information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We do not sell your Service
                      Data to any third parties.
We share Service Data with
                      trusted third party providers to process it for us as we
                      instruct them and in compliance with this Privacy Notice
                      and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. In
                      particular, we share Service Data with our third party
                      providers when you request technical support services (we
                      share the information you provide in the support ticket,
                      and those providers may communicate with you or your
                      administrator in that ticket, including providing updates
                      and closing the ticket) and professional services (we
                      share your contact details to enable communication and
                      collaboration).
For legal reasons
We share Service Data outside
                      of Google when we have a good-faith belief that access to,
                      or disclosure that Service Data is reasonably necessary
                      to:
Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal
                            process, or enforceable governmental request. We
                            share information about the number and type of
                            requests we receive from governments in
                            our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable agreements, including
                            investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
                            security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or
                            safety of Google, our customers, users, and the
                            public as required or permitted by law.
If Google is involved in a
                      reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets,
                      we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of Service
                      Data and give affected users notice before Service Data
                      becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Your organization may allow you to access and export your
                      data in order to back it up or transfer it to a service
                      outside of Google. Some Google Cloud Services enable you
                      to directly access and download the data you have stored
                      in the services. As further described in our
Google Workspace Data Subject Requests Guide
,
                      you or your organization may use various tools to access,
                      control, and export your data.
You and your organization’s administrator can access
                      several types of Service Data directly from Google Cloud,
                      including your account information, billing contact
                      information, payment and transaction information, as well
                      as product and communication settings and configurations.
If you’re otherwise unable to access your Service Data,
                      you can always request it
here
.
We retain Service Data for different periods of time
                      depending on the type of data, how we use it, and how you
                      configure your settings. When we no longer need Service
                      Data, we delete or anonymize it.
For each type of Service Data and processing operation,
                      we set retention timeframes based on the purposes for
                      which we process it, and ensure that the Service Data is
                      kept for no longer than necessary. We retain most types of
                      Service Data for a set period of up to 180 days (the exact
                      number depends on the specific type of data). However,
                      some Service Data may be kept for longer periods where
                      there is a business need. We generally have longer
                      retention periods (which can be over a year) for Service
                      Data that is kept for the following purposes:
Security, fraud and abuse prevention.
We retain
                        Service Data when it is necessary to protect against
                        fraudulent attempts to gain access to user accounts, or
                        to investigate violations of applicable Cloud Services
                        agreements. Usually, the Service Data retained where
                        there is reason to suspect fraud or abuse would include
                        device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens,
                        and IP addresses, as well as log data about usage of the
                        Cloud Services.
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements.
We
                        retain Service Data when required by an enforceable
                        legal process, such as when Google receives a lawful
                        subpoena.
Complying with tax, accounting or financial requirements.
When Google processes a payment for you, or when you
                        make a payment to Google, we retain Service Data about
                        those transactions (including billing information),
                        typically for a minimum of five years, as required for
                        tax or accounting purposes, or to comply with applicable
                        financial regulations.
At the end of the applicable retention period, we follow
                      detailed protocols to make sure that the Service Data is
                      securely and completely deleted from our active systems
                      (the servers Google uses to run applications and store
                      data) or retained only in anonymized form. After
                      completion of these steps, copies of Service Data will
                      remain for a limited period in our encrypted backup
                      systems (which we maintain to protect Service Data from
                      accidental or malicious deletion and for outage and
                      disaster recovery purposes), before being overwritten by
                      new backup copies.
Your Google Account is your connection to all Google
                      products and services, not just Cloud Services. When you
                      choose to use Google products and services outside of
                      Cloud Services,
                      the
Google Privacy Policy
describes how your personal information (including your
                      Google Account profile information) is collected and used.
                      You and your administrator can control which other Google
                      services you may use while logged into a Google Account
                      managed by your organization.
If you interact with Cloud Services using a Google
                      Account managed by your organization, then your personal
                      information may be subject to your organization’s privacy
                      policies and processes, and you should direct privacy
                      inquiries to your organization.
Exercising your data protection rights
If European Union (EU), UK or Swiss data protection law
                      applies to the processing of Service Data relating to you,
                      you have certain rights, including the rights to access,
                      correct, delete and export your Service Data, and to
                      object to or request that we restrict processing of your
                      Service Data.
Google Cloud EMEA Ltd will be the data controller
                      responsible for your Service Data. However, where our
                      customer has entered into an agreement covering Cloud
                      Services with a different Google affiliate, that affiliate
                      will be the data controller responsible for processing
                      your Service Data in connection with billing for the Cloud
                      Services only.
If you want to exercise your data protection rights with
                      regard to Service Data we process in accordance with this
                      Privacy Notice, and you are not able to do so via the
                      tools available to you or your organization’s
                      administrator, you can contact Google via our
Privacy Help Center
.
You can always contact your local data protection
                      authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under
                      local law.

Google Workspace for Education Service Data Addendum
,
                      please review the
Supplemental Google Cloud Privacy Notice
for information about the legal grounds we rely on when
                      processing your Service Data collected or generated from
                      Google Workspace for Education.
Additional information (Switzerland)
If Swiss data protection law applies to the processing of
                      your Service Data, the following additional information is
                      relevant.
Please see the section titled ‘Where Service Data is
                      Stored’ (above) for information on where we and our
                      affiliates process Service Data. We also disclose your
                      Service Data to service providers, partners and other
                      recipients (see the section titled ‘How We Share Service
                      Data’) that are located or process information in any
                      country in the world.
We comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the
                      transfer of information as set out in our
Legal Frameworks for Data Transfers
page. We may also transfer your information to a third
                      country based on an exception provided for by the Swiss
                      Federal Data Protection Act.
An exception may apply in the event of legal proceedings
                      abroad, in cases of overriding public interest or if the
                      performance of a contract with you or in your interest
                      requires disclosure, if you have consented, if the
                      information has been made generally available by you and
                      you have not objected to the processing, or the disclosure
                      is necessary in order to protect the life or the physical
                      integrity of you or a third party and we can't get consent
                      within a reasonable period of time, or the information
                      originates from a register provided for by Swiss law which
                      is accessible to the public or to persons with a
                      legitimate interest, provided that the legal conditions
                      for the consultation of such register has been met in the
                      specific case.
If Brazilian data protection law applies to the
                      processing of Service Data, you have certain rights,
                      including the rights to access, correct, delete or export
                      your Service Data, as well as to object to or request that
                      we restrict processing of Service Data. You also have the

                          contract with you
We may process your information where necessary for
                          us to enter into a contract with you or to comply with

                          interests and those of third parties while applying
                          appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This
                          means that we process your information in the
                          interests of providing Cloud Services you request;

                          customers, and the public, as required or permitted by
                          law.

This Privacy Notice is designed to help you understand
                      how Google handles Service Data:
We explain the categories of Service Data Google
                          collects and the sources of that Service Data in
Service Data We Collect
.

                          Google does not sell your Service Data to any third
                          parties. Google also does not “share” your Service
                          Data as that term is defined in the California
                          Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
We explain how Google retains Service Data in
Retention and Deletion of Service Data
.
                          We maintain policies and technical measures to avoid
                          re-identifying that information.
U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request
                      information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses
                      Service Data. And they give you the right to access your
                      Service Data, sometimes in a portable format;
                      correct Service Data; and to request that Google delete
                      that Service Data. They also provide the right to not be
                      discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights.
We provide the information and tools described in
Access to Service Data
so you can exercise these rights. When you use them, we’ll
                      validate your request by verifying your identity (for
                      example, by confirming that you’re signed in to your
                      Google Account).
If you have questions or requests related to your rights
                      under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized
                      agent) can also
contact Google
.
                      And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you
                      can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our
                      email.
Some U.S. state privacy laws require a description of
                      Service Data practices using specific categories. This
                      table uses these categories to organize the information in
                      this Privacy Notice.

                                strategy.
Protecting against security threats,
                                  abuse, and illegal
                                  activity.
Google uses and may
                                disclose Service Data to detect, prevent and
                                respond to fraud, abuse, security risks, and for
                                protecting against other malicious, deceptive,
                                fraudulent, or illegal activity. For example, to
                                protect our services, Google may receive or
                                disclose information about IP addresses that
                                malicious actors have compromised.
Auditing and measurement.
Google uses Service Data for analytics and
                                measurement to understand how our services are
                                used, and to provide you and our customers with
                                recommendations and tips. We may disclose
                                non-personally identifiable information publicly
                                and with partners, including for auditing
                                purposes.
Maintaining our services.
Google uses Service Data to provide Cloud
                                Services and related technical support, and
                                other services you request, and ensure they are
                                working as intended, such as tracking outages or
                                troubleshooting bugs and other issues that you
                                report to us.
Product development.
Google
                                uses Service Data to improve Cloud Services and

                                products, features and technologies that benefit
                                our users and customers.
Use of service
                                  providers.
Google shares Service

                                on our behalf, in compliance with this Privacy
                                Notice and other appropriate confidentiality and
                                security measures. For example, we may rely on
                                service providers to help provide technical
                                support.

                                your Service Data.
With your consent. We’ll disclose Service Data
                                outside of Google when we have obtained your

                                account will have access to certain Service
                                Data.
For external processing.
We disclose
                                Service Data with trusted third party providers
                                to process it for us as we instruct them and in
                                compliance with this Privacy Notice and

                                measures. In particular, we disclose Service
                                Data with our third party providers when you
                                request technical support services (we use the

                                details to enable communication and
                                collaboration).
For legal reasons.
We disclose Service
                                Data outside of Google when we have a good-faith
                                belief that access to disclosure of that Service
                                Data is reasonably necessary to:
Comply with applicable law, regulation,
                                    legal process, or enforceable governmental
                                    request. We share information about the

                      (vii) to comply with legal obligations, each as further
                      described

Retention period
and deletion
of
personal information.
We retain Service Data only for as long
                      as necessary to fulfill the purposes of collection and use described above.
                      For each type of data and operation, we set retention timeframes based on the
                      purpose for its collection, and ensure it is kept for no
                      longer than necessary.
If the retention period expires or you request deletion,
                      Google will faithfully endeavor to delete or anonymize such Service
                      Data unless there is a legal obligation that requires
                      processing or another lawful basis for retaining the
                      Service Data. When we receive a request to delete Service
                      Data, the retention period of the archive copy expires,
                      and then Google's archiving system has a mechanism to
                      overwrite the expired data.
We retain most types of Service Data for a set period of
                      up to 180 days (the exact number depends on the specific
                      type of data). However, we generally have longer
                      retention periods (which can be over a year) for Service
                      Data that is kept for (i) Security, fraud and abuse
                      prevention, (ii) complying with legal or regulatory
                      requirements including the Communications Secrets
                      Protection Act. We also have retention periods of a
                      minimum of five years for Service Data about payments and
                      billing information for complying with tax,
                      accounting or financial requirements, each as further
                      described

Measures undertaken to protect retained personal information.
Establishment of general policy
Google establishes and publishes this
Privacy Notice
outlining our general policy relating to Service Data.
Establishment of internal policy relating to handling of personal data
Google establishes internal policies about handling
                      measures and persons in charge and their responsibility
                      etc. with regard to the acquisition, utilization, records,
                      provision, deletion etc. of personal data.
Internal organization as security control action
Google has large security and privacy teams responsible
                      for developing, implementing, and reviewing internal
                      personal data handling processes. Google employees are
                      trained to report suspected incidents involving personal
                      data, which may be done through various channels such as
                      through dedicated email addresses or digital platforms. A
                      dedicated team assesses reported incidents, and as
                      appropriate a coordinated team is assigned to manage the
                      overall incident, including liaising with Legal and the
                      product team as part of the investigation and response.
                      The team on-call for an incident is assigned on a daily
                      rotation. Incident responses may follow either a standard
                      or an expedited route, depending on the severity and
                      priority assigned to the incident.
Personnel measures as security control action
Google conducts periodical training for its employees
                      about matters to consider when handling personal data.
Physical measures as security control action
Google takes measures to prevent unauthorized persons
                      from accessing personal data in any situation and to
                      prevent theft or loss of devices and electronic media for
                      handling personal data.
Technical measures as security control action

                      undertaken to secure, retain and delete Service
                      Data
Research of external environment
Data protection laws vary among countries, with some
                      providing more protection than others. Google has
                      established a personal information protection system to
                      ensure your information is accorded protections equivalent
                      to APPI, as described in the
Privacy Notice
.
                      Regardless of where your information is processed, Google
                      applies the same personal information protection
                      measures globally. We also comply with certain legal
                      frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the
                      European frameworks. For more detail, please see
Data transfer frameworks

.
                      There may be cases where Google entrusts the processing of
                      information to subprocessors or its subsidiaries or
                      affiliates. With regard to the location of Google’s

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We
                      will not make any significant changes without notifying
                      you in advance by posting a prominent notice on this page

Does Google know my location?
Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See
How precise is my location?
)
When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are.
See
How you can manage your location
How can I turn location on and off?
When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that you’re searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your device’s IP address. For more, see
How does Google know where I am?
To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device.
If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that you’re at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search.
How precise is my location?
Your general area
When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that you’re searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city.
A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesn’t identify you, helping to protect your privacy.
Your precise location
If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like “ice cream near me” or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store.
Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address.
How does Google know my location?
Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are.
IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area you’re in because of your IP address. Your device’s IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet.
Learn more
If you give a Google app or site permission to use your device’s location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings.
Learn more
Google can estimate the general area you’re in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, it’s likely that you want to see results in Mumbai.
Learn more
If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are.
Learn more
Who can see my location?
It’s up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services.
Check if you’re sharing your location
Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time.

Sharing on Google
What can other people see when I share on Google?
Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs?
Does Google ever share my info with others?
What can other people see when I share on Google?
What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share:
Sharing publicly
If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps.
Sharing privately
If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person you’re sending them to in addition to what you’re sharing.
Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in
Google Drive
, or albums in
Google Photos
, people may have continued access as you add new content.
Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs?
You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use.
Don’t forget that when you share, it’s possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google.
You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesn’t delete copies that you’ve already shared.
Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust.
Does Google ever share my personal info with others?
We don’t share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when we’re legally required to.
If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information.
Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
When you give us permission
For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See
How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services
With domain administrators
, as described above.
For external processing
, We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to:
Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

What data does Google collect about me?
When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in
Why does Google collect data?
.
With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you don’t want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See
How can I decide what Google saves?
What is data?
Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account.
Your personal information includes two types of things:
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password.
You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos.
We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience.
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
We process your location, such as when you’re using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the
Location
section.
Why does Google collect data?
We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data.
For example, Google Maps can help you get to where you’re going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places).
Provide our services
We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results.
Maintain & improve our services
Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests.
Measure performance
We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used
Communicate with you
We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud
How does Google use data to personalize things?
“Personalization” is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example:
Recommendations for videos you may like
Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see
Security Checkup
)
We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages.
Does Google personalize the ads I see?
We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we don’t personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off.
We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if you’re looking at a page of results for “new shoes,” you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page you’re looking at.

How can I decide what Google saves to my account?
As you use a Google service, like Photos, there are settings that let you decide things like whether you want to back up and sync your photos.
There are also settings that help personalize your experience across Google services. Two key ones are Web & App Activity and YouTube History.
When these controls are on:
Information about your activity on Google services is saved to your Google Account and
Saved information is used to personalize your Google experience
Saves your activity on Google sites and apps, like Search and Maps, and includes associated info like location. It also saves synced Chrome history and activity from sites, apps, and devices that use Google services.
Your activity is used to give you faster searches, better recommendations, and more personalized experiences in Maps, Search, and other Google services.
Saves the videos you watch and the things you search for when you use YouTube.
Your YouTube History is used to personalize your YouTube experience and other apps, like your search results.
How do I delete My Activity data?
You can delete data saved in your Google Account. Data you choose to permanently delete gets
removed
from our systems. We follow a careful process to make sure this data is completely removed from our servers or kept only in a form that can’t be associated with you.
Visit
My Activity
