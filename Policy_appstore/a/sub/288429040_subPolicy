With other organisations for safety and security
We may also share personal data in order to protect the security or integrity of our Services (e.g. sharing examples of security or safety threats with other companies facing similar threats), or the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, Visitors, and others.
How you can control your data
You can access, correct, rectify, delete your personal data, object to or ask us to restrict our processing or change your settings. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.
We offer a variety of ways for Members and Visitors to control their data. The easiest way to control how your data is processed if you are a Member is
via your account settings
and if you are a Visitor
via your Guest settings
.
If you are a Visitor and you would like to contact LinkedIn about processing of your data or exercising the rights outlined in this section, you can reach out using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this
form
.
Members can also object, correct inaccurate data, delete data, port data and in some cases restrict the use of their data as set out in this section:
Accessing your data
Members can access and download their data at any time. We will provide your data in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your
Member Settings
. You can learn more about how to download your data
here.
Correct and rectify your data
When Members are signed in to our platform you can always review and update your profile information. You can also ask us to change, rectify or not use your data if it is not accurate. You can edit or correct most of your personal data at any time directly in your account settings. If there is any personal data not listed in your account settings that you would like to correct or update you can
complete a data rectification form.
You can learn more about how you can change or correct your personal data
here
.
Deleting your data
You can request that we delete your personal data. Most of your profile data can be deleted
through your account settings.
You can learn more about deleting your data
here.
For any data that cannot be deleted in your settings, you can submit a
Data Deletion request form
. If you would like to delete all your personal data from LinkedIn, you can always choose to
close your account.
Restricting the use of your data
One of the ways you can restrict how your data is used is in your
Data Privacy settings
and your
Advertising Data settings
. You can also request that processing of your data is restricted if the data is inaccurate or if you believe that the processing is unlawful by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this
form
.
Objecting to the use of your data
You also have the right to object to processing your data where legitimate interest or public interest is the legal basis for processing that data. To exercise your right to object you can contact us by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or complete our
Data Processing Objection form
.
Where you raise an objection, we will consider your request, our legal obligations, and whether we have a compelling interest in continuing to process your data. In certain cases, consistent with your legal rights and our obligations, we may not be able to fulfil your request—for example, we cannot stop processing your IP address when it is used to authenticate your login details, as this is a security measure that is essential to protect our site. In contrast, you can remove information about your education or work experience from your profile (although as a result, the job recommendations you receive may not be relevant to you) so that we don’t process it.
Where we use your data for direct marketing (e.g. to send you marketing emails) or profiling for the purposes of direct marketing, you always have the right to object and we will stop using your data for this purpose.
Portability
If we use your personal data to perform a contract with you, or with your consent, you have the right to receive your data and port it to another controller. You can download your data anytime in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your
Member Settings
and can learn more about how to download your data
here.
LinkedIn also provides an
API program
to enable third parties to build integrations with LinkedIn to port data on a Member’s consent in the EEA, EU and Switzerland only. You can find more details in the
Member Portability APIs
help centre article.
Withdrawing your consent
When you give us consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent via Member settings for certain processing, or by contacting us
here
. When you withdraw your consent, this won’t affect our use of your data up to that point.
Joint Controller Relationship

We are a joint controller with the organisation or legal entity who administers the Business Page for this purpose, and Members can find out more information about LinkedIn’s responsibilities
here
.
Data Retention
We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalised or aggregated form.
You can
delete data from your profile or your activity
on LinkedIn. If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn. Search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo! may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about
how your profile shows up in search engine results
. Where we share your data with other third parties, as set out in our
Privacy Policy
, e.g. via the LinkedIn Developer Program, they may retain data in accordance with their own retention policies, or in line with our contractual agreements with them.
For data that LinkedIn collects using cookies, you can see how long LinkedIn processes it for by checking the expiration periods in our
Cookie table
. LinkedIn may also collect information about you from cookies on third party websites. For data collected from third party websites where a LinkedIn customer has installed LinkedIn’s tag, LinkedIn de-identifies your personal data after 7 days and permanently deletes it after 180 days.
There are a number of reasons why we might need to retain some of your data for longer than usual. These may include:
Where LinkedIn has suspended your account for inappropriate, harmful or illegal activity that breaches our Professional Community Guidelines and/or we need to resolve complaints relating to your account.
Where there is ongoing or potential legal or regulatory proceedings related to your account.
Where we are required by law to retain your data. For more information on when we may be required to retain your data for these purposes, see the “
Compliance with Legal Obligations
” section above.
Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK
LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law.
LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework
here

LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses

California Consumer Privacy Act
Notice for California Consumers
Last revised December 12, 2022
This notice describes the rights of Californians under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (together, “CCPA”). The CCPA requires businesses like us to provide certain information to California consumers. We fully describe our practices to all our members and visitors in our
Privacy Policy
, but use this separate notice to ensure that we meet the CCPA’s requirements. This notice contains the following four parts:
You Can Opt Out of Our Sharing Your Personal Information. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information.
Your CCPA Rights
The CCPA Categories of Personal Information We Collect and the Sources
The CCPA Categories of Personal Information We Disclose for a “Business Purpose”
1. You Can Opt Out of Our Sharing Your Personal Information. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information.
If you are a LinkedIn member,
click here to opt out of sharing
. Guests can opt out by visiting
guest controls
.
In addition to these controls, in the U.S. we will automatically opt you out of sharing if we receive a Global Privacy Control signal from you that reflects your choice to opt-out of sharing.
The CCPA requires us to disclose if we share your personal information. We may share your personal information, including information about your visits to LinkedIn, with our partners in order to market LinkedIn’s services to you on other platforms. If you are a member, we may also share your personal information with Microsoft to personalize the ads you see when you use Microsoft services.
We do not sell your personal information.
2. Your Rights Under the CCPA
The CCPA provides Californians with the following rights:
2.1 Requests for Information
Like all of our members, you (or your authorized agent) can
request a copy of your personal information
. Under the CCPA, you can also request that we disclose how we have collected, used, and disclosed your personal information over the past 12 months, including the categories of personal information we collected and our purposes for doing so; the categories of sources for that information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared it or disclosed it for a business purpose and our purposes for doing so. Companies that sell personal information (we do not) must make additional disclosures.
If you are not a LinkedIn member,
you can submit your request
here
.
2.2 Your Right to Opt Out of Sales
We do not sell personal information, so we don’t have an opt out.
2.3 Your Right to Opt Out of Sharing
Under the CCPA, you can opt out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. You can direct us not to share your personal information as described in Section 1.
2.4 Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information
Under the CCPA, you can limit a business’s use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to certain purposes specified by law (e.g., providing you with services you request or preventing fraud, or for other purposes that don’t involve deriving your attributes). We only use sensitive personal information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out.
2.5 Your Right to Notification
Under the CCPA, a business like LinkedIn cannot collect new categories of personal information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you.
2.6 Nondiscrimination for Exercising Your CCPA Rights
The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights.
2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information
Like all of our members, you can edit much of your personal information through your LinkedIn account (such as your profile information). You can also
request that we correct inaccurate personal information
.
2.8 Your Right to Delete Personal Information
Like all of our members, you can request that we delete your personal information
by closing your LinkedIn account
or by requesting that we
delete specific information
about you. We honor such requests unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or contract for which it was collected or when information is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, identify and repair bugs, or ensure another consumer’s ability to exercise their free speech rights or other rights provided by law.
2.9 LinkedIn Annual CCPA Metrics

2.10 Statement Regarding Selling or Sharing the Personal Information of Consumers Under Age 16

user agreement
