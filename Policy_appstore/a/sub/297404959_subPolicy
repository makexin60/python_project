Simple and Impressive. I especially loved that there were questions to help me make the best choice. But what I really loved was how very easily I was able to get policies and terms and conditions tailored to my needs. This can be an intimidating process since I wanted to ensure compliance, but their software made it easy and definitely left me feeling very confident.

Excellent! Complying with German data protection laws. The outstanding customer service and ease of creating all the docs you need.I had just about completed a website (I design for friends, so it's not my main job) here in Germany and I needed to be sure I was complying with all data protection laws. They are very strict here, and the fines are huge. I was going round in circle but then found TermsFeed, which sorted everything out for me.

My overall experience was amazing and I'm very happy to continually work with TermsFeed. Pros: How well it was compliant with todays laws and how cheap it was. I would've had to spend thousands on an attorney or lawyer to do the same thing TermsFeed did for much cheaper.

A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement between you and your website/app users that explains how you collect, use, and protect their personal data.
It details what data you collect, how you use it, who you share it with, and how you keep it secure. It also covers your use of cookies and tracking technologies.
Most global privacy laws require a Privacy Policy if you collect personal information.
Yes, the Privacy Policy Generator from TermsFeed is free to use.
You can also purchase optional premium versions with additional clauses for a one-time fee.

Use the Privacy Policy Generator from TermsFeed to create a free Privacy Policy for your business.
No, copying someone else's Privacy Policy is illegal. These documents are protected by copyright laws.
You need a Privacy Policy for two key reasons:
Legal Requirement:
If you collect personal data, you must comply with privacy laws that apply regardless of where your business is located.
Customer Trust:
Consumers expect transparency. Not having a Privacy Policy can damage your reputation and drive customers away.
If you truly don’t collect any personal data, you must still have a Privacy Policy to state that fact.
However, review your data practices carefully. Services like Google Analytics may collect data without you realizing it.
Many countries require a Privacy Policy if you collect personal data, including Canada, the EU, the UK, the U.S., and Australia. Privacy laws are expanding globally.
For details by country, see our article:
Privacy Laws by Country
.
Privacy laws protect residents of specific regions. Even if your business is not in California, you must comply with California privacy laws if you serve California customers.
Key laws to know:
CCPA

GDPR

CalOPPA

COPPA

Cookies are small files stored on a user’s device when they visit a website. They help remember user activity like shopping cart contents or form data.
Whether cookies count as personal data depends on their function and the user’s legal jurisdiction.
No, requesting email addresses without a Privacy Policy is not recommended. Email addresses are considered personal data, and you may face legal liability if you collect them without a Privacy Policy.
Your Privacy Policy must explain why you collect email addresses, how you use them, and users' rights (e.g., opting out).
Your Privacy Policy must be easy to access at all times. Place a link in your website footer and on any page where you collect personal information, such as sign-up forms or checkout pages.
The best way to get user acceptance is through click-wrap, which is clear and legally compliant.
Provide a link to the Privacy Policy with a checkbox or button labeled with a statement like, "By clicking Agree, you accept our Privacy Policy."
Write your Privacy Policy in simple, clear language.
Privacy laws have different requirements, so start by reviewing what personal data your business collects, why you collect it, and how you use it. Use our Privacy Policy Generator or templates for help:
