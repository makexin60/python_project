Tripadvisor LLC owns and operates an online platform that provides users with information, recommendations and services related to travel and leisure, including tools for researching and/or booking hotels, rentals and other accommodations, attractions and experiences, restaurants, flights, and cruises, among other leisure-related services. In this Statement, we refer to these as our “Services”.
The information that you and others entrust us with enhances our ability to provide more relevant, personalized  and helpful Services. We know that sharing your information with us is based on trust. We take your trust in us seriously and are committed to providing you helpful information, products and services, curated based on the information you have shared with us. Equally, and perhaps more importantly, we are committed to respecting your privacy when you visit our website or use our Services and being transparent about how we use the information you have entrusted to us.
This Statement describes how we obtain, use, and process your information – hopefully, in an easily understandable and transparent manner. It informs you of the rights you have, how you can exercise them and how you can contact us. Please review this Statement carefully to learn about our practices with respect to information and privacy. By visiting our websites and related mobile applications, as well as other online platforms such as our affiliated partners’ websites, apps and social media, whether on a computer, phone, tablet, or similar device (each of these is referred to as a “Device”), you acknowledge and confirm that you have read this Statement.

When you use our Services by “clicking-through” from a third-party website or when you visit third-party websites via our Services, those third-party websites may share information with us about your use of their service.

We may share information with certain companies in our corporate family so we can provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and others, which might interest you and to provide payment services. This sharing also allows us to better understand how you interact with the websites, apps and services of our group companies.
These companies
will comply with this Statement and all applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications.
Suppliers
. We may share information with certain suppliers used to facilitate our Services, including where relevant to help with transactions.

Other third parties may also provide us with their content and contract generation, management, and hosting tools. Third parties may only collect or access information as needed to perform their permitted functions. If and to the extent these third parties only assist us to perform our processing operations, we have bound them contractually to only act on our behalf as so-called data processors.
Certain Device operating system versions permit you to opt out of certain types of information sharing, including to certain advertising networks. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time in order to turn off the functionality that collects and shares location information. Please check your Device settings if you want to limit such tracking However, turning off location-sharing may affect certain features that we offer. If you have any questions about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.
We also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:

9. Information from Cookies
We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient, and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance website security, and to show you relevant advertising.
Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends the information from these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognize your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalized content. We also use other tracking technologies, such as pixel, SDKs, or server logs, that have a similar functionality. We also use cookies and tracking technologies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services or to help us understand your preferences.
To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool which allows you to adjust and customize your cookie settings. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking the “Cookie consent” link at the bottom of every page and modify your preferences in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You have the right to withdraw your consent to cookies at any time by clicking on the “Cookie consent” link and modifying and saving your preferences. In the settings of your Internet browser, you can choose which cookies to accept and reject.
We allow third parties to collect and use information obtained during your browsing activities in order to deliver tailored advertisements to you. These parties are listed in our Cookie Consent tool where we provide you with their details and links to their privacy notices.
When you enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up to a newsletter, or similar) or when you use our app, we may share personal data or other information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), mobile advertising identifier, IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our advertising partners, like LiveRamp and the Trade Desk and their group companies, acting as joint controllers. LiveRamp and the Trade Desk use this information to create an online identification code for the purpose of recognising you on your devices. The online identification code does not contain any of your identifiable personal data and will not be used by LiveRamp or the Trade Desk to re-identify you. We place the online identification code in our first-party cookie, a LiveRamp or the Trade Desk cookie, and allow it to be used for online and cross-channel advertising. It may be shared with our advertising partners and other third-party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. web, email, connected devices, and in-app, etc). These third parties may, in turn, use the online identification code link to demographic or interest-based information that you have provided in your interactions with them. You can find detailed information on LiveRamp’s data processing activities, including how to opt-out in their privacy

The right to request correction of your personal information if it is inaccurate. You may also supplement any incomplete personal information we have, taking into account the purposes of the processing.
The right to request deletion of your personal information if:
your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or processed them; or
you withdraw your consent if the processing of your personal information is based on consent and no other legal ground exists; or
you object to the processing of your personal information and we do not have an overriding legitimate ground for processing; or
your personal information is unlawfully processed; or
your personal information must be deleted for compliance with a legal obligation.
The right to object to the processing of your personal information. We will comply with your request, unless we have a compelling overriding legitimate interest for processing or we need to continue processing your personal information to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.
The right to restrict the processing of personal information, if:
the accuracy of your personal information is contested by you, for the period in which we have to verify the accuracy of the personal information; or
the processing is unlawful, and you oppose the deletion of your personal information and request restriction; or
we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of processing, but your personal information is required by you for legal claims; or
you have objected to the processing for the period in which we have to verify overriding legitimate grounds.
The right to data portability. You may request that we send this personal information to a third party, where feasible.

For example, requests involving personal information and/or documents of other individuals will not be shared so as to protect the privacy of those individuals unless permitted by applicable law.
