Privacy Policy
Privacy. That’s Apple.
Privacy.
That’s Apple.
Privacy is a fundamental human right. It’s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That’s the kind of innovation we believe in.
Apple Intelligence.
Great powers come
with great privacy.
Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.
On-device
processing
allows Apple Intelligence to be aware of your data without collecting your data.
On-device processing
The cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on‑device processing, which gives Apple Intelligence the ability to fulfill many of your requests without leaving your device.
Deeply integrated into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac
Powered by Apple silicon
Designed to protect your privacy at every step
Private Cloud Compute
extends the privacy of Apple devices for more complex requests.
Private Cloud Compute
Some requests require more computational power than what fits in your pocket. For these more complex requests, Apple Intelligence can draw on Private Cloud Compute and extend the privacy of your Apple devices to Apple silicon servers.
Your data is only used for your requests
Your data is never stored or made accessible to anyone
Independent experts can verify its privacy promise

Discover everyday privacy protections.
Locked and Hidden Apps.
Choose
what’s
visible.
Locked and Hidden Apps
Locked apps allow you to show your screen to someone while protecting sensitive areas of your phone. For additional privacy, you can hide a locked app. This removes the hidden app’s name and icon from the Home Screen and search results, and pauses its notifications. You can access locked or hidden apps with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.
Private Browsing.
Powerfully
private.
Private Browsing
When you turn on Private Browsing, Safari won’t save the sites you visit, your searches, or any information from forms you fill out. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections help prevent websites from tracking or identifying your device. And your private browsing windows automatically lock when you’re not using them.
Passkeys.
Simple.
Secure.
So not a
password
.
Passkeys
A passkey eliminates the need for a password by using a unique digital key that only works from the site or app it was created for, so you don’t have to worry about website leaks or phishing. Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices. Just use Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate and you’re done.
Lock Hidden Albums.
Keep Hidden
and Recently
Deleted
photos
private.
Lock Hidden Albums
Your Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos are locked by default and can be unlocked using your device’s authentication method — Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.
Safety Check.
Take
control
in times of crisis.
Safety Check
Safety Check is a section in Settings that helps people in domestic or intimate partner violence situations quickly reset the access they’ve granted to others. It also helps you manage which people and apps you’ve given access to.

App Tracking Transparency.
Decide which
apps are
allowed to
track
track
track
track
you.
App Tracking Transparency
Make more informed choices about the apps you use and the permissions you grant them. Apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. And you can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in Settings.
Mail Privacy Protection.
Read
Read
,
delete
,
and
reply
with peace
of mind.
Mail Privacy Protection
Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.
Our apps mind their business. Not yours.
Safari throws trackers off your trail.
Safari
Some websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari toolbar.
When you use Private Browsing, the details of your browsing aren’t saved, and the websites you visit aren’t shared with your other Apple devices. And starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Private Browsing locks your private browsing windows when you’re not using them, completely blocks known trackers from loading on pages, and removes tracking added to URLs as you browse.

Health keeps your records under wraps.
Health
From your heart rate to your menstrual cycle, apps and devices for your health can give you insight into some of your most personal details. With the Health app, you’re in charge of what information you’d like to include, what not to, and who has access to it.
When you do want to securely share your health data from the Health app with your doctors, they’ll see the data you shared in a dashboard in the provider’s health records system.
All of your data is encrypted and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID. So however you use the Health app, you’re always in control of your data.
Wallet and Apple Pay help hide what you buy.
Wallet and Apple Pay
When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.
When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.
Maps makes your location history, history.
Maps
Where you go says a lot about you. Maps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. And because Maps doesn’t include a sign-in, where you go isn’t associated with your Apple Account at all.
Personalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly changing.
Photos lets you choose who has the full picture.
Photos
Your photo and video albums are full of precious moments, friends, and your favorite things. Apple devices are designed to give you control over those memories.
Photos is also designed so that the face recognition and scene and object detection — which power features like For You, Memories, Sharing Suggestions, and the People album — happen on device instead of in the cloud. In fact, the A13 Bionic and later chips perform over 100 billion operations per photo to recognize faces and places without ever leaving your device. And when apps request access to your photos, you can share just the images you want — not your entire library.
Messages are only seen by who you send them to.
Messages
From inside jokes to invitations, a lot of life happens in text and video chats. Every blue-bubble message, picture, Animoji, and video is encrypted while being sent between devices.
Smart suggestions in Messages, like pulling up photos to send based on who you’re messaging, are all done on your device.
Siri learns what you need. Not who you are.
Siri
Siri was designed from the beginning to learn your preferences without sharing your identity with Apple or anyone else. You don’t sign in with your Apple Account to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your device thanks to the power of the Apple Neural Engine.
When Apple does process or store data on our servers, it’s associated with a random identifier — a long string of letters and numbers. That data is used only to improve Siri, and we never share or sell it. Apple doesn’t retain audio of your requests unless you choose to share it with us to improve Siri.
Apple News leaves what you read off the record.
Apple News
Many news sources keep track of your identity and create a profile of you. Apple News delivers personalized content without knowing who you are. The content you read is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple Account.
You get editor-curated content and a personalized newsfeed so you can stay up to date with the latest news and stories. And because Apple News uses machine learning, the more you use it, the better your app gets to know what you like — without Apple ever knowing what you’re into.
App Store shows you what’s in store for your data.
App Store
Every one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at Apple.
When you’re checking out an app, you’ll see its Privacy Nutrition Label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location — and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or data brokers.

California Privacy Rights
California consumers have a right to knowledge, access, correction, and deletion of their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. California consumers also have a right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by a business, and a right not to be discriminated against for exercising their California privacy rights. Apple does not sell or share the personal information of California consumers as those terms are defined under California law, and does not discriminate in response to privacy rights requests. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit according to California law.
Apple provides notice of our privacy practices in our
Privacy Policy
. The Privacy Policy includes what personal information is collected, the source of the personal information, and the purposes of use, as well as whether Apple discloses that personal information and if so, the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed. More information about how Apple handles personal information in connection with specific Apple services is presented in service-specific notices at or before your first use of the service and is available at all times on your Apple device or at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
. To view a copy of the latest versions of the service-specific privacy notices and the California-specific disclosures, visit
California Privacy Disclosures
.
California consumers with an Apple account can exercise their rights directly or through an authorized agent by signing in to their Apple account at
privacy.apple.com
. If you are a California consumer without an Apple account and you or your authorized agent would like to exercise your privacy rights, you can make a request to
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
, or by calling 1-800-275-2273. If you do not have an Apple account, Apple will ask you for information that we consider necessary to verify your identity for security and to prevent fraud. This information may include name, contact information, and information related to your transaction or relationship with Apple, but the specific information requested may differ depending on the circumstances of your request. If we delete your personal information, we will both render certain personal information about you permanently unrecoverable and also deidentify certain personal information.
Do Not Track
Apple does not track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Third parties that have content embedded on Apple’s websites such as a social feature or a stock ticker may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Apple website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personal information from Apple’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.
Notice for Minors
Apple offers interactive services that allow you to post content to share publicly or with friends. At any time, you can delete or remove content you have posted by using the deletion or removal options within our services. If you have questions about how to remove content in a specific service or if you would like additional assistance with deletion, you can contact our Apple Support team directly at
support.apple.com/contact
. Although we offer deletion capability for our services, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the services.

Health Privacy Overview
At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. There are four privacy principles that inform everything we do at Apple — data minimization, on-device processing, transparency and control, and security. We build each of these four pillars into our products and features from the beginning, including our health features, such as the Health app and HealthKit. As a result of these protections, Apple works to minimize the amount of health data that it collects and these principles have enabled us to provide you, where possible, with health features without the need to collect your health data:
Data minimization.
We use innovative technologies and techniques to minimize the personal data and health data generally that we, or anyone else, can access. For example, for users using a recent version of watchOS and iOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode enabled, Health app data is end-to-end encrypted. As a result, data in the Health app is not readable by anyone — even Apple.
On-device processing.
We minimize data collection by processing as much of your health data on your device as we can, rather than sending it to a server. For example, data shown in the Health app like Trends & Highlights and Cycle Tracking predictions are calculated on-device.
Transparency and control.
We help you to better understand the data being collected so that you can make your own choices over who you share that data with and how it's used. For example, within the Health app you're in control of what data is shared and who it is shared with. You can view and control data sharing with friends and family, and health care providers in the Sharing tab of the Health app.
Security.
Security protections, such as end-to-end encryption, are the foundations of privacy. Health and fitness data gathered from iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch is encrypted on your device with a passcode, and is securely synced across devices. As a result, data in the Health app is not readable by someone with physical access to your device unless they have your passcode.
To learn more about how the Health app and HealthKit protect your privacy, view the Health App Privacy white paper at
apple.com/ios/health/pdf/Health_Privacy_White_Paper_May_2023.pdf

Consumer Health Personal Data
In some circumstances, Apple may process personal data in order to provide you with the products and features you have requested. A limited amount of this data could constitute consumer health personal data under U.S. state consumer health privacy laws, such as Washington and Nevada. Consumer health personal data is broadly defined under these laws, respectively, as personal data that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that may identify the consumer's past, present, or future physical or mental health status or that is used to identify health status.
Even in the limited cases where we process data that could be considered consumer health personal data, we in a small number of cases only actually use the data to identify health status, as described below. Since consumer health personal data is broadly defined, this policy describes where personal data that Apple processes could include health status information, even if we do not use such data to identify health status or use the data for any other purpose other than to provide you with a requested product or feature.
Consumer Health Personal Data Apple May Collect from You
The limited categories of personal data that we may collect when you use our products or services or contact us, which may constitute consumer health personal data, include those below. These are only collected in very limited cases, with example scenarios as noted:
Physical or mental health or condition, including information about your health conditions, symptoms, status, diagnoses, testing, or treatments.
For instance, if you contact AppleCare for support on one of our regulated health features, you may choose to provide health-related information. You may also choose to add a pass to your Wallet that could include health-related information, such as your vaccination card, which allows you to quickly access your vaccination card from the Wallet app. Apple does not use this data to infer or detect your health status.
Measurements of bodily functions, vital signs, and other related information.
For instance, if you choose to participate in an Apple-sponsored health study, you may be asked to provide information about your symptoms or vital signs (for example, heart rate) as part of your consent to participate in the study. Apple uses this data only for the purposes outlined in the applicable consent. If you participate in a study using an Apple Health Research Study app, you can review our Apple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy at
apple.com/legal/privacy/apple-health-studies
and the informed consent you sign for more information about how we protect your privacy.
Information that could identify your attempt to seek healthcare services or information
. For instance, we may collect information about the apps you download in the App Store in order to provide you the App Store and content you requested, and to personalize your experience. Certain apps you choose to download could be health-related. However, Apple does not use this data to infer or detect your health status.
Other information that could be used to make inferences about or detect the health status of an individual.
For instance, if you choose to sync your data across your devices or store data in iCloud, depending on how you use our features and the information saved to your account, this could include health-related information. However, many of our features and services use end-to-end encryption by default when syncing data, such that your data can be decrypted only on your trusted device. No one else can access your end-to-end encrypted data, not even Apple. You may also enable Advanced Data Protection to protect the majority of your iCloud data. If you choose to enable Advanced Data Protection, the majority of your iCloud data — including iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, and more — is protected using end-to-end encryption. Even if you store data in iCloud using the Standard Data Protection, your iCloud data is encrypted and the encryption keys are secured in Apple data centers so that we can help you with data recovery. Apple does not use iCloud data to infer or detect your health status. You can learn more about iCloud Data Security at
support.apple.com/en-us/102651
.
There are limited circumstances in which Apple transmits but does not store data, some of which may be considered to constitute consumer health personal data. For example, in order to securely transmit your payment information within apps, websites, and Business Chat, it is sent to Apple in encrypted form, where it is briefly decrypted and reencrypted with a merchant-specific key, so that only the merchant, the developer, or their payment processor can decrypt your payment information. Apple does not retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you, and does not use that data to infer or detect your health status.
Sources of Consumer Health Personal Data
Apple may collect consumer health personal data directly from you, from your interactions with our products and services, and from third parties acting at your direction. More information about how Apple receives personal information is available in our Privacy Policy in the section "Personal Data Apple Receives from Other Sources.”
How Apple May Use Consumer Health Personal Data
Apple may use consumer health personal data as reasonably necessary in order to provide you with the products and features you have requested. This may include using consumer health personal data to power our services, to communicate with you, and to comply with law. We may also use consumer health personal data for other purposes at your direction or with your consent. In all instances in which Apple processes personal data, we include more details about the data we process and the purposes in our privacy notices for the product or feature. You can view a complete listing of our privacy notices at any time at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data
.
Apple does not sell your consumer health personal data.
How Apple May Disclose Consumer Health Personal Data
Apple may disclose information, including each of the categories of consumer health personal data with
Apple-affiliated companies
, service providers who act on our behalf, and others as reasonably necessary in order to provide you with the products or features you have requested or others at your direction or when required by applicable law.
Your Consumer Health Personal Data Privacy Rights at Apple
At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. This includes the limited instances where we process or collect consumer health personal data under applicable privacy law. Where consumers are requested to consent to the processing of their personal data, they also have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
To exercise your privacy rights and choices visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
privacy.apple.com
. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that you believe may be available and is not currently available from
privacy.apple.com
, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
. Additional information about how you can exercise your privacy rights can be found in our Privacy Policy in the section "Your Privacy Rights at Apple”.
Privacy Questions
If you have questions about Apple's Privacy Policy or privacy practices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on our behalf, or you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can contact us at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact
or call the Apple Support number for your country or region.
When there is a material change to this Consumer Health Personal Data Privacy Policy, we'll post a notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

Apple Health Research Studies
This Privacy Policy summarizes the information we may collect or receive in connection with your use of any of our health research study Apps and participation in any of our healthcare research studies (each a “Study” and collectively “Studies”). This Privacy Policy does not cover information that we collect or receive about you in other contexts, such as when you purchase an Apple product, browse Apple websites, use other Apple mobile apps, or use for your general non-Study purposes your Apple device such as your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. For our privacy practices generally, please see our
general privacy policy
.
Informed Consent
To participate in any Studies, you must first review and sign an informed consent and authorization form (if applicable) ("Informed Consent") for the Study. By using an App, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy and as outlined in the Informed Consent. To the extent anything in this Privacy Policy conflicts with the Informed Consent, the terms of the Informed Consent will control.
Throughout this policy we may use the term "Study Team" to refer to all the entities that may have access to data collected from or about you through the Apps or as part of the Studies. For all Studies the Informed Consent will include specific information about the members of the Study Team.
Collection and Use of Information
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. Certain personal information and non-personal information, as described below, may be collected from or about you through the Apps or as part of the Studies.
Apple and its affiliates, and the other Study Team members, may share the information we collect through the App with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you decide to participate in the Study, below are examples of the types of information that we may collect and how we may use it.
What information we collect
When you download one of the Apps and enroll in one of the Studies, below are examples of the categories of information (which may include some personal information) that may be collected from or about you through the Apps ("Study Data"). The specific categories of information that will be collected about you as part of a Study will be described in the Informed Consent.
Contact information
such as your name, email address,  and phone number.
Demographic information
, such as your age, gender, state of residence, and race.
Medical history and information
, such as your height/weight, prior medical diagnosis and testing (e.g., diagnosis of an irregular heart rhythm), current and previous use of certain medications (e.g., blood thinning medications), certain family history (e.g., history of atrial fibrillation) and health habits (e.g., smoking). This information may be collected through in-app surveys or other health surveys that you may be asked to complete.
Sensor information
, such as heart rate and beat to beat calculations.
Technical data
, which in many cases is non-personal information, i.e., data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. Technical data includes, for example, information about your app usage (e.g., when an App was first launched), app version and installation ID, device identifier, and technical data about your device, such as operating system and model. Apple does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals.
Adverse event information
, such as a concern, adverse event, or other reportable matter arising in a Study.
Other information
, if any, described in the Informed Consent.
Your Contact information will be separated from the rest of the data collected from you through the Apps and as part of the Studies and replaced with a random code ("Coded Study Data") before it is received on Apple systems.  When Apple acts as the study sponsor, it is obligated to put in place a process that could include the review of non-Coded Study Data as needed to comply with law in certain jurisdictions or to fulfill Apple’s obligations as sponsor. Apple hires a third party to fulfill such obligations on its behalf and only Coded Study Data is received on Apple systems. For certain studies, if you experience a technical issue and consent to be transferred to Apple for additional technical support, Apple may have  access to certain information that directly identifies you. Other entities involved in the Study, such as the Study principal investigator or other Study Team members, may maintain Study Data in an identifiable form.
How we use your information
Your personal information, such as your contact information, if collected through the App, may be used for purposes described in the Informed Consent including:
To enroll you in the Study, including determining your eligibility for participation in the Study
To conduct and support the Study
To contact you with surveys or other messages related to the Study through in-app notifications, email, or otherwise
Your Coded Study Data may be used for purposes described in the Informed Consent including:
To conduct and support the Study
To develop health-related products and improvement activities
For other research studies, if permitted in the Informed Consent
To issue research findings and related reports, which will not identify you
Your technical data (as described above) may also be used to determine your eligibility for a Study and general usage of the Apps.
Disclosure to Third Parties
Service Providers
Apple and the other Study Team members may share your information with companies who provide services for or on behalf of the Study such as the independent third party institutional review board responsible for reviewing the Study and protecting your rights as a research participant, or third parties that have been hired to perform Study-related services, such as receiving and processing Study-related complaints, on our behalf. These companies are obligated to protect your information.
Others
Your personal information and Coded Study Data may also be disclosed to the following third parties:
Government and Regulatory authorities
, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and other federal or state government agencies.
Law enforcement or other third parties
pursuant to valid legal process such as a subpoena, litigation or court order. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
Other Approved Study Researchers
, if permitted by the Informed Consent certain third-party researchers who are approved may access limited Study Data. The categories of approved study researchers, the type of Study Data they may have access to, and the purposes that they may use the data for will be described in more detail in the Informed Consent.
Others,
if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. We disclose information as described in the Informed Consent. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
Protection of Your Information
Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Apple has implemented reasonable measures to keep the Study Data it maintains safe, and to protect the confidentiality of your information, including storing it in systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. Despite our security measures, total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
Retention of Personal Information
Your participation in any Study is voluntary. You may decide not to participate or you may leave any Study at any time. If you decide to withdraw, we may not delete the information that we have already collected and we may continue to use it, but we will stop receiving any new Study Data about you and will stop contacting you about the Study except in the case of serious, actionable medical need. The specific retention policies and the steps you need to take to withdraw will be described in the Informed Consent for each Study.
Children
Our Apps are not intended for children under the age of 13 or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
Privacy Questions
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy please
contact us
. If you have questions about a Study please contact a Study Team member using the contact information listed in the Informed Consent. To withdraw from the Study, please follow the specific instructions in the Informed Consent. Please note that deleting an App will not withdraw you from the Study.
Apple may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we change the policy in a material way, notice will be provided to you either in the App or through a Study-specific email along with the updated Privacy Policy. We may also provide a notice on any Study-specific website.
