PRIVACY POLICY
Our privacy policy at Pangea Software is simple: we don't share our customer data with anyone. That's mainly because we don't have any customer data to share since 99% of our sales are on the Apple App Store which does not provide us with any customer data, but also because we respect your privacy.
We do not store credit card information anywhere, and we do not give out or sell any customer lists.
Some of our iOS apps track
anonymous
usage data  so that we can see how much our users play our games and for how long, but no personal information is ever exchanged. Your privacy is safe with us!
