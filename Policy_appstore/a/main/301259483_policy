.
We operate websites, mobile applications, a digital reading platform that enables customers to acquire and read or listen to written works (through ebooks, audiobooks, or podcasts) using a variety of electronic devices, software applications, and other services (collectively, the "Kobo Services") and the account you use in association with the Kobo Services (the "Kobo Account").
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information (as defined below) about you when you use your Kobo Account or any Kobo Services that link to this Policy, including Kobo Writing Life, the author self-publishing service.
1. Collection of personal information
Generally, we collect, process, and use your Personal Information when you:
register for a Kobo Account or log into an existing account;

You may in some cases have the option to decline providing us information. However, your choice to not provide information may impact your use of certain features or services.
"Personal Information" is any information or a combination of pieces of information that can reasonably permit you to be identified, or that can reasonably be linked to you. “Sensitive Personal Information” includes certain types of Personal Information that have been designated in various privacy and data protection laws as “sensitive’ or belonging to “special categories” due to their ability to be used by unauthorized recipients to perpetrate fraud, theft, or discriminatory treatment of individuals, such as financial account information, username/password combinations, health data, religion, political affiliation or union membership, and demographic information such as race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Kobo does not collect or store any Sensitive Personal Information except your Kobo Account credentials and payment information, unless you choose to provide this type of information about yourself in your profile, comments, or reviews. Information that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable person is not Personal Information, and we may use such aggregated or de-identified information for any business purpose, without attempting to re-identify it.

5. Legal basis for using your Personal Information
If you use the Kobo Services while in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or any other jurisdiction with laws similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , we must have a legal basis to process your Personal Information for the purposes above, including data received from social media platforms, data received from other sources used for statistics or data shared with third party advertisers.

Notice of Financial Incentives: We may provide an opportunity to sign up to receive interest-based content via email by providing us your name, email address, or other personal contact information. There is no obligation to opt-in, and you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions in the mailing. From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive to those who sign up for or remain on our mailing list, complete a market research survey, make a purchase, or do not complete a purchase that was begun, such as a discount coupon or an opportunity to win a prize or giveaway in a random drawing. The details of each incentive program will be contained in the program terms. We offer these programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you, to provide you with content that may be of interest to you, and/or so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. The CCPA requires certain disclosures related to financial incentive offerings, including in relation to the value of your consumer data to our business. Although we do not calculate the value of consumer data to our business in our accounting statements, we make this good faith estimate for California residents to use in making an informed decision whether or not to take advantage of any financial incentive or price or service difference we may offer that relates to the collection, retention or sale of your personal information. The value of this customer data would vary from program to program and among individuals, but our method for calculating this value and its reasonable relation to any price or service difference offered would be, for each program, and in the aggregate, whether and by what amount the sales generated by the program(s) exceed the cost to us of offering them, which would include costs associated with (1) any financial incentives that are paid to consumers; (2) the cost of the marketing and distribution of the offer; (3) our marketing team’s efforts to enhance the resulting consumer data through campaign optimization and consumer engagement at sufficient scale; (4) leveraging our past investments in understanding consumers as our existing and future customers; (5) collecting and maintaining data as intellectual property; and (6) all other costs reasonably related to the programs.
9. Third party Websites
The Kobo Services may contain links to websites not owned or controlled by Kobo. We encourage you to be aware of when you are visiting these other third-party websites and to understand their privacy statements, as we cannot control and are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of third-party websites you may choose to visit. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by Kobo. Please review the Terms of Use for more information.
10. Security and Data Retention
We care about the security of your Personal Information. We deploy administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing to the Personal Information we collect. We evaluate these safeguards on an ongoing basis to help minimize risks from new security threats as they become known. However, no information system can be 100% secure. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. We need your help too: it is your responsibility to make sure that your Personal Information is accurate and we encourage you to ensure that your password is unique, secure and not shared with third parties.
We retain the information collected via the Kobo Services for as long as we have a relationship with you, and until such time as you choose to close your Kobo Account, subject to a reasonable retention period as may be required by law. After that time, we will only retain your Personal Information if we are required to do so to comply with local law, or if there are outstanding claims or complaints that will reasonably require your Personal Information to be retained. We may also anonymize and aggregate the data and retain the data in that form for analytical purposes.
11. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The effective date of the current Privacy Policy is noted at the top of this page. We may notify you in writing where we materially change these terms, for example, by posting a banner on the Services, however we encourage you to periodically review this Policy for updated terms.

CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DORMANCY PROTOCOL
Last updated: April 2024
A.     Kobo’s initiation of a Customer Account Dormancy Protocol
i.       Rationale
To adhere to the privacy principle of "data minimization", Kobo’s collection of personal information is restricted to that which is directly necessary to accomplish a specified purpose, and that same information is retained only as long as is necessary to fulfil that purpose. Aligned with this principle, Kobo’s Customer Account Dormancy Protocol serves to remove User Accounts that are not in use. The timelines and notice periods referenced under this Customer Account Dormancy Protocol may be revised at Kobo’s sole discretion.
ii.       The Duty to act Reasonably - provision of advance notice of account deletion.
An integral component of an account dormancy protocol is ample and clear advance notice to the User of the impending deletion of their account. In the absence of advance notice, there is a question of the reasonableness of the service provider’s actions or its means of carrying out the action.
B.     Framework and Rollout.
i.       Framework
A Kobo User Account is deemed inactive if there is no activity at the account level for a dormancy period. Kobo, at its discretion, has determined the dormancy period be at least three (3) years. The dormancy period may be modified at Kobo’s discretion. At this time, the dormancy period is a minimum of 3 years from the most recent of the user’s last acknowledged and recognized action with Kobo (be it the opening of a Kobo account or the download or synchronization of eContent under the account), or 3 years from the latest activation of the Kobo eReader. Kobo will, provide advance notice to the User of the impending deletion of their account where the protocol is being exercised. The provided notice will also set out the means to reset the determination of the inactivity of the account.
Personalized notice by direct email may be problematic as a means of informing a user of the impending deletion of their account because of the volume of emails that may be generated and the associated potential for Kobo to be "blacklisted" by ISPs. However, trickling the release of notice emails is one of the means to manage and navigate ISP blacklisting.
ii.       Roll-out
The Customer Account Dormancy Protocol, at this time, is only focused on the deletion of user accounts with no secured eContent or credits from the Kobo eReading platform that are dormant as defined under this Protocol.
The Customer Account Dormancy Protocol is not applicable to customer accounts that contain content secured from the Kobo eReading platform.
For the initiation of the application of this Customer Account Dormancy Protocol, the dormancy of qualifying accounts will be for periods far greater than the immediate past three years (i.e., the backlog) as no dormancy protocol has been in place prior to commencement of this protocol. To manage the backlog of dormant accounts efficiently, Kobo elects to not provide advance notice of impending deletion for accounts with no purchased eContent or credits. However, once the backlog is cleared and Kobo is determining dormancy relative to accounts on a rolling current monthly expiry of three-year dormancy window, notice will be provided in advance of deletion to all dormant accounts that do not contain purchased eContent or credits.
iii.       The Revision of the Terms of Use and Terms of Sale.
The Terms of Use and Terms of Sale (i.e., the "Terms") set out the conditions placed upon a User as a recipient of Kobo's services and products.
The intent of an account dormancy protocol will be contemplated under the Terms so that the deletion of accounts is not readily characterized as an arbitrary act, but instead an action that complies with the Terms.
Proposed revisions to relevant provisions of the Terms are attached under appendices. Once the Terms are fully revised (as other matters beyond this analysis may dictate further revisions), it is prudent to expect that Kobo highlight the revision of the Terms to the entire user base, recognizing that Kobo is revising the Terms that were in place for many of these users when they initially established their relationship with Kobo.
iv.       Miscellaneous matters
Note, sideloaded content remains on the locally encrypted device or application. Therefore, recapture of sideloaded content is always available, even in instances of account deletion, by re-registration of an account as the sideloaded eContent remains on the user device or application.
C.    Appendices
Proposed revision of Terms of Use and Terms of Sale (found at Appendices 1 and 2).
Proposed Data Retention Policy, inclusive of the Customer Account Dormancy Protocol (all as found at Appendix 3).
