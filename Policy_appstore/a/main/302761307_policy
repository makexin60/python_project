EarthCam - Privacy Policy
EarthCam's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. EarthCam takes your privacy concerns seriously and firmly supports protecting your privacy online.
				EarthCam will never deliberately reveal private information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user's consent.
				EarthCam will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Please read through this policy statement to understand our practices regarding privacy and
				learn how we use the information collected from you. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our websites.

				sign up for EarthCam's services, post an image to the Hall of Fame, post an image to Facebook or Twitter, and send postcards or whenever you enter an EarthCam sweepstakes or other
				EarthCam promotion. The user's contact information is used to allow the user to utilize EarthCam features, contact the user when necessary, and advise them about new services, products,
				and/or software upgrades. The user's Facebook and Twitter account information will only be utilized to post an image or video to the user's account as requested by the user.
				Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings – see the Choice / Opt-Out section below. If EarthCam intends to disclose personal information in some restricted situation,
				this is specifically explained to you when we collect the information in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.

				concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

				our agreements.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example,
				because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing
				until deletion is possible.
