Frequently Asked Questions
How do I restore an app that I accidentally deleted?
If you accidentally delete an app, or you want to install the app on a new device, you can download it again from the App Store. As long as you are logged into the same App Store account you won't be charged a second time. The download will be free. The App Store may ask for your password before telling you the download is free, which can be a little bit confusing but you will not be charged again.
How do I turn on phonics? I prefer them to letter names.
You can find the phonics setting by tapping the "Options" button and looking under "Language." For apps that only feature one language, phonics can be turned on via the "Spelling" setting.
Aren’t there more words? I thought I saw a word, but now it’s not there.
If you have the language set to phonics or the maximum word length set to something lower than 8, you will see fewer words. To see all the words, you should use the “Letter Names” language setting and set the maximum word length to the highest value.
General Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble with an app misbehaving, try some of the following steps:
Fully quit the app and restart it.
Shutdown and restart your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.
Delete the app from your device and then add it back by downloading it again from the App Store.
