TIP:
Chase will never ask you to send money back to yourself to reverse fraud on your account or to fix an issue.
For sale, hot deal
"Get a great price on these exclusive sneakers. You can pay using cash or a payment app."
TIP:
Be cautious of great "deals" on social media sites. Once you send money you may not get it back.
Computer virus
"We've detected malware on your computer. Let's get that fixed for you. There will be a small cost to make your computer secure."
TIP:
Never give anyone remote access to your computer unless you can 100% verify who they are.

Frequently asked questions
How do I know if an email received is a scam?
Scam emails are often poorly written. Look out for typos, grammatical errors and other signs that an email was not written by a legitimate company.
What should I do if I suspect I've been targeted by a scammer?
If it's a phone call, hang up. If it's an email or text message, stop responding. If you think you've given the scammer personal or account information, please contact us so we can help assess your situation.
You may also want to report suspicious calls, emails, and text messages to the
