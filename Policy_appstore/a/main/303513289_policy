Makayama Holding B.V. - Privacy Policy

Updated January 15, 2025

MakayamaÊ¼s Privacy Policy describes how Makayama collects, uses, and shares
your personal data.
In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information
embedded in our products and certain features that ask to use your
personal data. This product-specific information is accompanied by our
Data & Privacy Icon.
You will be given an opportunity to review this product-specific
information before using these features. You also can view this
information at any time, either in settings related to those features and/or
online at makayama.com/privacy.html
You can familiarize yourself with our privacy practices, accessible via the
headings below, and contact us if you have any questions.

What Is Personal Data at Makayama?
+
At Makayama, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights â€” and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on
where you live in the world. ThatÊ¼s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is
linked or linkable to them by Makayama as â€œpersonal data,â€ no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that
directly identifies you â€” such as your name â€” is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can
reasonably be used to identify you â€” such as the serial number of your device â€” is personal data. Aggregated data is
considered non-personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy covers how Makayama or an Makayama-affiliated company (collectively, â€œMakayamaâ€) handles personal data whether you
interact with us on our websites, through Makayama apps (such as Makayama Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when
visiting an Makayama Store). Makayama may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in
our App Store. MakayamaÊ¼s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage
you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.
Your Privacy Rights at Makayama
+
At Makayama, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We
have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right
not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Makayama. Where you are requested to
consent to the processing of your personal data by Makayama, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified.

There may be situations where we cannot grant your request â€” for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and
Makayama is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where
doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of
an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it
jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or unreasonable.

data that we need. The personal data Makayama collects depends on how you interact with Makayama.

not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.
MakayamaÊ¼s Use of Personal Data
+
Makayama uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security
and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.
Makayama uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Makayama may
rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or
those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or othersÊ¼
legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in the
product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. Makayama collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data
collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For
example, if you would like to access a song through an Makayama Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play
in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.

payment information.
Communicate with You. To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our
products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may

options are available, Makayama will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or
communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by
reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make
this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon. Comply with Law. To comply with applicable law â€” for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with
a lawful governmental request.
Makayama does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for
human review. Makayama also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to
exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
Makayama retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as
described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain your
personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific
privacy notices. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the
personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period
permissible under law.
MakayamaÊ¼s Sharing of Personal Data
+
Makayama may share personal data with Makayama-affiliated companies, service providers who act on our behalf, our partners,
developers, and publishers, or others at your direction. Further, Makayama does not share personal data with third parties for
their own marketing purposes.
Service Providers. Makayama may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our
behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and
delivering products to customers. Makayama service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this
Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and
must delete or return the personal data once theyÊ¼ve fulfilled our request.
Partners. At times, Makayama may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Makayama
financial offerings like Makayama Card and Makayama Cash are offered by Makayama and our partners. Makayama requires its partners to
protect your personal data.
Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription. If you purchase a third-party subscription from the
App Store or within Makayama News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The
Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the
subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular
developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided
to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
Others. Makayama may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share
information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that
for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or
appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the
event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.

protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We
are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. 
Children and Personal Data

processes and protections to help keep childrenÊ¼s personal data safe.

or, in the case of a Managed Makayama Account, by the childÊ¼s educational institution.

personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
