BRAVE 8 LITE
AKASO Seemor provides astonishingly vibrant full-color night vision in low-light conditions with AI-ISP. True colors at 99% vibrancy, even in darkness. Observe humans and animals at 1640ft, buildings at 3280ft.
Built Versatile for Any Challenge
The Akaso Brave 7 is meant to be an affordable contender that offers some premium features to users who either don't want or don't really need some fancy image stabilization or more than 50 shutter speed settings. As such, it's more than lived up to expectations.

COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND HOW WE USE THEM
A 'cookie' is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer or mobile device [hard drive]. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A 'web beacon' or 'pixel tag' or 'clear gif' is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.
We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to the AKASO website. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you.
We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.

As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.
If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.
EMAILS
You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from AKASO or its affiliates you can click on the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us.
