Keyboard Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. We don't see, or collect anything you type.
What information is Collected?
Don’t worry we can’t see anything that you type. We don't track your keystrokes. When you email us from the App we only collect your device model and iOS version. This helps us to assist you if you require assistance.
Why do we require ‘Allow Full Access’
Turning on Allow Full Access allows us to give you the best possible experience. We require full access to do the following:  Copy your drawings to clipboard to allow you to paste it, and for video backgrounds to work. We have no access to any of the above mentioned. No information is collected by us. The Keyboard is still functional if you do not turn on Allow Full Access.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
The privacy policy maybe changed, or updated at anytime. You can always find the latest version of the privacy policy here. If you have any questions please contact us.
