ABOUT THE GAME
Vía is a maze puzzle game where players have to find their way through complex and challenging paths. Moving across each path might sound simple, but more than one hurdle will get in the way.
Visually simple and engaging in its complexity, Vía will demand the best puzzle solving skills from anyone that ventures through its intricate paths.
For an extra challenge try collecting all color gems. Each collected gem will reveal a part of its journey’s art canvas.
The free version of the game will grant you access to the first 4 journeys. Purchasing the game will unlock all remaining journeys.
The full game features 12 journeys, each containing 10 new paths.
