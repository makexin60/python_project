There are three types of data and information which may be collected from Users of our Children Apps:
3.1 Non-personal Information

“Non-personal Information”
). To put it simply, with respect to such children Non-personal Information, we and our Third Parties are not aware of the identity of the User from whom children Non-personal Information has been collected. Children Non-personal Information collected by us or our Third Parties may include technical information such as: type and version of operating system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.), User session ID, time zone, session start / stop time, source of traffic (e.g. which ads, sites, applications and campaigns a User came from and associated revenue), App version, language (e.g. English), device type/model (e.g. Galaxy, iPhone, etc.), data regarding User behavior within Children Apps (e.g. ad impressions, User’s response to ads, including ads viewed or clicked), User’s in-app purchases including data regarding receipt validation, User’s gameplay (e.g. level reached, frequency and time spent in the Children App and in each level, game progress, fail rate, mini game(s) played, virtual currency (if any) collected or earned, virtual inventory items (if any), tools and in-app functionalities used, screens accessed, User retention, performance errors and problems (e.g. Children Apps’ stability, crashes, functioning, etc.), and other predefined events and behavior relating thereto (e.g. if User viewed a specific ad and other game play events, time of the event, internet connectivity (Wi-Fi, 3G), device time zone, etc.), our other installed Apps, User age-related information (if a User passes an age-gate i.e. if the User is below or above the age of 13 or the minimum age of majority), and geo-location – only at a country.

3.2 Children’ Persistent Device Identifier and No Other children personal identifiable information:
We and Third Parties may passively collect a persistent device identifier from children, such as advertising identifier (IDFA, Advertising ID), randomly generated User ID and IP address (
“Children Persistent Device Identifier”
). This is processed for the limited purposes of supporting the internal operations of the Children Apps. We do not collect and do not permit Third Parties to collect from children any information that may personally identify an individual (e.g. name, address, e-mail) or any other personally identifiable information of a private and/or sensitive nature about children. We note that we may collect, use and provide access to the User’s advertising identifier in accordance with the applicable platform provider’s policies.
We do not link any additional personally identifiable information to the Children Persistent Device Identifier, even from other services.
We do not collect or process any financial or payment information, any government identification numbers, any non-public phonebook or contact information, or any sensitive device data concerning children.
3.3 Information gathered through “Support” type of a request:
If a child e-mails a question to our support team, we may respond to such question by using the child’s e-mail address. Promptly after responding (or, at our discretion, not responding) to such question, we will delete the child’s e-mail address.
Purpose of the collection:
The information described above is collected and processed solely for the purpose of supporting our internal operations. This means the following:

capping the frequency of advertising;
ensuring legal or regulatory compliance;
fulfilling a User’s request under Section 3.3.
The collection and/or processing in connection with these purposes will be performed as permitted under applicable laws and rules.
How is the Information about our Users of Children Apps being collected?
The Non-personal Information and Children Persistent Device Identifier are collected either by us or our Third Parties through the Users’ use of Children Apps, including through Third Parties’ SDKs embedded in our Children Apps. Non-personal Information and Children Persistent Device Identifier may also be stored locally on the Users’ device via generally accepted industry technologies used within Children Apps, such as “cookies-like technology” and local storage (see Section 17 below for further details on Cookies and Local Storage).
If Third Parties collect Non-personal Information, Children Persistent Device Identifier and/or any other information directly from children, such collection and processing is governed by such Third Parties’ privacy policies and not by this
Privacy Policy
. However, all Third Parties are carefully selected to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws, and we confirm that they are compliant with COPPA, this Privacy Policy and the rules, policies and guidelines of the applicable Platform Provider in performance of their services.
In addition to the processing of information described in this policy, some of our Apps may also access Personal and Non-personal Information but without Crazy Labs carrying out any processing.  In these cases, an App may access the information but it is not transmitted outside of your device and Crazy Labs does not collect or use it in any way. An App may access information in this way in order to provide functionality necessary for particular features of the App.
Face Manipulation feature.
Some Apps may include a functionality which allows you to take a picture or create a video using your camera and microphone. Some Apps may allow Users to apply filters or edit photos and videos created via the App and use them within the App (for example to add to a simulated ‘social media feed’ in the App). This functionality is optional and you can always use the App without it. If you use this feature then you will need to grant the App permission to access your device’s camera and microphone (which can be revoked at any time through your device’s settings and its revocation will not affect your use of the App). Photos and Videos created via the App will be automatically saved in the App’s gallery and will be retained until you delete them from the App gallery or uninstall the App. You may also save these photos or videos in your device’s gallery, if you grant the App permission to approach it, and they will be retained there until you delete them from the device’s gallery. The App does not collect any face data, and the photos and videos that you create are restricted to the App, locally stored and are not transmitted to the Company’s servers and are not used or accessed by the Company. The App does not grant access to, share  or disclose to any third party any of the photos and videos you create via the App, but Users who are 16 years old or older may share such photos and videos from within the App via the device operating system’s share functionality. Such sharing will be governed by the policies of the applicable Social Network or third party Platform.
4. Sharing children information with third parties
We may share the Children Persistent Device Identifier only in limited cases, including the following:
to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental request;
to enforce this Children Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof;
to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, its Users, suppliers, licensors, and/or licensees, or the general public;
when the Company is undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of Company, in which case it may also be disclosed, transferred and/or assigned; and/or
pursuant to the approval of a child’s legal guardian, in order to supply certain services that such legal guardian or the User of Children Apps may have requested from the Company.
To clarify, we may transfer and disclose Children Non-personal Information to third parties at our discretion.

We accept ads from Third Party ad networks which may be displayed in Children Apps. These Third Parties ad networks are carefully selected to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws, and we confirm that they are compliant with COPPA, this Privacy Policy and the rules, policies and guidelines of the applicable Platform Provider. Note that if the User of Children Apps clicks on any of these ads, the User will leave our Children Apps and go to the advertisers’ site which the User selected, and the advertisers may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect Non-personal Information and/or children personally identifiable information. We recommend that children and their legal guardians review the terms of use and privacy policies of these advertisers. Their privacy policy, not ours, will apply to any of those interactions. We may also promote Children Apps in Third Parties’ applications and platforms.

17. Cookies & Local Storage
When you access or use the Apps, we and/or our Third Parties may use industry-wide technologies such as “cookies”, web
beacons, tags and local storage (or other similar technologies), which store certain local information on your device
(“Local Storage”)
, to identify a User’s device and ‘remember’ things about the User which may enable automatic
activation of certain features (for example, if a User muted the sound within the App at a certain stage, this
preference will be stored in the cache on the device and maintained the next time the User accesses the App on his
device), monitoring of use of the Apps (counting Users who visit certain pages, use certain tools, viewed certain
advertisements), frequency capping (for example, if we promote another App, this ensures that we do not advertise the
same App more than a set number of times), to improve the quality of our services, measure ad performance, provide
relevant ads etc. and making the User’s App experience and usage simpler, more relevant, convenient and effortless.
Such information is locally stored in the User’s device. We and/or our Third Parties may access such information.
Third Parties may use both session cookies (which expire once you close the App) and persistent cookies (which stay on
the User’s device until he/she deletes them). Such Local Storage used by the Apps may store non-personal information
(such as the different pages viewed by a User within the App) as well as User persistent identifier and geo-location
data, which will be collected in accordance with the terms specified herein. It is easy to prohibit and/or delete the
Local Storage, including via uninstalling the App from your mobile device and/or through the Settings option of your
device. Most browsers and platforms will allow you to erase cookies from a device, block acceptance of cookies, or
receive a warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option you may use the
settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider and/or
Third Parties privacy policies and terms of use. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of
your device, your App experience may be affected and may be limited.

online platforms (such as, websites, applications, etc.) and opt out of the use of your information for interest-based
and targeted advertising and/or other services by certain of our third party service providers, please visit the
privacy practices of such Third Parties and follow the instructions specified therein. You can see a list of our Third
Parties at with instructions on how to opt-out when available.

19. International Data Transfer
We may transfer (and store) information collected about you, including Personal Information, to affiliated entities,
or to other third party service providers across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
jurisdictions around the world (all solely for legitimate business purposes). Please note that we may transfer such
information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction,
wherever your Personal Information is transferred we will take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your
Personal Information (such as making transfers subject to standard contractual terms or engaging with host providers
which are privacy-shield certified or offer an equivalent level of protection).  Where we receive requests for
information from law enforcement or regulators, we will carefully validate these requests before Personal
Information is disclosed. You can ask for more details of the steps we take by contacting us as set out in the “Got
Any Questions” section below. We will centralize all privacy-related decisions in (and the Personal Information may
be accessed from) countries that are declared as offering an adequate level of protection of personal data by the
European Commission.
20. California Privacy Rights
20.1 To the extent applicable, if you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a User, California Business
and Professions Code Section 22581 may permit you to remove content or Personal Information you have publicly
posted.  If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information and you specify which content or Personal
Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law.
Please be aware that after removal you will not be able to restore removed content. In addition, such removal does
not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there
may be circumstances in which the law does not require us to enable removal of content.

Your Rights Regarding Personal Information.
California residents have certain rights with respect to the
personal information collected by businesses.  If you are a California resident, you may exercise the following
rights regarding your personal information, subject to certain exceptions and limitations:
The right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, disclose, and
sell about you, the categories of sources from which we collected your personal information, our purposes for
collecting or selling your personal information, the categories of your personal information that we have either
sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties with which we have shared personal
information.
The right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you or maintain about you.
The right to opt out of our sale(s) of your personal information. Please note that if you opt out of certain
types of sales, we will be unable to provide you with the services that rely on such sales.
The right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the
CCPA.
To exercise any of the above rights, please contact us by email to:
privacy@crazylabs.com
or online by using
this webform
and submit the required verifying information.
You may also exercise the right to opt out of our sale(s) of your personal information by clicking the “Do not sell
my Personal Info” button (or a similarly named option) available within the privacy settings of some of our Apps.
This will stop our sale of your personal information within such Apps. You will still receive advertising that helps
us provide our Apps to you.
If you reset your advertising identifier (IDFA, Advertising ID), your request to opt out of sale will not apply to
your new advertising identifier and you will need to select this setting again.
We do not sell the personal information of Users located in California who we know to be less than the age of 16.
Note that we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity or understand the scope of
your request, although you will not be required to create an account with us to submit a request or have it
fulfilled. We will require you to provide, at a minimum information verifying your identity and providing the agent,
where applicable, with written permission to make the request for you. You may designate an authorized agent to make
a CCPA request on your behalf by completing this
form
and providing it to us.
21. Deletion and Modifications of Information
You or, as applicable, your legal guardian or agent, may request, by sending us an email to <privacy@crazylabs.com>,
the following:
a. to receive access to, amend, and/or delete your Personal Information and/or, as applicable, Children Persistent
Device Identifier, that we may hold, and/or that we cease collection or use of your Personal Information; and/or
b. that we request Third Parties who collected through the Apps the User’s Personal Information and/or, as applicable, the Children Persistent Device Identifier, to do the same. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that such Third Parties do so, but we recommend you contact them directly in accordance with their privacy policies to ensure that your request is processed.
One Third Party we work with in relation to our apps is Admob. We cannot amend or delete your Personal Information collected and stored by AdMob, However, you may modify or delete any such information by utilizing the tools and instructions provided by AdMob. For details on how to do this, please refer to:
AdMob Privacy Policy
and
Google Partner Sites Policy
.
For some of our Apps we may develop in-app deletion request functionality which can be used by you in addition to
the address above.
After you have stopped using the Apps, we will retain User’s Personal Information, and, as applicable, Children
Persistent Device Identifier, collected through the use of the App for a reasonable period, as is necessary to
fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, as those are specified above, including to comply with our legal
or business requirements, to resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and/or to enforce these Terms and our agreements,
all as permitted under applicable privacy laws.
Personal Information that a User has shared using our Crazy Labs Apps via third party Platform cannot be amended or deleted by us, where such information is in the control of that  third party Platform. We note, however, that you can modify data that a Platform shares with us, or stop our Apps interacting with that Platform by adjusting your settings with that third party provider. However, should you choose to block such interaction, you may not be able to enjoy all the features of
our Apps. Aggregate and/or anonymous information may remain on our servers indefinitely.
In some of our Apps, game progress can be saved to your device’s cloud back up solution (iCloud or Google Drive). This action happens in your account and we do not have access to your account or the data stored within it. We cannot therefore delete this data as part of any deletion request. You will need to manually remove such data yourself from your cloud account.
22. Security
Security of your information is very important to us. We take reasonable measures to maintain the security and
integrity of our Apps and User information and prevent unauthorized access to it or use thereof through generally
accepted industry standard technologies and internal procedures. Please note, however, that there are inherent
risks in transmission of information over the Internet or other methods of electronic storage and we cannot
guarantee that unauthorized access or use will never occur. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW THE COMPANY
SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR ACCESS, HACKING, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSIONS OR
THE THEFT, ALTERATION, DELETION, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, OR LOSS OF ANY DATA OR INFORMATION INCLUDED IN
THE USER GENERATED CONTENT.
23. Changes to the Privacy Policy
The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use of the Apps and any information collected therein. We reserve
the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page frequently to check for any changes. In
case of any material change, we will make reasonable efforts to post a clear notice on the Apps and/or our website
at
. Such material changes will take effect five (5) days after such notice was provided on
our App and/or Site, whichever is the earlier. Otherwise, all other Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective
as of the stated “Last Revised” and your continued use of the Apps on or after the Last Revised date will
constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
24. Got any Questions?
If you have any questions (or comments) concerning this Privacy Policy, you are most welcome to send us an email
to the following address: <privacy@crazylabs.com> and we will make an effort to reply within a reasonable
timeframe. You can also write to us at: Crazy Labs Ltd., 20th Floor, Azrieli Center Circular Tower, 132 Menachem

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

benefits the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.
customized search results
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

.
partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.

the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
