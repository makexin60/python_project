How we protect your privacy
We will process Personal Data in accordance with this Notice, as follows:
Fairness
: We will process Personal Data fairly. This means that we are transparent about how we process Personal Data and that we will process it in accordance with applicable law.
Lawfulness
: We will process Personal Data only on lawful grounds.
Purpose limitation
: We will process Personal Data for specified and legitimate purposes, and will not process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes, unless permitted by applicable data protection laws.
Data minimization

Data accuracy
: We take appropriate measures to ensure that the Personal Data that we hold about you is accurate, complete and, where necessary, kept up to date. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that your Personal Data is kept as accurate, complete and current as possible by informing us promptly of any changes or errors. You should notify us of any changes to the Personal Data that we hold about you (e.g. new home address or change of name).
Data security:
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Data that we collect and process about you.
The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. Specific measures we use include to-date secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices and backups.
Data storage, retention and deletion
We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will identify such Personal Data to which cause of destruction has occurred and delete such data. We will anonymise or destroy personal information in electronic form using technical means that make the information unrecoverable. Personal information recorded or stored on paper will be destroyed through shredding or incineration.
Data storage and transfers of data
All your personal data is stored on our servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, we use third party service providers and business partners who may be operating from outside the EEA and therefore, your data may be transferred to, or accessed from those countries.
We have put in place appropriate safeguards (which includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure that whenever your Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in accordance with the GDPR.
