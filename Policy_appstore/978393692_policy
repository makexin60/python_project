Privacy Policy
Our goal is to make an excellent weather app for you—not to track you!
We don’t want to know anything about you unless you contact us yourself.
To that end, we collect and retain the
least information necessary
to send you a weather forecast and debug any occasional problems that might arise.
We don't track individual users in any way.
Our server keeps a log of weather forecast requests, but these aren't associated with a specific person. (In other words, we don't know who sent the request—only that a request occurred.)
With each request, we also record which versions of the app and OS were used to make the request, so we can make sure you're getting the correct stuff for your version.
All logs are deleted from the server after 1-2 days.
We have not, and will not ever sell any data
to advertisers or 3rd party companies. We think that’s gross, and we want nothing to do with it.
