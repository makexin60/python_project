End User Privacy Statement
End User Privacy Statement
As a data processor, Teckro is committed to protecting your privacy and this Privacy Statement explains the personal data Teckro processes, how Teckro processes it and for what purposes.
Unlike data controllers, data processors have a different set of responsibilities under data protection law, in particular:
Teckro processes personal data on the instructions of the data controller
Teckro has written agreements in place with the data controllers
Teckro takes appropriate steps to ensure that personal data is secure from unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction or accidental loss
What legal basis do we have for processing of your personal data?
We process personal information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:
For the provision of your user account
Where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services / communications for the benefit of our end users
To better understand how people interact with our application
What information do we process?
Teckro processes the initial personal data provided directly from the data controller. This personal data is provided by the data controller to enable the individuals to use our application. These details include the following:
First name
Last name
Email address
Role
Study
Site Number
Institution
Country
These initial details are input to our database which triggers a communication to that individual with Teckro account activation instructions. Once that individual has activated their Teckro account, they become an end user and have the option of entering further personal data within the application e.g.:
Phone number
Photo
Fax number
Fixed landline number
Subsequently, when an end user logs into Teckro, Teckro processes the following personal information:
IP address
Teckro does not intentionally process any “sensitive personal data” or “special categories of personal data”, as defined by Irish and EU law.
At the discretion of the data controller, authorised users (e.g., Study Manager, Investigator, Monitor), may ‘invite’ other person(s) involved in a trial to activate their Teckro account for Teckro access, by inputting their contact information into Teckro.
If the invited user does not activate their Teckro account on Teckro within a set period of time, as agreed with the data controller, a reminder email or emails may be sent to the invitee (and authorized user where relevant). If there is again no response following the final email, personal information will be automatically deleted within the agreed timeframe.
In addition, Teckro also tracks your device details, freely available to third party mobile apps, including:
Manufacturer
e.g., Samsung, Apple
Model
e.g., iPhone, Galaxy
Platform
e.g., Android, iOS
Version
,
Serial Number/UUID
- unique number of device
Teckro uses this information to strengthen the security of communication between your device and our backend services. It also allows Teckro to block ‘suspicious’ devices from accessing backend services when Teckro is notified by the device owner.
How do we use your information?
The personal information provided to Teckro by a data controller or authorized "inviter" enables activation of your Teckro account and subsequent use of products and features available within our application. This and any further information provided by you is then retained to enable future use of your Teckro account.
In accordance with its agreement with the relevant data controller, Teckro may occasionally request feedback via survey completion or internally process information that you provide when using the application. Teckro may also monitor usage patterns on an aggregated / depersonalized basis, which enables us to improve the service we provide to our clients and the end user.
Please note that there may be instances where it may be necessary for Teckro to communicate with you, for administrative or operational reasons (e.g. to inform you that you have been granted access to a study on Teckro, password expiration, system outage, etc.) relating to our service.
Do we share your information?
In accordance with its agreement with the relevant data controller, Teckro may use information internally in aggregate (so that no individual customers are identified) for marketing, strategic development and reporting purposes.
Teckro may also use third party service providers to help us provide elements of our application. Some or all of your personal data may be processed by a third-party service provider. For more information regarding our sub-processors please refer to our sub-processor list which is available at (https://teckro.com/gdpr-subprocessors).
However, Teckro will not pass your personal data to a third-party service provider, other than as described in this Privacy Statement, unless for (a) any successors-in-title to our business; or (b) where such disclosure is required by law.
Where do we store your information?
Data is stored on servers located inside the European Economic Area. By using the Teckro solution you acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed or accessed may be different from those of your own country. However, we have taken steps to ensure that all locations provide a level of security and protection for personal data that meets EU laws.
How do we keep your personal information secure?
The personal data which is provided to and is processed by Teckro is held on secure servers and appropriate steps are taken (both technical and organizational security measures) to protect your personal data, processed by Teckro, in line with applicable law.
How long do we keep personal information?
We keep personal data in accordance with our agreement with the data controller and applicable law.
Links
The Teckro solution may contain links to other websites if requested by a client. Teckro holds no responsibility whatsoever for the security or data privacy measures within an external site. To this end Teckro is not responsible for any liability, of any kind, that may arise in connection with or as a result of the use of the external site in question. However, in order to alert you to the fact that you may be about to navigate to an external website, Teckro provides a pop-up alert within the application whenever you click on an external link.
Does Teckro use cookies?
Yes, cookies are very small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit some websites. Teckro uses these cookies exclusively to help us to remember that you are logged and that your session is secure. These uses are technically necessary for the provision of our service. Please refer to our cookie policy for more information via the link here: teckro.com/cookies-policy (https://www.teckro.com/page/cookies-policy).
Location Services
Teckro does not use location services and does not track your GPS position.
What are your rights?
You enjoy a number of rights under data protection law. These rights are exercisable against the controller, rather than Teckro. However, as a processor Teckro is responsible for assisting the controller when you make a request to exercise your rights.
The exact rights which are available to you may vary depending upon the legal basis relied upon by the controller to process your information.
You have the right to request information about how your information is being used. You also have the right to request a copy of the information that Teckro has about you, request its correction, or request its erasure.
If you would like to exercise you statutory data protection rights, please contact Teckro at
data-privacy@teckro.com
and we can facilitate by referring your request to your data controller.
Will we update this policy?
Our Privacy Policy and Statement may change from time to time and all updates will be posted within the application.

Patient End User Privacy Statement
Patient End User Privacy Statement
As a data processor, Teckro is committed to protecting your privacy and this Privacy Statement explains the personal data Teckro processes, how Teckro processes it and for what purposes.
Unlike data controllers, data processors have a different set of responsibilities under data protection law, in particular:
Teckro processes personal data on the instructions of the data controller
Teckro has written agreements in place with the data controllers
Teckro takes appropriate steps to ensure that personal data is secure from unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction or accidental loss
What legal basis do we have for processing of your personal data?
We process personal information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:
For the provision of the user account
Where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services / communications for the benefit of the end users
To better understand how people interact with our application
Whenever we process data for these purposes, we will ensure that we will always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so, please contact us at
data-privacy@teckro.com
. Please bear in mind that if you object, this may affect our ability to carry out tasks as detailed above for your benefit.
What information do we process?
Your screening ID number is provided to Teckro directly by the data controller. To create your patient account, Teckro generates your unique Teckro Patient I.D. This will be your future username for your Teckro account. There is no personal data required to create your account.
For security and performance monitoring purposes, Teckro logs the following personal data for a minimal duration of time:
IP address
In the provision of additional feature support, and at the request of the data controller, Teckro may also process the following personal data:
Email address associated with the account
Patient medical data captured during participation in a clinical trial
Other types of non-personal data processed are:
Study name
Study number
Site institution details: name, site number, site address, city, country
Therapeutic area under study review
At the discretion of the data controller, authorized users may ‘invite’ person(s) involved in a trial to register for Teckro access, by providing the patient’s screening I.D number to Teckro.
In addition, to better understand how users interact with our application Teckro also tracks your device details, freely available to third party mobile apps, including:
Manufacturer
e.g., Samsung, Apple
Model
e.g., iPhone, Galaxy
Platform
e.g., Android, iOS, Version
How do we use your information?
The information provided to Teckro by the authorized ‘inviter’ enables your registration within our application. This information is then retained to enable future use of your Teckro account.
In accordance with its agreement with the relevant data controller, Teckro may also monitor usage patterns on an aggregated / depersonalized basis, which enables us to improve the service we provide to our clients and the end user.
Do we share your information?
In accordance with its agreement with the relevant data controller, Teckro may use information internally in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing, strategic development and reporting purposes.
Teckro may also use third party service providers to help us provide elements of our application. Your personal data i.e. IP address may be processed by a third-party service provider. For more information regarding our sub-processors please refer to our sub-processor list which is available at
https://teckro.com/gdpr-subprocessors
.
However, Teckro will not pass your personal data to a third party service providers, other than described in this Privacy Statement, unless for (a) any successors-in-title to our business; or (b) where such disclosure is required by law.
Where do we store your information?
Data is stored on servers located inside the European Economic Area. By using the Teckro solution you acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed or accessed may be different from those of your own country. However, Teckro has taken steps to ensure that all locations provide a level of security and protection for personal data that meets EU laws.
How do we keep your personal information secure?
The personal data which Teckro processes is held on secure servers and appropriate steps are taken (both technical and organizational security measures) to protect your personal data in line with applicable law.
How long do we keep personal information?
Teckro keeps personal data in accordance with our agreement with the data controller and applicable law.
Links
The Teckro solution may contain links to other websites if requested by a client. Teckro holds no responsibility whatsoever for the security or data privacy measures within an external site. To this end Teckro is not responsible for any liability, of any kind, that may arise in connection with or as a result of the use of the external site in question. However, to alert you to the fact that you may be about to navigate to an external website, Teckro provides a pop-up alert within the application whenever you click on an external link.
Location Services
Teckro does not use location services and does not track your GPS position.
What are your rights?
You enjoy a number of rights under data protection law. These rights are exercisable against the controller, rather than Teckro. However, as a processor Teckro is responsible for assisting the controller when you make a request to exercise your rights.
The exact rights which are available to you may vary depending upon the legal basis relied upon by the controller to process your information.
You have the right to request information about how your information is being used. You also have the right to request a copy of the information that Teckro has about you, request its correction, or request its erasure.
If you would like to exercise your statutory data protection rights, please contact Teckro at
data-privacy@teckro.com
and we can facilitate by referring your request to your data controller.
Will we update this policy?
Our Privacy Policy Statement may change from time to time and all updates will be posted within the application.
