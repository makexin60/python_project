Effective Date:  August 23, 2024
This Privacy Policy describes how RealtimeBoard, Inc. dba Miro, including its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively,
Miro
and also referred to as
our
,
us
and
we
) collects, uses and discloses information from or about an identified or identifiable person, including information that we can associate with an individual person (“
Personal Data
”), as well as any choices you have with respect to your Personal Data.
1. Applicability of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Miro’s online collaboration tools and platform, including the associated Miro mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “
Services
”), miro.com and other Miro websites (collectively, the “
Websites
”) and other interactions (e.g. customer support, the Miro Community, etc.) you may have with Miro, including the processing of any messages, text, files, images, video or audio recordings, or other content submitted through our Services (collectively, “
Customer Content
”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with our Services (“
Third-Party Services
”), or any other third-party products, services or businesses.
You, the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) controlling the use of the Services (“
Organization
”) and any associated Customer Content, and any individuals who are granted access to the Services by an Organization (“
Users
” and, collectively with you and an Organization, “
Customer
”) are also bound by the the
Terms of Service
or the
Master Cloud Agreement
, as applicable, and any product-specific Terms (together, the “
Customer Agreement”
).
If you have any questions about specific Organization settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Organization you use. If you have received an invitation to join an Organization but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.
2. Identifying the Data Controller and Processor
Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data. Whether Miro or Customer is the controller or processor of Personal Data depends on the type of data used and the purposes for such use.
Customer is the controller for all Customer Content that is also Personal Data. As the controller, Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to an Organization, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove information and otherwise apply its policies to the Services. As the processor for Customer Content, Miro processes Customer Content that is Personal Data only on Customer’s request and in accordance with Customer’s written instructions, including the applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, Customer’s use of the Services, and as required by applicable law. For more information about how Customer Content is processed (such as how your Personal Data is processed, the purpose and legal basis for processing, and your data subject rights), we refer you to the relevant Customer’s privacy notice.
Miro is the controller for Services Data as defined in Section 3.
3. The types of Personal Data we collect
Your Personal Data is provided by you, obtained from third parties, and/or created by us when you use the Services.
Customer Content.
Customers routinely submit Customer Content to Miro when using the Services.
Services Data.
Miro also collects, generates and/or receives the following types of Personal Data, other than Customer Content, through and in connection with Miro’s provision of the Services (the “Services Data”):
Organization and account information.
To create or update an Organization account, you or the relevant Customer (e.g. you or your employer) will supply Miro with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. We may also receive your email address and name from Slack or other organizations with whom our platform has integrations through which you may sign up to use our Services.
Billing information.
Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services may provide Miro (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
Service metadata.
When a User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated to provide additional context about their use of the Services. For example, Miro logs the Organizations, boards, people, features, content and links that you view or interact with, as well the types of files shared and any Third-Party Services that you use.
Log data.
Like most websites and services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services, recording this information in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, your browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and language preferences.
Device data.
Miro collects information about devices accessing the Services, including the type of device, operating system used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Services Data often depends on the type of device used and its settings.

Miro may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent provided by your device.
Third-party data.
Miro may receive data about organizations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters relevant to our business from parent corporations, affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners, or other third parties that we use to make our own information more useful.

Marketing and communications Data.
Miro may obtain marketing information, including your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.

Email performance data.
Miro uses a ‘clear image’ (gif) in email communications in order to track engagement and performance metrics. Much of this data is aggregated and does not contain Personal Data. If you wish to turn off this tracking, you can do so by turning off images in the email itself.
Third-Party Services data.
A Customer may choose to use Third-Party Services. If Customer enables Third-Party Services, Miro may access and exchange Customer Content and Services Data with the Third-Party on Customer’s behalf, in accordance with our agreement with the Third-Party Services and any permissions granted by the Customer (including its User(s)).

Call data.
Our Customer Success team may record video or telephone calls with Customers for the purposes of training and quality assurance. You will be notified of this when a recording is made, and can request that Miro does not record these calls.
Additional data provided to Miro.
If you use Miro’s AI features pursuant to our Terms of Service, Services Data also includes data associated with your interaction with these technologies.  We also receive Services Data when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as when you request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Miro.

The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the Personal Data that we already have.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period). If we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.

Denying you goods or services.
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.

Effective Date:  August 23, 2024
This Privacy Policy describes how RealtimeBoard, Inc. dba Miro, including its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively,
Miro
and also referred to as
our
,
us
and
we
) collects, uses and discloses information from or about an identified or identifiable person, including information that we can associate with an individual person (“
Personal Data
”), as well as any choices you have with respect to your Personal Data.
1. Applicability of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Miro’s online collaboration tools and platform, including the associated Miro mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “
Services
”), miro.com and other Miro websites (collectively, the “
Websites
”) and other interactions (e.g. customer support, the Miro Community, etc.) you may have with Miro, including the processing of any messages, text, files, images, video or audio recordings, or other content submitted through our Services (collectively, “
Customer Content
”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with our Services (“
Third-Party Services
”), or any other third-party products, services or businesses.
You, the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) controlling the use of the Services (“
Organization
”) and any associated Customer Content, and any individuals who are granted access to the Services by an Organization (“

2. Identifying the Data Controller and Processor
Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of Personal Data. Whether Miro or Customer is the controller or processor of Personal Data depends on the type of data used and the purposes for such use.
