The Apps
What we say on this page is only about the Apps named below.
FOR GROWN UPS:
This Policy is effective as of the Last Updated date posted above and applies only to information collected by Hasbro from users of the following Mobile Apps and any other mobile app published by Hasbro which links to the Policy.
Beyblade Burst
Twister Air
If your App is not named above, we'll tell you about how we use your info somewhere else. If it is someone else's app, you should check out what they say about their app and how they use your info.
FOR GROWN UPS:
This Policy does not apply to any other information collected by Hasbro through any other means. For clarity, this Policy does not apply to any of Hasbro’s websites; Hasbro’s other mobile apps that do not link here; Hasbro’s other online services (e.g., social media channels); or any apps, websites, or online services maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.
Your use of any mobile app, website, or online service created or maintained by another company is subject to such other company’s applicable privacy policies and terms of use, and we encourage you to read the third-parties’ privacy policies and terms of use before submitting personal or other information or using that mobile app, website, or online service.

Your Info
We get some info about the smart device you use to play our Apps (we call this Device Info – more on this below) and how you like to play with the App (we call this Game Info). We get this in a way that means we can't directly tell who you are in real life. This is because we try hard not to get personal info that could easily identify you like your name or your address), and we try to use your personal info in a way that keeps your info safe.
If you live in the EU or the UK, you can click
here
to find out how we use your info. If you live somewhere else, we tell you about this below.
"
Device Info
" is:
•
the type of device used (like an iPad or a phone);
•
numbers we link to your device ("scrambled IDs" – see more information below);
•
if you are using Android or IOS (i.e. operating system);
•
what language your device uses (e.g. is it in English or French?);
•
guessed info about where your device is (what country or time zone you are in);
•
what network you are on (like EE or Vodafone).
When an App is used for the first time, we create a random alphanumeric code referred to as a “scrambled ID” (such as a "Swrve Device ID") which will relate to that App.
The scrambled ID is generated from a temporary random alphanumeric code called an "install ID" and a so-called advertising ID.
These elements come from your particular mobile device and operating system, but the elements themselves are not collected or transmitted to us or anyone else — only the newly-created scrambled ID is collected and used in connection with Device Info and Game Info.
In addition, due to the way in which the
scrambled
ID is generated, it is not possible for us or anyone else to work out (i.e. "reverse engineer") your original device or advertising ID from the
scrambled
ID.
This means that once the
scrambled
ID has been generated, we are no longer able to directly identify a specific individual in the real world from that identifier.
The creation of the
scrambled
ID only occurs the first time the App is opened and is capable of connecting to the Internet and not again unless the App is uninstalled and subsequently reinstalled.
The
scrambled
ID is unique to your particular advertising ID. If you delete our Apps from your device and then install or reinstall one of our Apps again for the same device, the
scrambled
ID will be likely be the same, unless you have also changed your advertising ID in your device settings. If you get the same App for different devices, the
scrambled
ID on each device will be different, even if the same person uses the same App on different devices. The
scrambled
ID in one App does not share with, or “know” about, a
scrambled
ID on another device or platform.
However, if you download multiple Apps on one device (i.e. you already have one App on that device and you download a different App on the same device), they may share the same
scrambled
ID.
We do not generally use analytics to compare
scrambled
IDs between Apps; however we do use it to: (i) distinguish one user from another (for counting purposes); (ii) to understand what parts of our Apps are being used; and (iii) to ensure that our Apps are appropriately secure and protected.
We do not use
scrambled
IDs in order to treat users any differently, to segment our audiences, to target advertisements or push notifications, and we do not routinely collect anything that could be used in connection with the
scrambled
ID in order to directly identify the user in the real world.
Back to Top
Our App uses Device Info (like guessing its country) to make sure you get the right App in the right language, and to help you use the App and tell you things you might want to know about your App or toy and to help us fix problems with the App like bugs, should they arise.
FOR GROWN UPS:
Hasbro will collect the device type, the device's operating system (like iOS or Android) and language setting, the network carrier that your device uses (e.g., Verizon, Vodafone, EE, Orange), the
scrambled
ID (so long as the device connects to the Internet) and will guess the country (from the network info used by the device). Hasbro uses this information to work out which version of the App to install on the device, and in which language (e.g., if the device language is set to French, then the French version would be delivered), to provide the user with a suitable App, for performance of our contract or for our legitimate business interests in delivering and maintaining our Apps.
Back to Top
Do we need to use this Info?
We only collect and use the info that we've told you about here and only for the reasons we have told you.
We only collect the info that we need for those reasons.
Sometimes, if you still don't want us to use this info, you may need to stop using or uninstall the App.
FOR GROWN UPS:
In this Policy we describe the types of personal info we collect and why we need it.
In some circumstances, you may still decide that you do not want us to collect and use this info in the way that we have described.
If we can provide you with the App functionality without this info, we will let you know and give you the option to choose not to provide us with this information.
However, sometimes we cannot provide the App without this personal info and if you decide that you still don't want us to collect and use it, you will have to uninstall and not use the App.
Toy Scanning Activity
With the Beyblade Burst App, you can use the camera on your device to view a special design or “code” on your toy to get more stuff for your game. That's a Toy/Code Scan.
            We use the scan only to give you that stuff in the App and it does not save a picture anywhere. The App doesn't send a photo to us or anyone else and we don't use the scan for anything else. We do get told that your App did a Toy/Code Scan and the stuff that it unlocked, but that's it.
FOR GROWN UPS:
The Beyblade Burst App may also access the device’s camera to scan a code from one of our branded toys and/or from other promotional materials, which is noted in the “Toy Scanning Activity” column of the chart above.
For clarity, this code scan information may be used by Hasbro to, for example: unlock an in-game character, or unlock an in-game item (e.g., an in-game character accessory or improvement/enhancement to show game progression).
The fact that a code was scanned is sent to us with the scrambled ID and the name of the virtual item unlocked.
Scanning Activity
The camera on your device is used to scan the color of the Twister Air toy bands to register the player on screen. It’s part of the calibration process. The players wear the bands on ankles and wrists, and then either sit (only showing arms with wrist bands) or stand (showing all limbs and bands) in front of the camera, being instructed to position themselves the right way for calibration.
You can take videos and save them on your device. But our App doesn't send the video to us or anyone else.
FOR GROWN UPS:
Hasbro apps gives users the ability to take video clip recordings with audio and visual effects and save them locally to the user’s mobile device; however, these video clips are not shared with users through the app and are not collected or shared by us. Nor do we encourage you to share these with others.
We don't get or use photos, recordings or videos on your device.
FOR GROWN UPS:
We do not get sent, or have access to, the images in the device’s image library or audio or video recordings in the device's audio or video libraries.
We do not use the camera on the device for anything else and we do not use any other features or functions of the device unless necessary in using the App (e.g., photos above).
Our Mobile Apps do not take screen shots of activity on the device or perform similar activities.
All Apps can access wi-fi for updates and periodically may send Device Info and Game Info to us.
3.
Who Can See Info from the App?
We let other people and companies see Device Info and Game Info, to help us keep the App going and make it more fun.
We might have to use info from our App for other good reasons. For example, to protect you, us or someone else, or if the law or police make us use it for something. We can’t imagine that could happen with the info we use, but if it does, we’ll tell you about it if we can.
FOR GROWN UPS:
We do not share your personal information with third-parties other than as described in this Policy
.
We only share your personal information with third-parties as follows:
a)
With our group companies, vendors, consultants and other service providers or partners who are working on our behalf on the Apps and need access to your information to carry out their work for us. You can find a list of our group companies [here]. These entities (including those mentioned below) have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us, and not to use your personal information for any purpose other than as described in this Policy or as required or permitted by applicable law.
b)
When we believe it is necessary or appropriate to:
(i) comply with applicable law or regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests of competent legal authorities;
(ii) exercise, establish, defend or protect the rights and property of Hasbro and our employees, agents, users and other third-parties, including to enforce our agreements, policies and the Terms and Conditions of Use for the applicable Mobile App and protect against fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Mobile Apps or our products; and
(iii) protect your vital interests or those of any other person or to protect the safety of Hasbro, our users or any third-party; and in connection with, or during negotiations of, any actual or proposed merger, sale of company assets, bankruptcy or reorganization, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, provided that we inform the buyer it must use any of your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Policy.
c)
With your consent, to any other person.
Key vendors, consultants and other service providers or partners:
We use a service provider, such as Swrve, to assist us in gathering analytics and statistical data in connection with the Mobile Apps (the Device Info) and to help us to display ads in some Apps.
We use Microsoft Power BI (Microsoft Corp.) to provide a dashboard for Hasbro employees to generate reports from the aggregated Device Info and Game Info.
We use cloud services hosted by Amazon Web Services a/k/a “AWS” (Amazon Web Services, Inc.) to store content like videos and ads to display in our Apps and Game Info.
For some Apps we use YouTube to store and send Hasbro-curated videos for display in the App from Hasbro's YouTube channel, but we have made efforts to design this so that Google does not receive any information from the App other than the information needed to send the video, as we only use the YouTube API to provide the raw video feed that we control on our own YouTube channel (i.e., we are able to disable hyperlinks to other videos or webpages, or even indicating that the videos are coming from our YouTube channel, prevent the display of advertising, whether pre- or post-roll or around the video frame, and prevent the setting of web browser cookies or beacons on your App or device from YouTube using this method).
For multiplayer games we use Exit Games's Photon Cloud online multiplayer gaming platform. Match stats associated with your Multiplayer ID are sent to our AWS storage for purposes of keeping the results of matches for you and other players in your App and displaying progress in leaderboards to you and other players.

Where Is Info from the App Kept?
We limit the info we get to Device Info and Game Info, we try hard not to get personal info that shows who you are in the real world (like your address).
But if you want to know, we store Device Info and Game Info in the United States as well as other countries where we are (and where the companies that help us are). If we decide to keep the Game Info somewhere else, we'll make sure that is allowed.
FOR GROWN UPS:
We strive not to collect any personal information that allows us to directly identify a user individually, as described above.
We keep the Device Info and Game Info from all Apps in the United States, and also other countries where we have other offices or where our service providers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. However, we have taken safeguards to require that any personal information we may collect will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. These include implementing the controller-to-processor and controller-to-controller modules of the
European Commission’s
and the
UK Secretary of State's
Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies. These clauses require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA and the UK in accordance with European Union and UK data protection law, respectively.

How Long is Info from the App Kept?
We limit the info we get to Game Info and Device Info, we try hard not to get personal info that shows who you are in the real world (like your address). But in case you want to know, we generally get rid of all your info after we no longer have a need for it.
FOR GROWN UPS:
We strive not to collect any personal information that allows us to directly identify a user individually, as described above.
We retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and in accordance with our retention policies, as applicable, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable laws and/or regulations.
For Beyblade Burst, once the short player matching session is over, data sent to the Photon Cloud is destroyed (except if there was a connection error, then the data is kept for problem solving purposes for 14 days). After a match, game stats including win/loss etc. and Multiplayer ID are sent to Hasbro and retained for 90 days.

Note to Parents
If you're not 16 years old yet, please ask your mom or dad to look at this bit.
FOR GROWN UPS:
Hasbro has developed the Mobile Apps to be an enjoyable experience for users, including those under 16. Please discuss this Policy with your children who are under 16 so that they will better understand how to use the Mobile Apps and what information they may be asked to provide when using the Mobile Apps. Hasbro believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Mobile Apps will inform choices and decisions about how to use the Mobile Apps and will better protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
Hasbro takes the protection of children's privacy very seriously and is committed to compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
”), a US law designed to protect kids online along with other global data protection laws that apply. We also encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children's privacy and online experience at all times. Except as otherwise outlined in this Policy, we do not collect personal information from our users.

You Have Rights About Your Info & Can Complain
We make every effort to prevent us from being able to directly identify you in the real world from any of the personal info we collect about you.
Because of this, we are not able to retrieve or delete Game Info or Device Info about you, because we are not able to link your Game Info or Device Info to any information we hold about you (so, we can't find it!).
However, if you are worried about how we use your personal info, or if you have any questions, we will do everything we can to help you. If you think we have your personal info, get your mom or dad to ask us about the next bit (your "rights"):
You have "rights" under some laws about your info. This means you can make us do some things with your personal info or stop us doing some other things with your info, and you can complain if you don't like what we're doing with your info.
We have tried very hard to limit the information we get about you to Device Info and Game Info.
But if we have any of your personal info and you're in a country that has these rights (such as the UK or an EEA country), you can ask us to:
Tell you what info we have about you and what we do with it
Delete your info
Fix your personal info if it's wrong
Stop us doing some things with some of your personal info
Not use your personal info while some other things are being sorted out
Take your personal info away from us and send it to someone else
Not show you some marketing ads
Stop us using your personal info where previously you or your parent consented but you or your parent don't consent any more.
Some of these rights only apply in particular cases.
You also have the right to complain to an organisation called a Data Protection Authority.
If you want to ask us about any of these things, just see below on how to reach us.
If you want to understand more it might be good to ask your mom and dad to help you and explain all this.
FOR GROWN UPS:
Reviewing, Updating, or Deleting Your (or Your Child’s) Information:
As previously mentioned, except as otherwise noted in this Policy we do not collect personal information that allows us to directly identify our individual users. However, if you have any questions on how we collect and use your and/or your child’s personal information, you may contact us using the details below. We will be happy to honor your request.
If you are a resident of the United States, you can legally request access to, or deletion of, any personal information we have collected about your child under 13, and revoke any consent with respect to their information. However, as noted above, we do not typically collect or maintain any directly identifiable information about minors under 16. Certain additional state-specific rights are addressed below.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or the UK, and if we do have any personal information that allows us to identify you (or your child), then the following data protection rights apply:
If you wish to
access, correct, update or request deletion
of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “
How to Ask Us a Question
” heading below.
In addition, you can
object to processing
of your personal information, ask us to
restrict processing
of your personal information or
request portability
of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “
How to Ask Us a Question
” heading below.
You have the right to
opt-out of marketing communications
we send you at any time.
You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “
How to Ask Us a Question
” heading below.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.
For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
We will respond to requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Keeping Your Personal Info Safe
We try not to get any of your personal info in a way that means we know who you are in the real world. But we do things meant to keep safe any personal info and Device Info that we might get.
FOR GROWN UPS:
We strive not to collect any identifiable personal information, as described above. However, Hasbro has established policies in an effort to protect any personal information it may have against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. For example, Hasbro strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to personal information. Hasbro also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.
Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Hasbro will notify users of a data breach affecting any of their personal information that Hasbro may have, as necessary in accordance with applicable law.

State-Specific Privacy Disclosures and Rights
These additional disclosures currently apply only to personal information concerning individuals who reside in California or Virginia, and starting July 1, 2023, also include individuals who reside in Colorado or Connecticut. We anticipate expanding these disclosures and rights to residents of additional states in the future.
The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”) and privacy laws in the other states referenced above (collectively, “State Privacy Laws”) provide consumers additional rights to access, correct or delete their personal information (subject to certain exceptions), as well as the right to opt out of the selling/sharing of personal information, third party targeted advertising, or certain other activities as described further below (to the extent applicable).
NOTICE OF COLLECTION
In at least the past 12 months, we or our service providers have collected the categories of personal information described above in this Policy in connection with the Services, and as enumerated in one or more State Privacy Laws, that includes the following in connection with the Apps:

We will endeavor to confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days.
We may require specific information from you to verify your identity before processing your request, and we may send you a confirmation email that you must respond to before we process the request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request. Due to our privacy-protective practices, as described above, in many instances we will not have sufficient personal information (e.g., name, email) that would enable us to verify your identity and complete a request to access, correct or delete any information. We aim to complete requests within 45 days, and if needed we may extend the response by another 45 days.

Hasbro does not engage in these activities with regard to our Apps covered by this Policy.
AUTHORIZED AGENT
You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly with you.
APPEALS
If we deny a privacy request, you may appeal the decision to us at
DPO@hasbro.com
. To the extent possible, please describe the basis for your appeal and if there is any specific personal information that concern you. We will endeavor to provide a prompt response. If we deny your appeal, you can raise concerns with your state’s Office of the Attorney General.
MINORS

RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any of your rights, and we do not discriminate against anyone for exercising such rights.
NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVES (GENERALLY)
We do not generally provide a loyalty program or other financial incentive in return for the collection or use of personal information with regard to our Apps covered by this Policy. In the event we engage in a limited-time marketing event or promotional offer that includes a registration or other collection of personal information, we will disclose the benefits and terms of that promotion at the time of collection.
California Residents

We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us. If you provide us with information regarding another individual, you represent that you have that person’s consent to give us his or her information and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this policy.
Information We Collect Automatically From You.
When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about your visit (collectively, “Online User Activity”). When you visit our websites, the personal information we collect is your computer's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which we use for the support of our internal operations. Other information we and our service providers may collect includes your operating system, access times, browser type and language, country, and the URL of the website you visited before navigating to our Services. If you access our Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your device make and model, mobile carrier, operating system version, language your device is set to, mobile web browser type and version, the country in which you are using your device, and non-personal analytics and statistical data regarding use of the websites (e.g., downloads, number of users, sessions, frequency of use, retention, territories, and in-game events).
To collect this Online User Activity, we use various technologies, including the following:
Cookies:
Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. In addition, when you view a video on our Services, we may set a "flash cookie" (sometimes called a "flash object") on your computer or device. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see
"What are my information choices?"
below.
Clear GIFs:
Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.
Log Files:
Log files record website activity on our Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used our Services, which pages of our Services they've visited, and other similar data.
Do Not Track (DNT) Signals:
Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may associate the information we collect from these technologies with other personal information that you provide for the purposes described in this Policy.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you connect with us on a social media service or log into a Hasbro account using a third-party “social sign on”, we may have access to certain information from that party, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.
Third-Party Website Technology and Analytics
Third party technologies include analytics services and software to help us understand how users access and use the Services. These tools and services use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies on our Services to track website traffic and performance. The data collected typically includes Online User Activity such as IP address, Internet Service Provider, web browser, the time spent on web pages, the links clicked and the products or advertisements viewed on various pages. We use this information to improve our Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and to count visits.

4. How does Hasbro handle children’s information?
NOTE TO PARENTS
Hasbro has developed its Services to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages, including those under 13 (“Child(ren)”). Please discuss this Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Services. Hasbro believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Services will inform choices and decisions about how to use the Services and will better protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this section.
Hasbro is committed to compliance with the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)
, a federal law designed to protect Children online. We take Children's privacy seriously and encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their Children's privacy and online experience at all times. As shown on our website, we are Privacy Certified by ESRB for Kids, which indicates that our Services were subject to a third party review to ensure they restrict the collection and use of personal information in compliance with COPPA.
Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information
Hasbro may collect and store certain persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.
Hasbro may collect and store other personal information about Children if this information is submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child. If a Service is directed to children under COPPA, we may ask users to verify their dates of birth before collecting any personal information from them. Those users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.
Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a Child when submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child: first and/or last name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the Child's mailing address and/or telephone number when necessary to respond to an inquiry or fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a Child such as the Child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the Child's personal information. Please refer to the sections entitled
"What information is collected from me?"
and
“How does Hasbro use my information?”
for further details on the information we collect and the tools we use to collect it.
When registering an account to play online games, we may collect a username and password from registrants for the purpose of saving that user’s gaming activities (e.g., pets collected in Littlest Pet Shop). Once collected, we may also use the game play information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy. Please note that we use aggregated (i.e., non-personal) information for analytics purposes.
Additionally, we are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a Child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the Child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the Child's phone number) to allow the Child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it, even with parental consent. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all users’ personal information, please see our section on
"Security"
.
Disclosure of Children's Personal Information
We follow our standard policy
("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?")
for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about Children.
Parental Access
A parent who has already given Hasbro permission to collect and use his or her Child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child's personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection or use of the Child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact
Hasbro Consumer Care
.
Please be sure to include your Child's name and email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site on which your Child is registered. Alternatively, you may contact us at:

The Services may offer third party social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook widget), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features. The third party provider may also collect other information in connection with your use of their features, including your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.
Linking to Third Party Sites
To provide relevant information not found on our Services, to facilitate online shopping, and to allow you to interact with other websites and/or applications in which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites), Hasbro may provide links to or embed third-party applications that allow login from our Services to third party websites.

7. Security and Retention
Hasbro has established a security program with administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. For example, Hasbro strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to users’ personal information. Hasbro also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.
Hasbro retains your information based on a number of factors, including (i) for business purposes such as for as long as your account is active, as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services, and for the other purposes we use your information as described above, and (ii) as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.
Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Hasbro will notify users of a data breach when Hasbro determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law, and you agree to receive such notice via email where possible.
