WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT
We collect from you the following
data:
a.
Information you provide us
directly.
When you use our apps, we collect the information that you
provide us directly:
Photos.
When you use "AI Hug Video Maker," we may
collect photos you provide directly. These are necessary for creating the
videos. Without access to your device's camera or photo library, you cannot
upload photos or create videos.
Facial features.
·
The app uses advanced artificial intelligence to process
facial features in the photos for fun and creative video generation.
·
Due to limited processing resources on mobile devices, we
use cloud servers for video processing.
·
Photos are uploaded to cloud servers temporarily and cached
only for the duration of video processing.
·
All uploaded content is automatically deleted from our
cloud servers within 24 hours after processing.
b.
Cookies and similar
technologies.
Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use
cookies — tiny pieces of code that remain in your device after you have visited
any websites and online services. When you use that website or application for
the next time, these pieces enable their owners to provide you with information
customized for your needs.
We use cookies and other technologies
for authentication purposes only. When you access the app or content, session
cookies are used. These expire once the session is closed.When you use the
Services, we may also use technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local
storage to collect information about how you use iface and provide features to
you.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use information that we collect
about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information,
to:
Provide you
     with the App and its contents, and any other information, products or
     services that you request from us.
Fulfil any other purpose for
     which you provide it.
Notify you when
     App updates are available, and of changes to any products or services we
     offer or provide through it.
The usage information we collect helps
us to improve our App and to deliver a better and more personalized experience
by enabling us to:
Estimate our
     audience size and usage patterns.
Store information about your
     preferences, allowing us to customize our App according to your individual
     interests.
Recognize you
     when you use the App.
Face Data Collection and Usage
Our app collects user-uploaded photos
containing faces to generate entertaining videos. The collected photos are:
·
Temporarily stored on
our secure servers for up to 24 hours.
·
Shared with a trusted
third-party AI API provider for video processing.
·
Permanently deleted from
both our servers and the API provider’s systems within 24 hours after
processing.
We do not collect or analyze any
additional biometric data. The photos are not shared with any other third
parties and are solely used for the intended processing purpose.
Content Moderation and Safety
Our app uses an AI-powered content
moderation system to ensure a safe and appropriate user experience.
Specifically:
·
Our AI model
automatically detects and blocks sexually explicit, violent, or inappropriate
content
. If a user attempts to upload an
image containing such content, the AI prevents video generation and notifies
the user.
·
We do not store, share,
or process any inappropriate content.
Any flagged images are
immediately discarded, and no video is created.
·
Our AI features are
designed solely for entertainment purposes
and
do not generate deepfake or non-consensual content.
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We may disclose aggregated information
about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or
device, without restriction.
In addition, we may disclose personal
information that we collect or you provide:
To our
     subsidiaries and affiliates.
To contractors, service
     providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who
     are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information
     confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to
     them.
To a buyer or other successor in
     the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization,
     dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Company's assets,
     whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
     similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Company about
     our App users is among the assets transferred.

     you provide it.

     law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or

     Company, our customers or others

legal obligation (taxation, accounting, audit) or in order to maintain safety
and data backup settings, prevent fraud or other malicious acts.
