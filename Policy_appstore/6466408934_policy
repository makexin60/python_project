3. What data do we collect?
Personal data
is any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
Whenever we collect, store, use, disclose or delete your personal data, this is referred to as processing your personal data. As a website user, visitor or customer or app user, we will process different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
Identity
data
– data which identifies you including your name, title, user name, date of birth and gender.
Contact
data
– your contact details such as your billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.
Purchase
data
– information concerning the products you have purchased from us including how frequently you purchase from us, whether you have used any discount or gift card codes, or other offers, which products you have purchased, how much you have spent with us and information relating to your membership of our members reward programme, Represent Prestige, including how many Represent Prestige points you have collected and which rewards tier you are in.
Security
data
– for your security we keep an encrypted record of your login password.
Customer Service
data
– information relating to your interactions with our customer service team by email, phone, WhatsApp, on-line chat or by post or by submitting an enquiry form on our website or contacting us via our social media pages or via our app. For example, information you provide when you make a general enquiry, ask us for product advice or in the unfortunate case that you need to complain to us.
Financial
data
– data we collect if you purchase a product from us such as your bank account and your payment card details.
Review
data
– information you provide to us when you review our products or services such as via Trust Pilot or when you provide feedback to our customer services team.
Marketing
data
– data which we capture when you sign up to receive our newsletter or other marketing communications, including your preference regarding us contacting you this way, opt-out data and any vouchers or other offers we have sent you as well as data on how you respond to and interact with our marketing communications.
Technical
data
– electronic information which is automatically logged/stored by processing equipment including details of the device(s) you use to access our services, internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, country and telephone code where your device is located, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access our websites or apps or open our emails.

We also collect, use and share
aggregated data
such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will
not
directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your
Usage
data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We do not collect any
special categories of personal data
about you (such as information about your health, race, political opinions, religious beliefs or sexuality). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
4. When do we collect your data?

5. How and why we use your personal data
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. The legal basis will vary depending on the reason we are collecting your personal data. Sometimes we might rely on more than one legal basis when we process your personal data depending on why we are using your data. Please contact us as any time if you need more information about how we are using your personal data and which legal basis we are relying on.
We have summarised below the legal basis we rely on to use your personal data and examples of how this works in practice:
Where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract
We will need to process your data when you purchase products from us in order to process and deliver your order including taking payment from you. We are likely to process your
Identity
,
Contact
,
Purchase
,
Customer Service
and
Financial
data on this basis.
We may also rely on contractual necessity to operate, manage and run your membership of Represent Prestige, our loyalty programme where you are rewarded for purchases.
Where we have your consent to do so, subject to your right to withdraw consent
We may send you marketing communications by email or by SMS if you have subscribed to receiving these communications from us in this way. Our marketing email provider uses a pixel contained in our emails to track how you interact with them (such as whether they are delivered, opened, marked as spam or unsubscribe) and which features you click on and to collect
Technical
data (such as the type of device you use to open them and your location). This means that we can send you email content that’s more relevant and tailored to you. If you want to opt-out of email tracking at any time, then you can opt-out of receiving marketing emails.
We may rely on the ‘soft opt-in’ to send you marketing emails and/or texts without asking for your express opt-in consent. For further information on the soft opt-in, please see the section on legitimate interests below.
You can easily opt-out of our marketing emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link or by contacting us by email at gdpr@representclo.com. You can easily opt-out of our marketing texts by texting ‘STOP’ at any time.
We will also obtain your consent to collect certain
Usage
and
Technical
data when we ask you to consent to cookies. Please see the section headed “
Cookies
” below for more information.
We will get your opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing.
Where we process information on the basis of consent, if at any time you want us to stop processing this information, you can withdraw your consent.
Where it is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to
We are subject to legal and regulatory obligations that require us to process your personal data, for example, anti-money laundering obligations, compliance with subpoenas and government requests, and consumer contracts legislation. We are likely to process your

6. Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we wish to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
7. If you fail to provide personal data
Where we need to collect personal data from you in order to comply with our legal obligations or to perform a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the relevant contract (for example deliver your products or process your payment). In this case, we may have to cancel the relevant contract.
8. Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Your personal data is available to authorised personnel of Represent who need access to the information in order to fulfil their duties. All Represent personnel who have access to your personal data will only process your personal data on our instructions and they shall be subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We also have place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Unfortunately, however, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website or app; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
9. How long will we keep your data?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In relation to marketing consents, we may ask for your updated consent from time to time if we have not heard from you in a while to check that you still want to receive our emails or texts. If you decide to opt-out we will keep a record of this alongside your email address or other contact details to ensure that we do not send you marketing communications going forward.
In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
We shall not have any liability whatsoever to you for the deletion of personal data in accordance with our data retention policy.
10. Who do we share your data with?
We may share your personal data with the following third parties in order to perform a contract with you, comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, in our legitimate interests of conducting our business or where you have consented:
Third parties who support our website and our app and provide other business systems such as Shopify, our ecommerce provider and Venn Apps, our app provider.

We require all our data processors to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our data processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
In some instances where we share data with third parties, such as HMRC, those third parties will also be controllers of your personal data. We shall not be responsible or liable for the way in which other data controllers hold or process your personal data. Please contact those third parties for further information regarding how they will use your data. We shall only share your personal data with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

https://www.nofraud.com/end-user-privacy-policy
.
11. International transfers
If we need to transfer your data outside of the UK or EEA, we ensure your data receives essentially equivalent protection as if it were being processed inside the UK or EEA by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by UK adequacy regulations (in the case of data transfers from the UK) or EEA adequacy regulations (in the case of data transfers from the EEA).
In some instances, we will take steps to ensure that the recipient has an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal information and that appropriate and suitable safeguards are in place to comply with data protection legislation. Please contact us if you want further information on and a copy of such arrangements.
In the case of data processed by Shopify, our ecommerce provider, details of the data transfers which they make outside the UK can be found at:
https://help.shopify.com/pdf/cross-border-whitepaper.pdf
12. What are your rights over your data?
You have certain rights in respect of the personal data that we process about you (where we are the data controller because we determine the purpose and means for which that personal data shall be processed):
the right to request
access
to your personal data that we hold and to receive certain information relating to that data;
the right to ask us to
rectify
inaccurate data or to complete incomplete data;
the right to receive or ask for your personal data to be
transferred
to a third party in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you);
the right to request the
erasure
of personal data if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed or if you have successfully objected to processing (note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request);
the right to
object
to how we process your personal data in certain circumstances, including the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes;
the right to
restrict
processing of your personal data, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it; and
where we are processing personal data relating to you on the basis that we have your consent to do so, you may
withdraw
your consent at any time (this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
We may ask you to verify your identity if you make a request to us to exercise any of the rights set out above. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
