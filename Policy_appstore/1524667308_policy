How we use and manage your data
Key Information
Tevalis respects your right to privacy. We put in place security measures for your personal data and manage your personal data in accordance with applicable data privacy regulations. Please note that Tevalis is the Data Controller of your personal data. The principles set out in this Privacy Notice apply to all instances in which Tevalis receives your personal data as a Data Controller for the purposes described in this notice. Those purposes are processing of data to participate in the various activities available on this website or as mentioned below.
If you have any requests concerning your personal data or any queries with regard to these practices, please contact Tevalis using the contact details given in Paragraph 5 below.
1. Personal data which Tevalis collects through this website and how Tevalis collects it
You can provide your personal data if you wish. We only collect personal data that YOU want to provide to us or that is needed to provide (and improve) our service to you. We collect personal data directly such as name, age, gender, address and e-mail address as well as connection and system information. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is your consent and/or any other applicable legal basis, such as our legitimate interest in engaging in commerce and offering products and services of value to you. Any consent you provide may be withdrawn at any time by following the contact methods listed in Paragraph 5. You may want to give us your e-mail address, name, telephone number etc. so that we can provide you with information on our products/Services; respond to your questions or comments. Some website functionality may be unavailable to users who do not provide their data, or who do not consent to the use of Cookies and similar technologies on this site. Additionally, if you choose not to provide your personal data, we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or with other support or responses.
2. Tevalis security measures
Tevalis takes security measures in line with data protection regulations. Tevalis has security measures in place designed to prevent data loss, to preserve data integrity, and to regulate access to the data. Only authorised Tevalis employees and authorised employees of our Third-Party service providers (a list of such providers is available on request) have access to your personal data. All Tevalis employees who have access to your personal data are required to adhere to the Tevalis Privacy Notice and all third-party service providers are requested by Tevalis to ensure that any of their employees who have access to your personal data have signed non-disclosure agreements. In addition, contracts are in place with such third -party service providers acting as data processors for Tevalis that have access to your personal data, to ensure that the level of security required in your jurisdiction is in place, and that your personal data is processed only as instructed by Tevalis.
3. How Tevalis uses your personal data
Your personal data will only be used for the purposes for which you provided it to Tevalis, as indicated to you at the time you provided your personal data. It will also be used to administer, support and obtain feedback on the level of our services, to help prevent breaches of security, the law or our contract terms. It may also be disclosed, including a disclosure to entities based outside the European Economic Area (EEA), to third parties (as part of the information generally contained in business) in the event of a sale of the business, or a reorganisation of the business, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or applicable regulator.
4. Who Tevalis discloses your personal data to and why
Tevalis will never share your personal data with any Third-Party (i.e a party other than an entity within the Tevalis Group) business organisation that intends to use it for their own purposes, other than as required by law. Tevalis, may transfer or disclose your personal data to another data controller in the Tevalis Group to be used for similar purposes, at its discretion, and you hereby consent to such transfer or disclosure. If your personal data is transferred or disclosed to another data controller within the Tevalis Group, that other data controller shall have the same rights and obligations with regard to your personal data as Tevalis. With your consent, Tevalis may share your personal data with Third-Parties (i.e. parties other than entities within the Tevalis Group) such as those who assist us in providing the products and services and who perform technical operations, but only in the strictly limited circumstances set out below:
Our Third-Party Data Processors (service providers such as our fulfilment and activation partners and digital agencies, hosting providers, data storage providers and other technical partners) who help us administer this website, or process the data submitted to it, may have access to your data. Some of these business partners may be located outside the country where you accessed this website.
5. Your rights
You have the right to ask Tevalis to provide you with all the information it stores on you. If you wish to access your personal data you can contact the data controller. You have the right to ask Tevalis to rectify, block, complete and delete your personal data, to restrict its use, and to port your data to another organisation. You have the right to request additional information about the handling of your personal data. You also have the right to object to the processing of your data by Tevalis in some circumstances and, where we have asked for consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. Additionally, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at: Tevalis ltd, Bridgehead Business Park, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU13 0DH.
There are exceptions to these rights, however. For example, access to personal data may be denied in some circumstances if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if Tevalis is legally prevented from disclosing such information. In addition, Tevalis may be able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent, where Tevalis can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement to process your data.
6. Countries your personal data will be sent to and why
Tevalis is a global company and your personal data may be transferred across international borders. It may be transferred to countries that have different levels of data protection laws to the country from where you submitted your personal data. Tevalis (as Data Controller and Data Exporter) has, where local data protection regulations so require, put in place security measures for the export of personal data from its jurisdiction. Where local data protection regulations so require, Tevalis has made arrangements with entities receiving your personal data such as Tevalis Group or Third-Party Data Processors, that they shall ensure that security measures are in place and that your personal data is processed only in accordance with EU Data Protection laws. If data is transferred from within the EEA to a jurisdiction outside the EEA, it is done so under a Data Transfer Agreement, which contains standard data protection contract clauses. The European Commission has adopted standard data protection contract clauses (known as the Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We use Model Clauses when transferring personal data outside of Europe. If you wish to know more about international transfers of your personal data, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at Tevalis ltd, Bridgehead Business Park, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU13 0DH.
The server that makes this website available may be located outside the country from which you have accessed this website. The provider of this website is bound by a contract that ensures your data is managed in accordance with EU Data Protection laws and that it acts only on Tevalis instructions and implements all technical measures necessary on an ongoing basis to keep your personal data secure.
