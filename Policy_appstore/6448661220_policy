Anti-virus
application.
On
all
computers

Codeway's
information
technology
infrastructure, a periodically updated anti-virus application is installed.
Firewall.
The
data
center
and
disaster
recovery
centers
hosting
Codeway
servers
are
protected
by
periodically
updated
software-loaded
firewalls;
the
relevant
next
generation
firewalls
control
the
internet
connections
of
all
staff
and
provi
de
protection
against
viruses
and similar threats during this control.
5
VPN.
Suppliers
can
access
Codeway
servers
or
systems
through
SSL-VPN
defined
on
Firewalls.
A
separate
SSL-VPN
identification
has
been
made
for
each
supplier;
with
the
identification
made,
the
supplier
only
provides
access
to
the
systems
that
it
should
use
or
is
authorized to use.
User identifications.
Code
way employees'
authorization to
Codeway systems
is limited
only
to
the
extent
necessary
by
job
descriptions;
in
case
of
any
change
of
authority
or
duty
,
systemic authorizations are also updated.
Information
security
threat
and
event
management.
Events
that
occur
on
Codeway
servers
and
firewalls,
are
transferred
to
the
“Information
Security
Threat
and
Event
Management”
system.
This
system
alerts
the
responsible
staff
when
a
security
threat
occurs
and allows them to respond immediately to the threat.
Encryption.
Sensitive
data
is
stored
with
cryptographic
methods
and
if
required,
transferred
through
environments
encrypted
with
cryptographic
methods
and
cryptographic
keys
are
stored in secure and various environments.
Logging.
All transaction records regarding sensitive data are securely logged.
T
wo-factor authentication.
Remote
access to sensitive
data is al
lowed through at
least two-
factor authentication.
Penetration
test.
Periodically
,
penetration
tests
are
performed
on
servers
in
the
Codeway
system. The
security
gaps
created
as
a
result
of
this
test
are
closed
and
a
verification
test
is
performed
to
show
that
the
relevant
security
gaps
have
been
closed.
Besides,
Information
Security
Threat
and
Event
Management
System
automatically
performs
penetration
tests.
T
est results are recorded.
Information
Security
Management
System
(ISMS).
At
the
ISMS
meetings
made
within
Codeway
,
the
topics

in
the
control
forum
are
audited
monthly
by
the
director

In
order
to
increase
the
awareness
of
Codeway
employees
against
various
information
security
vio

authorized
persons.
Adequate
security
measures
(for
situations
such
as
electric
leakage,
fire,
deluge,
thievery
etc.)
are
taken
based
on
the
nature
of the environment where sensitive data is stored.
Backup.
Codeway
periodically
backs
up
the
data
it
stores.
As
a
backup
mechanism,
it
uses
the
backup
facilities
provided

sensitive
personal
data.
If

personal
data
is
required
through
email;
such
transfer
is
done
through
(i)
encrypted
corporate
email

In
the
event
that
the
personal
data

a
result
of
attacks
