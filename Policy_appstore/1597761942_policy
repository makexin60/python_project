Privacy Policy - BorderLeap
This policy is used to inform users regarding our policies with
the collection, use, and disclosure of data collected by the app,
Patterned.  In general, we do not collect
any personal information, but please review this policy for more detail on what
kind of information may be collected, used and/or stored.
If you choose to use the app, then you agree to the collection
and use of information in relation to this policy. The information that we
collect is used for supporting game services and improving the app. We will not
use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
Policy.
Data Collection and Use
The app collects non-identifiable gameplay data to send to Apple iCloud for saved game state and to Apple Game Center for achievements.  We (BorderLeap, LLC) do not store any of this data, but it is sent to these Apple services (iCloud and Game Center) for storage and use.
Examples of saved game state data sent to Apple iCloud include
which puzzles have been played, and the user’s progress in each one of those
puzzles.  Examples of achievements data
sent to Apple Game Center (“AGC”) include achievements awarded such as
“Tutorial Completed” or “25 Patterns Solved”. 
Data for each achievement’s percentage completed is sent to AGC along
with the achievement that is being awarded. 
These examples are explained further later in this policy.
Patterned collects non-identifiable gameplay data from players of all ages as the game is available to players of all ages through the Apple Arcade service.  The basis for this collection of information is to support the internal operations of the app as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”), which purpose is a legitimate interest under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
iCloud Data for Saved Game
State
If the user is signed into iCloud on a device, the app will sync
saved game state data with the user’s iCloud account. This data will be
regularly retrieved and updated within the app as to keep all devices signed
into the same iCloud account able to play puzzles from the same approximate
starting point. The app does not associate device UUID or any other means of
device identification with saved game state.
As an example, if a puzzle is played on an iPhone, and the user
places approximately 30% of the pieces on the board, then continues play later
on an Apple TV, then if both devices are signed into the same iCloud account,
progress for that puzzle on the Apple TV will automatically “fast-forward” to
the 30% completion point.  At any point
during gameplay, the user can easily elect to reset progress on any puzzle and percentage
completion for that puzzle will be reset down to 0% completion on iCloud.
Disabling Sync In-App
In the app’s settings menu, there is an option to enable or
disable “Sync”.  This feature merely
prevents data from being uploaded and downloaded from iCloud, so that level
progress does not update on that device. 
A user signed into iCloud will remain signed in on that device.
Game Center for
Achievements
If the user is signed into the Apple Game Center service on a
device (“AGC”), AGC will supply the user’s gamePlayerID, username and other
game-specific data such as achievements awarded and status of each achievement.
The gamePlayerID and username are not used in the app.
As the user plays the game and is awarded achievements, this
achievement data (achievement ID and percentage completion) will be sent to AGC
to update the user’s AGC account. 
Furthermore, in the app, status for all achievements can be accessed and
shown.  When this occurs, achievement
data for all achievements is downloaded to the device and shown in the app.
As an example, if the user is signed into AGC, when the app loads,
they will be shown a popup from AGC in the app welcoming them to the game.  For a first-time user, when the tutorial is
completed, players will be awarded the “Tutorial Completed” achievement.  When they solve their first pattern fully,
they are awarded the “First Pattern Solved” achievement.  As a player progresses through the game, they
will come across hidden animations and will receive an “Animation Found”
achievement for each one.  There are a
number of other achievements in relation to finishing puzzles, finding
animations and completing puzzles without mistakes.
Security
We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting all
information we obtain from a user. But remember that no method of transmission
over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable,
and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you
are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify
you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These
changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
