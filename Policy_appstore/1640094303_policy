Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following
statement will help you understand how TopStarLabs deals with the
personal identifiable information (‘PII’) you may occasionally provide
to us via Internet .
Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download
our applications. To be specific, we do not require the consumers to
get registered before downloading the application, nor do we keep
track of the consumers’ visits of our application, we even don’t have
a Server to store such PII.
TopStarLabs will never collect and store any face data when you use
our application. And any PII can not be shared with any third parties.
The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you
personally decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a
bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation are strictly
limited to your name, email address and your survey response only.
In above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used for
contacting you and improving our services. We will never use such
information (e.g. your name and email address) for any other
purposes, such as to further market our products, or to disclose your
personal information to a third party for commercial gains.
It should be noted that whether or not to send us your feedback or
bug report is a completely voluntary initiative upon your own
