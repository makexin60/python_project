This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, store, and use your personal data when you browse our Uniqlo websites including uniqlo.com and any of our related applications (the "Site"), shop with us or otherwise provide your personal data to us. These terms will apply regardless of how the Site is accessed and will cover any technologies or devices by which we make the Site available to you.
This Policy provides you with details about the types of personal data that we collect from you, how we use your personal data and the rights you have to control our use of your personal data. You will find specific details about our processing purposes below.
You must read this privacy policy carefully and we recommend that you print and retain a copy for your future reference. By browsing or otherwise using this Site, you must have read this Policy.

For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the “GDPR”), UNIQLO EUROPE LTD is the “

” (as defined in the GDPR) of the personal data, when it determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
In addition, under the GDPR:

‘

If you do not provide the personal data marked with an asterisk, this may affect the goods and services that we can provide.
WHERE THE DATA IS TRANSFERRED AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We will treat all your Personal Information as confidential. Information about our customers is important and protecting your privacy is essential to us. We do not share your personal data with any third parties other than for the limited purposes specified below.

When we share personal information with our parent company or other entities within our Group, we follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
We work with teams, systems, and suppliers in the EU, UK, India and Japan. Your data may be transferred to, accessed in, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), this data will always be held securely and in line with the requirements of any applicable regulations regarding data protection.
Third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Where we transfer personal data to third parties outside the EEA, we ask them to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical, organisational and security measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the EU regulation and ensure the protection of your rights as data subject. We also rely on the European Commission Adequacy decisions, or we may ask them to enter into contracts based on the template adopted by the European Commission according to Article 46.2 of the GDPR (Adequacy decision and model clauses adopted by the EU Commission are available via this
page

When working with third parties, we only provide them with personal information they need to perform their services and we ask them to commit to use your data only for specific listed purposes. We will always use our best efforts to make sure that these third parties will keep your personal data secure and confidential.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personal information for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Policy.
HOW LONG DO WE STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it to achieve the purpose for which it has been collected or to meet our legal obligations. Details about retention are explained below for each purpose.
We might keep some personal data for a longer time than presented to comply with legal or regulatory obligations (e.g. to meet our obligations linked with invoicing) or to protect our legitimate business interests (e.g. to bring a claim before the Court).
WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS APPLIED ON THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
When you provide us some of your personal information, you still have the following rights that you can apply directly on your account or by contacting us. When defined on the below purposes, there might be some specifics when you apply for your rights. You have the following rights:

If you have contested the accuracy of your personal data, processing shall be restricted for a period enabling us to verify such accuracy,
