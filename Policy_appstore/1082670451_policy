Controller and data protection officer
The protection of your personal data is of particular concern to us at Freeletics. Therefore, we comply with the legal requirements when we collect and process your personal data. Below you will find extensive information about the scope and purpose of collecting data.
Principle of data use
In principle, our website can be used without providing personal data. The use of individual services and offers (Freeletics Training, Freeletics Running, Freeletics Gym and Freeletics Nutrition [in short ‘Freeletics Apps’]) on our website and in our apps can entail divergent regulations which in this case are explained separately below. The legal basis for data protection can be found in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
When you access our website or Apps, some information, such as IP address, is transferred. You are also providing information about the end device used (computer, smartphone, tablet etc.), the browser used (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox etc.), time of visit to the website, the so-called referrer and volume of data transferred.
We cannot use this data to identify an individual user. We only use this information to determine how attractive our offers are and to improve their performance or content, if necessary, and make their design even more appealing to you.
Please bear in mind, however, that in the case of a static IP address, personal identification is possible by RIPE query in individual cases, although we do not perform this. Nevertheless, this website is accessible for both static and dynamic IP addresses assigned.
Collection and processing of personal data
We only collect personal data if you provide it to us, for example when you contact us, in particular by registering a Freeletics account, placing an order, requesting information or publishing personal data in our Freeletics Apps in your profile or in the feed. We use the personal data you provide only to the extent that your data is necessary for rendering or processing our services.
To protect your data from unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration or disclosure, we use encryption for transferring and storing any kind of data.
We store your data for as long as is necessary to achieve the intended purpose or until you delete your account or for as long as legal retention periods require data to be stored. Your data is subsequently deleted in accordance with legal requirements or processing is restricted.
In the case of use purely for information, i.e. if you do not register or send us information another way, we only collect personal data which your browser transfers to our servers. If you want to view our website, we collect the following data, which we require for technical purposes in order to show you our content and guarantee stability and security (legal basis is a legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
In the context of the balance of interests in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we have considered and weighed our interest in website and app provisioning and your interest in data protection compliant processing of your personal data. As the data below is technically required for the provision of our service in order to offer you our services and also guarantee stability and security, in particular protection against misuse, we have reached the conclusion that, with a state-of-the-art oriented data security guarantee, this data can be processed whereby appropriate consideration will be given to your interest in data protection compliant processing.

Registering a Freeletics Account
Using our login system, you can create a Freeletics account for yourself that you can use to log in to all of our services (Freeletics Training, Freeletics Running, Freeletics Gym, Freeletics Nutrition, and Freeletics Essentials). In the process, we use cookies – small files – on your browser in order to identify you. All data that you enter into your account is stored within a database of Freeletics GmbH with the provider named below. Some of our services are only accessible if you have set up your Freeletics account. This includes Freeletics Training, Freeletics Running, Freeletics Gym, and Freeletics Nutrition. We will request the following data when registering (some of it is required). In addition, you must take note of our Data Protection Statement, as well as accept our General Terms and Conditions of Business and Withdrawal Policy.
After entering your data, you will receive a registration link sent to the email address you entered. The registration link is valid for 7 days. Only after you have confirmed your registration via this link, your Freeletics account will be created and you can access our services. If you do not confirm your registration, your personal data will be deleted immediately after the link has expired. If you still want to register with Freeletics after the 7 days, we kindly ask you to register again.

Registering Google
We also offer you the opportunity to create your Freeletics account using your Google account, or to link your Freeletics account to your Google account. You can register or log in to Freeletics using your Google account if you simply use Google instead of the other options while registering your Freeletics account. You will then be forwarded to Google (where you must be logged in or require an account) and receive an explanation of which of your data we need from Google, namely your public profile information such as first and last name, gender, and the email address you are using there. This information is required for identification purposes in order to create a secure Freeletics account for you. Your Google account and your Freeletics account will be permanently linked using your email address. We store your email information in-house and will send you information using this address as needed. We can also tell that you have logged in using Google. As soon as you log in to Google, you can log in to Freeletics. We will not submit any information on you to Google without your consent.
Important: We do not record your Google login data in any way, and cannot post anything to your Google profile without your having expressly consented to this.
You can learn how Google handles privacy settings using Google's

You can also register and log in using the “Apple Login” function from your Apple account. When you log in with your Apple ID for the first time, the app will prompt you to enter your name and your email address so that an account can be set up for you. We store your email information in-house and will send you information using this address as needed. You will not be tracked by Apple and a profile of you will not be created while you are using the “Register with Apple ID” function. Apple only collects information required for you to log in and manage your account.
You will stay logged into our app automatically as long as you stay logged in on your device.

you can find more information on the Apple login.
Data collection, processing and use in the context of Freeletics Service
Community Profile
You need a Freeletics account in order to use our Freeletics Apps. The data collected for this purpose has already been explained above. To provide you with the best Freeletics experience possible, our approach is partly based on publishing specific information relating to our users within the Freeletics community, i.e. even your information. We are going to introduce our program to you in more detail below so that you can decide for yourself whether and which data you want to publish. This introduction includes the following data in particular which is visible to other users:
public profile (photo, first name, surname, training location, motivation, Freeletics level)
fitness (progress, desired objective, skills)
training information (duration and type of training unit, total number of training sessions, notes, photo)
social media profile (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
food intake (meal type, notes, photo)
followed by/follows (persons who follow the user, persons followed by the user)
You become visible in Freeletics Apps with the data in your public profile. This information helps other users to find you in Freeletics Apps. At the same time, other users can see your name and surname (if provided), your training location, your motivation and your profile photo and they can recognize you using this information if necessary. You have already agreed under our General Terms and Conditions of Business that upon beginning your Freeletics journey and provided that you make no changes to your privacy settings, all Freeletics users will be able to view your profile, your training data, your posts, etc., without special consent. This is designed to make it easier to follow you and/or support you during your journey with comments and motivation. If you do not want this anymore, you can set your privacy settings to ‘private’ at any time, which only allows select athletes to access the information referred to above.
Freeletics Apps save all your successfully completed training units or the meals you have consumed (Freeletics Nutrition only) as well as related information such as self-uploaded photos or notes. Other users can see this data and can consider them as incentive for themselves, leave comments or decide whether they want to follow you.
Moreover, our Freeletics Apps also provide users with the option to be followed (‘followed by’) to support or encourage them in their training experiences, or to compete with one another. For this purpose, users can be searched for by the name registered in the public profile. You will be notified about new followers in the mobile app and by push notification where applicable.
Consequently, some of your information is available to other users in Freeletics Apps. Our aim is that nobody is left alone with their training. Instead, users’ performance is appreciated and can become an incentive for new members.
If you do not want to make it possible to link your performance to yourself, you are free to refrain from providing any personal data on your profile or training sessions and linking your account to Facebook. Moreover, you should not save any training photos or enter any notes in this case. For this reason, we have ensured that each user can change their personal information, which can be viewed by other users, and each user is free to use their own name or a fictitious name in their Freeletics Apps.

Freeletics Coach
Personalized training and nutrition plans
When using the Freeletics app, the Freeletics Coach will continuously send you customized training and nutrition plans based on your personal information, training or nutritional preferences, as well as the units you have completed successfully. Here we use a complex algorithm to analyze, among other things, your workout performance and compare this with the workout performance of other users similar to you, in order to offer you perfectly customized training units.

“Adapt session” and Limitations
Within the “Adapt session” section of the Freeletics Training App, you may change the proposed training by providing us with more information about how you want to train. This includes restrictions with regards to time, equipment, noise or intensity. Moreover, you can exclude certain body areas, such as “upper legs”, when defining the next Coach week. We process this entry to generate training for our users, taking the limitation into account. You are able to deselect your previous choices within the “Adapt session” section of the App.
If you have sustained a serious injury and therefore cannot do any training, you can suspend your Coach for the period of your injury. You can notify our support team about your injury on a voluntary basis. This information merely serves as the basis for the relevant deferment or suspension of your Coach and is subsequently anonymized.

Analysis of location data

This data allows us to calculate distances covered at the relevant time and thereby correctly determine the end for predefined distances or determine distances covered.

Access rights
We require these access options and information to ensure the technical function of our app and to provide the services offered with the app, in particular to access your camera or your photos, to determine your running distances and your activity calories or to send you push notifications to inform you about new followers or comments. During the installation procedure or before you use the app for the first time, we request permission to access individual functions and information. We will only access these functions with your approval. You can revoke access rights manually in the settings for each operating system. You can find out how this works in the manufacturer instructions for your mobile OS. However, please note that you can only use the app to a limited extent or you cannot use it at all without the relevant approval.

Contact form
You have the option of contacting us via our e-mail address or the contact form.

Newsletter
You can subscribe to our newsletter if you want to receive regular updates or information about topics and products that are referred to in the declaration of consent. We need a valid email address for you for subscription purposes. The provision of other separately highlighted data is voluntary and will be used in order to address you personally. This will only happen if you give separate consent.
To make doubly sure that you actually want to receive information from us, we use the double opt-in procedure. Once you have subscribed, you will receive a link by email which you can use to activate the newsletter service. In other words, we will send an email to the address given when you subscribed in which we ask for confirmation that you want to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your subscription, your data will not be saved in our email dispatch tool. In addition, we save your IP address and dates of newsletter subscription and confirmation. The purpose of this procedure is to verify your subscription and, where appropriate, shed light on any misuse of your personal data.
Naturally, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. The unsubscribe link can be found in the masthead of every email or in your profile settings.
Direct Marketing
Email addresses collected when registering for a Freeletics account (via our app or our website) are used for direct marketing of our own and similar products and services (the Freeletics Coach in particular) pursuant to section 7 (3) UWG. If you no longer wish to receive direct marketing, you can refuse to allow the use of your email address at any time. This will not incur any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rate. The unsubscribe link can be found in the masthead of every email or in your profile settings. The associated processing of personal data is justified in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Alternatively, you can send us an email to
privacy@freeletics.com
.

Your user behavior with regard to the
newsletter
is tracked only with your separate consent.
The legal basis for tracking your user behavior in
emails for the purpose of direct marketing

Apple Health Kit
We use the HealthKit framework from Apple (Apple Inc., 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA; “Apple”), which provides a central storage location for health and fitness data on the iPhone or Apple Watch and – with the express consent of the user – allows apps to communicate with the HealthKit store in order to access and share these data.
If you activate the HealthKit framework in your iPhone’s or Apple Watch settings, Freeletics is able to send, with your approval, certain information, such as the calories burned by the activity, route (walking and running), as well as your workouts (start and end of training [date], training duration, type of training, indoor or outdoor) to Apple, so that you can track and display your health and fitness activity.
Only with your explicit consent, Freeletics will also process additional training information and fitness activities from third-party providers. If you have given us your consent, we will process your heart rate and workout information (workout start and end [date], workout duration, type of workout, indoor or outdoor, cadence) obtained through the HealthKit framework.
We use your health and fitness data to provide you with personalized insights, to track and display your progress, and to help you achieve your fitness goals. Freeletics will not use the information obtained through the use of the HealthKit framework for advertising or similar services.
To develop long-term fitness habits, we want to track and display your daily progress. We will store information about the date and duration of your workouts on our servers in aggregated form. This data will not be shared with third parties. Otherwise, we do not store your data on our servers;
we only process the data that Apple HealthKit provides us to display the relevant data. The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
New data attributes can be added to the HealthKit framework, which are then displayed in the product and must be approved. You can prevent Apple from accessing your data at any time, and thus prevent it from being shared, by changing your mobile device settings. You can find more information about HealthKit here: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit
Google Health Connect
We use Google Health Connect from Google (Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; “Google”), which provides a central storage location for health and fitness data on your Android phone and – with the express consent of the user – allows apps to communicate with Google Health Connect in order to access and share these data.
If you activate the Google Health Connect in your device settings, Freeletics is able to send, with your approval, certain information, such as the calories burned by the activity, route (walking and running), as well as your workouts (start and end of training [date], training duration, type of training, indoor or outdoor) to Google Health Connect, so that you can track and display your health and fitness activity.
Only with your explicit consent, Freeletics will also process additional training information and fitness activities from third-party providers. If you have given us your consent, we will process your heart rate and workout information (workout start and end [date], workout duration, type of workout, indoor or outdoor, cadence) obtained through Google Health Connect.
We use your health and fitness data to provide you with personalized insights, to track and display your progress, and to help you achieve your fitness goals. Freeletics will not use the information obtained from Google Health Connect for advertising or similar services.
To develop long-term fitness habits, we want to track and display your daily progress. We will store information about the date and duration of your workouts on our servers in aggregated form. This data will not be shared with third parties. Otherwise, we do not store your data on our servers;
we only process the data that Google Health Connect provides us to display the relevant data. The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
New data attributes can be added to Google Health Connect, which are then displayed in the product and must be approved.
The use of information received from Google Health Connect will adhere to the Google Health Connect Permissions policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
You can prevent Google from accessing your data at any time, and thus prevent it from being shared, by changing your mobile device settings. You can find more information about Google Health Connect

Strava Integration
Freeletics integrates with Strava (Strava, Inc.
208 Utah Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA) to enhance your training experience by allowing seamless synchronization of your fitness activities between the two platforms. When you connect your Strava account with Freeletics, we will collect and utilize the following data from Strava: training information such as activity type, date, duration, distance, pace, location, and other relevant metrics that you track using Strava.
Connecting your Strava account to Freeletics is entirely optional. Freeletics will only access your Strava data or will send your Freeletics data to Strava with your explicit consent. You can revoke this permission at any time by disconnecting your Strava account from the Freeletics app in your mobile device settings.
Currently, Freeletics only reads data from Strava. However, in the future, we plan to extend our integration to include sending your Freeletics data to Strava as well. This means your activities recorded on Freeletics will be automatically uploaded to your Strava account, allowing you to maintain a unified activity log across both platforms. When this feature is implemented, you will have full control over which activities are shared with Strava. You can manage these settings through your Freeletics account settings at any time.
We use your health and fitness data to provide you with personalized insights, to track and display your daily progress, to develop long-term fitness habits, and to help you achieve your fitness goals. Freeletics will not use the information obtained through the integration of Strava for advertising or similar services. We only store information on our servers that Strava provides us so we can display the relevant data about your workouts to you. This data will not be shared with third parties. The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can find more information on Strava integration

Coach+
Coach+ is our virtual fitness coach that you can interact with, ready to support you on your Freeletics journey. If you choose to utilize Coach+, it's important to understand that Coach+ utilizes third-party AI technology provided by OpenAI Ireland Ltd. (OpenAI), our LLM (Large Language Model) partner. Coach+ is only trained with proprietary data and implemented by Freeletics. When we train Coach+, we only use aggregated or de-identified fitness data. Coach+ is integrated and connected to a publicly accessible interface of OpenAI. When you ask Coach+ a question, this question is forwarded to the OpenAI interface. Coach+ responses are tailored to your inquiries and relevant information gathered from your conversation and your Freeletics metrics. Coach+ utilizes your anonymized Freeletics metrics (age, gender, bodyweight, training goal) in combination with Freeletics' scientific knowledge to help you optimize your health, fitness, and performance.
We mandate our LLM partner to solely use your anonymized Freeletics metrics for the purpose of enabling Coach+ to generate responses to your queries. We have ensured that our LLM partner adheres to a "Zero-Retention/Zero Training Policy" regarding your queries and Freeletics metrics. This means that our LLM partner will not retain any of Freeletics metrics or chat conversations received through your use of Coach+, nor will they utilize any of this data for training algorithms or LLM technology.
Your chat history and your anonymized Freeletics metrics will only be shared with OpenAI. We request that you refrain from providing any personally identifying information, such as your name, during conversations with Coach+. Before you interact with Coach+, we ask you for permission to process and transfer your questions and replies. If you decide to share health related data with Coach+ during your conversation, you consent to the processing and sharing of such data. Your chat history is not saved in your conversation thread, but you can access your last chat up to 20 minutes after the chat has ended. Freeletics will retain the history of your conversations to assess and enhance the performance of Coach+.
The legal basis for the use of this service is Art. 6 para 1 letter a GDPR and for the processing of sensitive data (Health Data) Art. 9 para 2 lit. a GDPR. OpenAI Ireland Ltd. will process Customer Data provided by Customer that originates in the EEA or Switzerland. To the extent that OpenAI Ireland Ltd transfers Customer Data to other OpenAI affiliates in jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection, it will do so on the basis of intra-group agreements that incorporate appropriate transfer mechanism provisions to protect Customer Data. Such mechanisms may include the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the EU Commission on June 4, 2021 (as may be amended, updated or replaced from time to time) (“EU SCCs”) or an adequacy decision issued by the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR.

Google Marketing Services
On our apps, we use the marketing and re-marketing services of Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) that allow us to display advertisements in a more targeted manner in order to present advertisements of interest to users. Through (re-)marketing ads and products are displayed to users relating to an interest established by activity on other apps within the Google Network. For these purposes, a code is used by Google when our app is accessed and what are referred to as (re-)marketing tags are incorporated into the app. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user’s device (comparable technologies may also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by various domains. This file records which apps users have visited, which content they are interested in and which offers have been used. In addition, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring apps, the length of the visit as well as any additional data about the use of the online products and services are stored. The IP address of users is also recorded, although we would like to inform you that within the framework of Google Analytics, IP addresses within Member States of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area are truncated.
All user data will only be processed as pseudonymous data. Google does not store any names or email addresses. All displayed ads are therefore not displayed specifically for a person, but for the owner of the cookie. This information is collected by Google and transmitted to and stored by servers in the USA.
One of the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program Google AdWords. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different conversion cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked through the apps of AdWords customers. The information collected by the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive any information that personally identifies users.
We may include third-party advertisements based on the Google Marketing Service called DoubleClick. DoubleClick uses cookies to enable Google and its partner apps to place ads based on users’ visits to this app or other apps on the Internet.

Facebook Marketing Services
We use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc., Menlo Park, California) on our website so that user behavior can be tracked after users have been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users.

Further information about the Facebook SDK within iOS can be found here:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios
. For Android, please refer to:

Facebook Custom Audience
The product Custom Audiences from Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc, 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA, 94304) is also used on the website as part of the usage-based online advertising. Basically, a non-reversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is generated from your usage data, which can be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. This is done either by placing a pixel-code from Facebook on our website or by capturing your usage behavior in our app using the Facebook SDK (see section above for a detailed description of these two Facebook services). Alternatively, we may provide Facebook with a customer list that includes the email address you provided to us when you registered. It collects information about your activities on the website (e.g. surfing habits, sub-pages visited, etc.). This allows Facebook to create a profile about your usage patterns in our app and on our website. Your IP address is stored and used for the geographical control of advertising.
As a guarantee pursuant of Art. 44ff of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Facebook has signed the EU standard contractual clauses. The legal basis for our processing is Art. 6 Para. Letter f GDPR.
The legal basis for the use of this service after setting a Facebook tracking pixel is Section 25 (1) TTDSG and for the subsequent processing of personal data Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. In the case of the provision of customer lists, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. Obviously, you can withdraw your declarations of consent for the future at any time.
If you no longer agree to us providing your data to Facebook, you can opt-out in our app-settings.
In this context, please note that Facebook may also use the data we provide about your usage behavior and your e-mail address for its own purposes.
Here
you have the opportunity to object to targeting on Facebook. Alternatively, you can contact us directly by email at
privacy@freeletics.com

Remerge
On our apps, we use the retargeting services of Remerge GmbH (Heidestraße 9, 10557 Berlin) that allow us to display interest-based advertising customized to the interests or preferences of our users as well as to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns. Remerge specializes in delivering display app retargeting campaigns for mobile app developers inside other apps that are relevant to the user. To do so, Remerge does not collect any data from the data subjects directly but receives user data from Freeletics, as we want to promote our products. Remerge then bids on real-time-bidding platforms where inventory inside other apps is auctioned resulting in the advertisement of Freeletics being delivered to the inventory. The advertisement revenues generated enable us, Freeletics, to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to our users.
Remerge is unable to combine the data they receive in a way that would enable them to personally identify users nor do they combine the data with any third party data. Remerge receives mobile identifiers such as the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA), Google Advertising ID. From time to time we might relay attribution data, which typically relates to the behavior of users inside our Apps which may include installation and first opening of an app on user’s mobile device, user interactions within an app (e.g. in-app purchases, registration), information regarding which advertisements users have seen or clicked on certain metadata, such as timestamp, device type and model, app and app version, country.
Remerge will retain your information for as long as we work with them or as needed to provide Freeletics with services, whichever is shorter. Remerge will delete personal data immediately when we inform them that the user has withdrawn consent. Remerge will however retain and use information as long as necessary to comply with their legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce their agreements.
The purpose of data processing at Remerge is to deliver targeted advertising to mobile users. This is done by analyzing user data in order to present relevant advertising that corresponds to the interests and behavior of users. The scope of data processing at Remerge may include various types of user data, such as device information (device type, operating system, device model) and usage data (interactions within apps and general usage statistics).You can learn more about the purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and utilization of data by reading Remerge’s
privacy policy
.
The legal basis for the use of this service is § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and for the following data processing of personal data Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR. If you wish to object to interest-based advertising by Remerge, you can do so using the
settings and opt-out options
provided by Remerge.
Firebase by Google
We use the Firebase service from Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) in order to derive application behavioral analytics. We use that information to see how users interact with our website and app.
Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers
numerous services for developers
. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called "instance IDs", which are provided with a time stamp. These "Instance IDs" assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior, for example by evaluating crash reports.
Currently, we use the following Firebase services for our App:
Google Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics uses the data to provide analytics and attribution information.
The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment
. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60 days, and retains aggregate reporting and campaign data without automatic expiration, unless the Firebase customer changes their retention preference in their Analytics settings or deletes their project.For Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the "Instance ID" described above, but also the advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device. For Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking.
The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and for the subsequent processing of personal data Art. 6 para. 1 letter a GDPR.
Firebase Remote Config: Remote Config uses Instance IDs to select configuration values to return to end-user devices. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
The legal basis for the use of this service is Section 25(2)(2) TTDSG in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.
Firebase Crashlytics: We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect and analyze information about crashes and errors in our app. Firebase Crashlytics helps us to monitor the stability and performance of our app and to quickly identify and fix problems.
The information collected by Firebase Crashlytics is used exclusively to analyze and fix crashes and errors in our app. This information may include the following: Device information such as model, operating system version and device ID, information about the timing and duration of crashes, information about the state of the application at the time of the crash, such as stack tracing. The legal basis for the use of this service is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG i.V.m. Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Firebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to transmit push messages or so-called in-app messages (messages that are only displayed within the respective app). A pseudonymized push reference is assigned to the mobile device, which serves as a target for the push messages or in-app messages. This service is only initialized if you have agreed to receive push notifications. The push messages can be deactivated and reactivated at any time in the settings of the mobile device. Firebase Cloud Messaging uses Instance IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase will use this information on our behalf for the above mentioned reasons.
The legal basis for the use of Firebase Cloud Messaging is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG i.V.m. Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. As a guarantee pursuant of Art. 44ff of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Google has signed the EU standard contractual clauses.
YouTube (extended data protection mode)
We also use services from YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company of Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA on our website. In so doing we use the option of “extended data protection mode” provided by YouTube. When you access a page containing an embedded YouTube video, a connection to the YouTube servers is established and the contents are displayed on the Internet page through a notification to your browser. Pursuant to YouTube specifications, in the “extended data protection mode” your data is sent to the YouTube servers only when you view the video. If you are simultaneously logged in to YouTube, this information is assigned to your YouTube member account. You may prevent this by logging out of your member account before visiting our website.
The legal basis for the use of the services is Art. 25 para. 1 sentence 1 TTDSG i.V.m. Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
For more information on data protection in connection with YouTube,

Databricks
We use Databricks (Databricks Inc, 160 Spear Street, 13th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA) for processing and analyzing data in our apps and on our website. This data provides us with information on how you interact with our apps and our website. For this purpose, we use your gender, the Freeletics ID, your BMI, your IP address as well as mobile usage data.

Cookies are used to do so. These are text files saved on your computer that allow us to analyze how you use our website. The pseudonymous usage profiles are not associated with personal data on the bearer of the pseudonym without the concerned party's express consent.

Social Plugins
This website uses social plugins from providers:
Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA)
Twitter (Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA)
These plugins normally collect your data and transmit it to the server of the respective provider.
After being activated, these plugins also record personal data, such as your IP address, and send this to the server of the respective provider where it is stored. Active social plugins also create a cookie with a unique identifier when accessing the respective website. This allows the provider to create profiles on your usage behavior. This also happens when you are not a member of the social network of the respective provider. If you are a member of the provider's social network, and if you are logged in to the social network while visiting this website, your data and visit information can be associated with your profile on the social network. We cannot influence the exact scope of the data collected on you by the respective provider. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective social network providers for more detailed information on the scope, manner, and purpose of data processing, and on your rights and setting options to protect your privacy. These can be found in the table above. They are also available at the following addresses:
Facebook
X (Twitter) (Betreiber: X Corp., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, Kalifornien, 94103, USA)
Social media fan pages
Freeletics maintains so-called fan pages with social media providers like Instagram, Facebook (both: Meta Platforms Inc. Menlo Park, California) and Twitter (Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) in order to communicate with customers, interested parties, and users who are active there, and to inform them about our products, services, and events. In doing so, the users’ data can be processed outside of the EU. The above-mentioned US providers have signed the EU standard contractual clauses and thus guarantee the observance of European data protection laws.
In the opinion of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), we are responsible, together with Facebook, for the processing of your personal data. You can find the decision of the ECJ dated June 5, 2018
here.
A
Joint Controller Agreement
exists with Facebook Ireland (Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin) pursuant to Art. 26 GDPR. Facebook Ireland pledges to assume the main responsibility in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the processing of Insights data and to fulfill all applicable obligations in the context of the GDPR with reference to the processing of Insights data (including, but not limited to Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, and Articles 32 to 34 GDPR). Facebook Ireland will also make available the essential information of this Page Insights Addendum to the affected parties. Please contact Facebook to assume your rights as affected parties. The Data Policy of Facebook can be found
here.
When using the Facebook fan page, the following data will be collected from you for the purpose of user communication and target group advertising:
user interactions (posts, likes, etc.)
Facebook cookies
demographic data (e.g., based on information regarding age, place of residence, language, or gender)
statistical data on user interactions in aggregated form, that is, without the possibility to relate the information to any particular persons (e.g., page activities, page impressions, page previews, likes, recommendations, articles, videos, page subscriptions, incl. source, times of day)
The usage of personal data for advertising purposes is of particular importance for Facebook. We use the statistics function to find out more about visitors to our fan page. The use of the function enables us to adapt our content to the respective target group. In this way, we also use, for example, the demographic information about the users’ age and location, whereby it is not at all possible for us to relate this information to persons.
In order to provide the social media service in the form of our Facebook fan page and to use the Insight function, Facebook generally saves cookies on the end device of the user. These include session cookies, which are deleted when the browser is closed, and persistent cookies that remain on the end device until they expire or are deleted by the user.
We use the Facebook Insights function for statistical evaluation purposes. In this connection, we receive anonymized data concerning the users of our Facebook fan page. As a result, it is not possible for us to trace them back to your person. For more information, you can refer to the
cookie guideline
of Facebook.
The legal basis for the use of this service is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG and for the subsequent processing of personal data your consent in accordance with Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR.

.
Transfer of data to third parties
We only pass your personal data on to third parties if:
you have given your explicit consent to this,
forwarding data is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims and there is no reason to assume you have an overriding legitimate interest in your data not being passed on,
in the event that we have a legal obligation to forward data, and
this is legally permissible and required for the performance of the contractual relationship with you.
In the case of data transfer outside the European Union, the high European level of data protection essentially does not exist. It may be the case with a transfer that an EU Commission adequacy decision in accordance with Article 45 (1) (3) GDPR is not currently in place. This means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection corresponds to the level of data protection in the European Union due to the GDPR. If the recipient is located outside the European Union / European Economic Area, we have taken the necessary measures such as signing the EU standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission, and have additionally taken appropriate security precautions.
Potential risks, which cannot be ruled out completely in connection with data transfer, are in particular:
your personal data could be processed over and above the intended purpose.
Moreover, there is a possibility that you may not be able to exercise your rights in relation to data protection, for example, your right of access, to rectification, erasure, or data portability, on a consistent basis and enforce these.
It may also be highly likely that data is processed incorrectly and in quantitative and qualitative terms, the protection of personal data fails to meet the requirements of the GDPR in full.
Your rights
Information on the rights of data subjects
Each data subject has the right of access in accordance with Article 15 GDPR, the right to rectification in accordance with Article 16 GDPR, the right to erasure in accordance with Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing in accordance with Article 18 GDPR, the right to object in Article 21 GDPR and the right to data portability in Article 20 GDPR. The limitations according to Articles 34 and 35 BDSG apply to the right of access and to the right to erasure.

This section provides additional details for California consumers about the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA“.
In addition to the rights mentioned above under “information on the rights of data subjects”, California consumers have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised their rights under the CCPA. In particular, Freeletics may not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices for goods or services, either by denying benefits or imposing penalties, provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services or threaten you with any of the above.

In the event that you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for this purpose. Please note that this withdrawal will only apply prospectively. This does not affect processing that took place prior to a withdrawal.
Information on the right to object in the case of balance of interests
If we process your personal data based on a balance of interests, you can object to such processing. If you exercise this right to object, please state the reasons why we should not process your data as we have described.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device

Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.

cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and

Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.

show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.

The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox
.
How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy
.
Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about
managing cookies in Chrome

Reddit Privacy Policy
Effective: August 16, 2024. Last Revised: August 16, 2024.
Introduction
At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters
      of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit
      (“Reddit,“ “we“ or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our
      websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services
      (collectively, the “Services“) or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a
      communication from us.
We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit.
      We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:
Reddit is a public platform.
Reddit is a public platform. Our communities are largely public and anyone can see your
      profile, posts, and comments.
We collect minimal information about you.
We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to
      just browse, you don't need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in a
      subreddit, we don't require you to give us your real name. We don't track your precise
      location. You can even browse
anonymously
. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want when using Reddit.
We only use data to make Reddit a better place.
Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our Services, which are focused on allowing
      people to come together and form communities. We don't sell your personal data to third
      parties, and we never work with data brokers.
All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries.
Privacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their data, account
      deletion, or information about our policies.
If you have questions about how we use data, just ask.
We've tried our best to make this as easy to understand as possible but sometimes privacy
      policies are still confusing. If you need help understanding this policy or anything about
      Reddit,
just ask
.
Reddit Is a Public Platform
Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an
    account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and
    freely.
When you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the
    Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the
    username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the
    content. That content and information may also be available in search results on Internet search
    engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should
    take the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting.
Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about
    your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma,
    trophies received, profile display name, about section, and social links, avatar or profile
    image, moderator, contributor, and Reddit Premium status, communities you are active in, and how
    long you have been a member of the Services (your cake day).
We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services
    with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with
    your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that
    provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data
    collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy
    policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g.,
Tumblr
,
Facebook
, and
X
).
Reddit allows moderators to access Reddit content using moderator bots and tools. Reddit also
    allows other third parties to access public Reddit content using Reddit’s developer services,
    including Reddit Embeds, our APIs, Developer Platform, and similar technologies. We limit
    third-party access to this content and require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to
    larger quantities of content. Reddit’s
Developer Terms
are our
    standard terms governing how these services are used by third parties. Please review our public
    content policy
here
for more information about how your public content is publicly available and accessible to
    anyone with access to the internet.
What Information We Collect
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services.
                      This includes:
Account information
You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account,
                        your account will have a username, which you provide or which is
                        automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be
                        related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on
                        whether you register using an email address, Single Sign-On (SSO) feature
                        (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a
                        password, we may send you a SMS message for verification purposes. We may
                        also ask you to select interests during account creation (for example,
                        history, nature, sports) to help generate a home feed for you, or to select
                        communities (such as, r/technology) to join.
When you use Reddit, you may also provide other information, such as a bio,
                        gender, age, location, profile picture, or social link. This information is
                        optional and may be removed at any time.
We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for
                        such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve
                        your experience exploring Reddit.
Non-Public Content You Submit
In addition to the public content you submit to the Services, we also
                        collect non-public content. This includes your saved drafts of posts or
                        comments, your messages with other users (such as private messages, chats,
                        and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and
                        with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos,
                        software, and tools.
Actions you take
We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.
                        This includes your interactions with the platform and content, like voting,
                        saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other
                        users, such as following, and blocking. We collect your interactions with
                        communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.
Transactional information
If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the
                        Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete
                        your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services
                        (such as Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are
                        subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will
                        collect information about the product or service you are purchasing (for
                        example, purchase dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and
                        renewal dates).
We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses, such as when you
                        purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or create a
                        Reddit Vault. However, we never store Reddit Vault private key information.
Other information
You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we
                        may collect information when you fill out a form, survey, participate in
                        Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job,
                        request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect
                      information about you. This includes:
Log and usage data
We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may
                        include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system,
                        referral URLs, device information (such as device IDs), device settings,
                        mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and
                        search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit
                        will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.
Information collected from cookies and similar technologies
We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your
                        browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar
                        technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our Services,
                        improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and
                        advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the
                        quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information
                        about your preferred language and other settings. See our
Cookie Notice
for more
                        information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you
                        can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below.
Location information
We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive
                        location information from you when you choose to share such information on
                        our Services, including via the Location Customization setting or by
                        associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate
                        location based on your IP address.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other
                      users and third parties, and combine that information with the other
                      information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or
                      interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such
                      as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and
                      combine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account
                      identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can
                      control how we use this information to personalize advertisements for you by
                      visiting the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section
                      titled “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Linked services
If you authorize or link a third-party service, such as an unofficial mobile
                        app client, to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about
                        your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services
                        may also cause the other service to send us information about your account
                        with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party
                        identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To
                        learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information
                        About You Is Shared” below.
Information collected from integrations
We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and
                        cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services,
                        including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit
                        a site that uses
Reddit embeds
,
                        we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an
                        advertiser incorporates Reddit’s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited
                        information about your activity on the advertiser’s site or app, such as
                        whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use
                        this information to personalize the Services for you as described in “Your
                        Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.
Information Collected by Third Parties
Embedded content
Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For
                        example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or
                        tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't
                        have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how
                        third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly
                        via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this
                        privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is
                        embedded.
Audience measurement
We partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn
                        demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide
                        this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to
                        recognize your device.
Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers
Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers If you use
                      Reddit Ads (Reddit’s self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com), on behalf of
                      your business or organization, we collect some additional information. To sign
                      up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information
                      about your company. Reddit may make information about your company public to
                      comply with applicable law. If you purchase advertising services, you will
                      need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also
                      require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit
                      Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service,
                      troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.
Information Collected from Reddit Pro Users
If you sign up for Reddit Pro, on behalf of yourself, your business or
                      organization, we may collect some additional information from you, including
                      your profile type, name, industry category, website, and organization size, if
                      applicable. If you request certain limited Reddit Pro features, we may request
                      additional documentation to verify your identity.
Information Collected from Reddit Program Participants and Potential
                        Participants
If you sign up to participate in a Reddit Program (for example, our
                      Contributor Program), we collect, directly or indirectly through our
                      providers, some additional information from you (such as your name, date of
                      birth, address, email, tax, government ID, and payment information). This
                      additional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and
                      compliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the
                      applicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law. Those
                      providers and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and
                      privacy policies.
How We Use Information
We use information about you to:
Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and
      settings;
Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers,
      addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our
other terms and policies
, as well as comply
      with applicable law;
Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services;
Research and develop new services;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and
      administrative messages;
Provide customer service;
Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, events, and programs, and
      provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about
      how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below); and
Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.
How We Share Information
In addition to the content that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share
    information in the following ways:
With your consent
. We may share information about you with your consent or at your
      direction. For example, at your direction through social sharing features that allow you to
      share content with third party sites like Tumblr and X.
With linked services
. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service,
      Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control
      this sharing as described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.
With our service providers
. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and
      other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their
      use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A
      few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud
      providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who
      help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services, and (iv)
      compliance providers who help us determine your eligibility to participate in Reddit Programs.
To comply with the law
. We may share information if we believe disclosure is in
      accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or
      governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law
      enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with
      prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our
Transparency Report
has
      additional information about how we respond to government requests.
In an emergency
. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent
      imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
To enforce our rights and promote safety and security
. We may share information if we
      believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement,
rules
, or
other Reddit terms and policies
, or to
      protect the rights, property, and safety of the Services, ourselves, and others.
With our affiliates
. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of
      our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
Aggregated or de-identified information
. We may share information about you that has
      been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For
      example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who
      the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.
How We Protect Your Information
We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS
        while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access
        controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information.
You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring
two-factor authentication
.
We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for
        which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business
        purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in accordance with, or as required by, any
        applicable law. For example, if you violate our policies and your account is suspended or
        banned, we may store the identifiers used to create the account (such as phone number) to
        prevent you from creating new accounts.
Your Rights and Choices
You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of
        information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also
        have the right to correction/rectification of your personal information, to opt out of
        certain advertising practices, or to withdraw consent for processing where you have
        previously provided consent. Below we explain how to exercise each of these rights. Reddit
        does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.
Accessing and Changing Your Information
You can access your information and change or correct certain information
                          through the Services. See our
Help Center
page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal
                          information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described
here
.
Deleting Your Account
You may delete your account information at any time from the user
                          preferences page. For more information, please visit our
Help Center
. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to
                          other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account.
                          Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted
                          prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you
                          first delete the specific content. After you submit a request to delete
                          your account, our purge script commences the deletion process within 90
                          days. After running our purge script, Reddit will not be able to provide
                          access to deleted data. We may also retain certain information about you
                          for legitimate business purposes and/or if we believe doing so is in
                          accordance with, or as required by, any applicable law.
Controlling Linked Services' Access to Your Account
You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and
                          revoke access to individual services by visiting your account’s
Apps page
(for third-party
                          app authorizations), the Connected Accounts section of your
Account Settings
(for Google
                          Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected X accounts), and the Social
                          links section of your
Profile Settings
.
Controlling Personalized Advertising
You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties,
                          including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit.
                          To do so, visit the Privacy section of the User Settings in your account
here
, if using
                          desktop, and in your Account Settings if using the Reddit mobile app.
Controlling the Use of Cookies
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
                          can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and
                          third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject
                          cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our
                          Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar
                          technologies are used on Reddit, see our
Cookie Notice
.
Controlling Advertising and Analytics
Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out
                          mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional
                          tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies
                          and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and
                          collection of certain information by
Google Analytics
via the
Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by
Nielsen
and
Quantcast
.
You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements
                          from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about
                          these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the
Digital Advertising Alliance
and the
Network Advertising Initiative
, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area,
Your Online Choices
.
Do Not Track
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal
                          to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
                          However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to
                          this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
                          Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you
                          the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of
                          information about you.
Controlling Promotional Communications
You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional
                          communications from us by following the instructions in those
                          communications or by updating your email options in your account
                          preferences
here
. If you opt
                          out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional
                          communications, such as information about your account or your use of the
                          Services.
Controlling Mobile Notifications
With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push
                          notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these
                          messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile
                          device.
Controlling Location Information
You can control how we use location information for feed and
                          recommendations customization via the
Location Customization
setting in your Account Settings.
If you have questions or are not able to submit a request to exercise your rights using
          the mechanisms above, you may also email us at
redditdatarequests@reddit.com
from the
          email address that you have verified with your Reddit account, or submit them
here
.
Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify
          the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address
          associated with your Reddit account. If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision
          by contacting us at
redditdatarequests@reddit.com
.
International Data Transfers
Reddit, Inc. is based in the United States and we process and store information on servers
      located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other
      countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service
      providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you
      consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the United States
      and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.
When we transfer the personal data of users in the EEA, UK and/or Switzerland, we rely on the
      Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such transfers or other
      transfer mechanisms deemed ‘adequate’ under applicable laws.
EU-U.S., UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks Disclosure
Reddit complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to
      the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by
      the U.S. Department of Commerce. Reddit has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that
      it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with
      regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United
      Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Reddit has
      certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy
      Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal
      data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict
      between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S.
      DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework
      (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
Reddit’s compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the
      U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In accordance with the DPF, Reddit is also liable for onward
      transfers to third parties that process personal information in a way that does not follow the
      DPF unless Reddit was not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage.
In some situations, the DPF Framework gives you the right to invoke binding arbitration. You
      can do this to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the
      DPF
framework
. In compliance
      with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S.
DPF
, Reddit commits to
      refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on
      the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to JAMS, an
      alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive
      timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not
      addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit
https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to
      you.
Additional Information for EEA and UK Users
If you live in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Reddit Netherlands B.V., is the controller
      of information processed in connection with the Reddit platform and this policy. If you live
      in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Reddit, Inc., is the data controller and Reddit UK Limited is
      Reddit’s UK GDPR Article 27 Representative.
Users in the EEA and UK have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of
      their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of
      processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have
      previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised as described in the “Your Rights
      and Choices section above. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local
      supervisory authority.
As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA
      and UK only where we have a legal basis for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services
      you use and how you use them. We process your information where:
It is necessary to fulfill our contract with you, including
to provide, operate, and improve the Services, provide customer support, personalize
        features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection
        interests), such as preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, enforcing
        our rules and policies, protecting our legal rights and interests, research and development,
        personalizing the Services, and marketing and promoting the Services;
You have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations.
Additional Information for California Users
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended, requires us to provide California
      residents with some additional information, which we address in this section.
In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from
      California residents, depending on the Services used:
Identifiers and account information, like your Reddit username, email address, phone number,
        IP address, and cookie information.
Commercial information, including information about transactions you undertake with us.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as information about your
        activity on our Services and limited information about your activity on the services of
        advertisers who use our advertising technology.
Geolocation information based on your IP address.
Your messages with other users (for example, private messages, chats, and modmail).
Audiovisual information in pictures, audio, or video content submitted to Reddit.
Professional or employment-related information or demographic information, but only if you
        explicitly provide it to us, such as by applying for a job or filling out a survey.
Inferences we make based on other collected data, for purposes such as recommending content,
        advertising, and analytics.
You can find more information about (a) what we collect and sources of that information in the
      “Information We Collect” section of this notice, (b) the business and commercial purposes for
      collecting that information in the “How We Use Your Information” section, and (c) the
      categories of third parties with whom we share that information in the “How We Share
      Information” section.
If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, including the
      right to opt out of any sales or sharing of your personal information, to request access to
      and information about our data practices, and to request deletion or correction of your
      personal information, as well as the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your
      privacy rights. Reddit does not “sell” or “share” personal information as those terms are
      defined under the CCPA. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information except to
      provide you the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.
You may exercise your rights to access, delete, or correct your personal information as
      described in the “Your Rights and Choices” section of this notice. When you make a request, we
      will verify your identity by asking you to sign into your account or if necessary by
      requesting additional information from you. You may also make a rights request using an
      authorized agent. If you submit a rights request from an authorized agent who does not provide
      a valid power of attorney, we may ask the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the
      agent signed permission to submit the request to exercise rights on your behalf. In the
      absence of a valid power of attorney, we may also require you to verify your own identity
      directly with us or confirm to us that you otherwise provided the authorized agent permission
      to submit the request. If you have any questions or concerns, you may reach us using the
      methods described under “Your Rights and Choices” or by emailing us at
redditdatarequests@reddit.com
.

Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us.

If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.

This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.
