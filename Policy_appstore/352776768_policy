Racing TV Privacy Policy
Last updated:
17/12/2024
The
www.racingtv.com
website and all pages within it (collectively the "Website"), is owned and operated by Racing TV Limited ("us", "our", "we"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of users of this Website. This Privacy Policy explains what information we may collect about you, how we will use it and the steps that we will take to ensure that such information is kept secure.
We are a controller (also known as a data controller) in respect of your personal data, which means we are responsible for determining how we use your personal data. As such, we are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office ("ICO") and our registration number is Z9297632. Although we are a controller, we understand that ultimately it is your personal data and therefore we will only process it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This Website may have links to other websites. Third party websites should have their own privacy policies and we recommend that you read such policies to find out how your personal details are protected. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these third party websites nor how they will process your personal data.
Please note, we may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time so you should review it regularly. If we make material changes we will notify you.
1. Personal Data We Collect
1.1 When you use this Website we may collect details about you which you provide to us in order to access and use our services, such as your name and contact details).
1.2 We may also collect other information which does not identify you individually but may identify information about you and your device, such as your computer's IP address.
1.3 We may also collect information which you provide to us when you contact us.
1.4 We may also receive information about you from third parties, such as other members of our group and third parties, including Pay-TV operators and betting partners.
Please note, we do not store the financial details (credit or debit card numbers and billing information) of our subscribers.
We also do not collect any special categories of personal data about you or personal data about you relating to criminal convictions and offences (also known as sensitive personal data). The only exception to this is where you provide this to us unprompted, in which case we will delete such personal data unless there is a specific reason why you have given us this information.
2. Purposes For Processing Your Personal Data
2.1 In accordance with data protection laws, we will only process your personal data where we have a lawful basis for doing so. In respect of your personal data, these bases are: (i) where it is necessary to provide services to you under the performance of the contract we have with you; (ii) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal or regulatory obligations; (iii) where you have given your consent; and, (iv) where it is in our legitimate interests to process your personal data, provided that none of these prejudice your own rights, freedoms and interests.
2.2 We process your personal data for the following purposes and in accordance with the following lawful bases:
3. Who Do We Share The Information We Collect With?
3.1 We may disclose aggregated and anonymised data of which your personal data was originally a constituent part. This information will not contain your personal data and will not be capable of identifying you.
3.2 We may disclose your personal data to other members in our group.
3.3 We may appoint certain third party processors to process your personal data on our behalf. These third parties will only process your personal data in accordance with our instructions and we will ensure that adequate measures are in place to ensure that your personal data is processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and kept secure at all times.
3.4 We may also share your information with third parties in the following situations, to the extent permitted by law:
• Where we are required to do so by law, court order or governmental authority.
• Where we are owed a debt and need to recover that debt.
• Where we receive a request from the police or similar law enforcement agency.
• If we believe doing so is necessary to protect the rights, property, security, or safety of us, our staff or the public.
• Where required to defend ourselves legally.
• Where necessary to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations.
• While negotiating or in relation to a business transaction, such as a merger, change of control, sale of assets, or bankruptcy.
3.5 As mentioned above, we and/or our selected bookmaker partners may contact you with information about offers/promotions, products and services that might be of interest to you (but only if you have consented to receive such marketing). Our selected bookmaker partners are 888sport, bet365, Betfair, Betfred, BetVictor, Betway, Coral, Grosvenor Sport, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, Sky Bet, Spreadex, Unibet, Virgin Bet, William Hill and the Tote. If you have consented to receiving such marketing communication by ticking the marketing box when you registered but you no longer wish to receive such communications, you can click on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any of the marketing emails.
3.6 As part of your membership we may also ask if you would like to receive marketing from the racecourse partners. If you give us your consent, we will share your information so that our racecourses can contact you directly with offers and promotions. If you later decide you no longer wish to receive marketing from a racecourse, you can click on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any of the marketing emails.  Note that where we share your information with a racecourse on this basis, the racecourse acts as an independent controller of the information and the racecourse will be responsible for any processing of that information that it carries out.
4. The Inside Angle
Racing TV also operates The Inside Angle which is a service that is offered for the purpose of providing you with details of racing offers, betting tips and promotions. By its nature, if you wish to receive this service, you are specifically signing up for the purposes of receiving  email marketing concerning racing offers and promotions, designed to help you get the most out of your racing experience.  These e-mails may contain third party offers but you will not receive marketing directly from third parties unless you have consented to that.
If you no longer wish to receive communications about these offers, you should close your Inside Ange account.
5. Data Security
We have adopted measures to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered. Where information is transferred to a third party, that third party will be required to keep your personal details secure.
6. Transfer of Details Overseas
Given the global nature of the Internet, use of the Internet to collect and process personal details may involve the transmission of data internationally. Currently we do not process your personal details outside of the UK and Europe. However, if we do so in the future, we will always ensure that any third party to whom your personal details are transferred will take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal details, including standard contractual clauses pursuant to European Decision 2010/87/EC and those that are certified with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
7. Updating Your Details
It is important to ensure that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date. Therefore we request that you notify us as soon as any of your personal information which we hold changes. You can update the personal details we hold on you by e-mailing us at:
privacy@racingtv.com
.
8. Your Rights
8.1 You have the following rights in relation to your personal data:
• A right to access your personal data held by us (often known as a subject access request).
• A right to receive certain personal data in machine-readable format.
• A right to have inaccurate personal data rectified.
• A right to object to processing where lawful basis is that it is in our legitimate interests, but please note that we may still process your personal data where there are other relevant lawful bases or where we have compelling grounds to continue processing your personal data in our interests which are not overridden by your rights, interests or freedoms.
• A right to have certain personal data erased where it is no longer necessary for us to process it, where you have withdrawn your consent pursuant to the paragraph below, where you have objected pursuant to the paragraph above, where your personal data has been unlawfully processed, or where erasing your personal data is required in accordance with a legal obligation.
• A right to withdraw your consent where consent is the lawful basis on which we process your personal data.
• A right to request an explanation of the logic involved where we make decisions about you solely through automated means.
• A right to complain to the ICO.
• A right to object to any direct marketing.
8.2 If you are unsure about your rights you should contact us or the ICO. You can learn more about your rights here.
8.3 If you would like to exercise any of your rights then you can do so by contacting us. Please be aware that whilst we will try to accommodate any request you make in respect of your rights they are not absolute rights. This means that we may have to refuse your request or may only be able to comply with it in part.
8.4 Where you make a request in respect of your rights we will require proof of identification. We may also ask that you clarify your request. If we receive repeated requests or have reason to believe requests are being made unreasonably we may not be required to respond.
9. Retention
We will retain your personal data for the period necessary for us to provide you with our services and to comply with our legal and regulatory responsibilities. Thereafter we may retain it for a period of time in so far as we deem it still necessary for us to process your personal data. Where it is no longer necessary for us to process your personal data we will delete it.
