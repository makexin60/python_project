For further information on our use of cookies, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
What personal data do we collect?
ASSA ABLOY collects and stores personal data (for example your name, address, email, telephone number, country) that you submit in order to obtain information from us. This personal data helps ASSA ABLOY to process your request for information.
ASSA ABLOY also collects and stores personal data that you submit (a) as part of your account details (if applicable) and/or (b) in connection with your requests for, or purchase of, products on our website (where such functions exist). Such information includes contact and delivery details as well as financial information concerning your online product payments.
How and why will we use your personal data?
In addition to the above mentioned use and purposes, we use your personal data to administrate and improve this website, for our internal records, for statistical analysis about the use of the website and (if applicable), to complete your product orders and/or to contact you regarding sales and as a part of our customer relation procedures.
ASSA ABLOY’s collection of personal data is based on the need to carry out the processes stipulated above. To the extent that ASSA ABLOY uses the personal data to improve this website or for analysing statistics, the basis for collection of data is ASSA ABLOY’s legitimate interest to conduct such improvements and analysis. Since no sensitive personal data will be processed and the processing is limited, ASSA ABLOY has concluded that its legitimate interest to conduct the improvements and analysis takes precedence over your privacy interest.
Who and where is your personal data transferred to?
We may transfer your personal data to the following categories of recipients to the extent necessary in order to complete the processes stipulated above or if legally required:
Government agencies and institutions;
Other legal entities within the ASSA ABLOY group; and
Our service providers such as legal counsel or IT hosting providers relevant to the service.
These third parties may only use your personal data according to our instructions.
Some recipients are located in countries outside the EU/European Economic Area (EEA). As in some cases these countries have a lower level of protection than that within the EU/EEA, when transferring personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to ensure a sufficient level of protection for your personal data. These standard contractual clauses can be found via the following link:
https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm
.
We take measures to protect all personal data transferred to a third party, or to other countries, in accordance with applicable data protection laws and as stated above.
For how long will we store your personal data?
ASSA ABLOY stores the personal data as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the data has been collected, unless we may, or are obligated by law to, store the data for a longer period of time. ASSA ABLOY will delete your data when we are no longer required by law to retain it or when it is no longer necessary for the purposes of providing the service. Upon termination of the service the data will be deleted after three (3) months of such termination.
Your information and access rights
You have the right to request access to the personal data relating to you. This includes the right to be informed whether or not personal data about you is being processed, what personal data is being processed, and the purpose of the processing. You also have the right to rectify or add personal data if the personal data is inaccurate or incomplete. As soon as we become aware of any inaccurate personal data being processed, we will always correct such personal data as soon as possible and notify you accordingly.
Right to erasure
You may request that your personal data be erased for example in the following situations:
If the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected;
if you object to the processing of personal data where we do not have an overriding legitimate interest;
if the processing is unlawful; or
if the personal data has to be erased to enable us to comply with a legal requirement.
If you have any questions about your right to erasure, please contact the ASSA ABLOY Divisional DPM (Data Protection Manager). Please note that we may reject your request if the processing is permitted or required according to law or any other relevant legal ground.
Right to object
You are entitled to object to our use of your personal data that we base on our legitimate interest. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that overrides your interests or rights and freedoms or if we need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Right to restriction
You can request us to restrict the processing of your personal data in the following situations:
If the processing is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
if you withdraw your consent for use of data that we base on your consent;
if you believe the personal data may not be correct;
if you believe that the processing is unlawful; or
if we process your personal data based on our legitimate interest, where we do not have an overriding interest in relation to your privacy interest.
Right to Data Portability
If you request access to personal data about you that you yourself have provided and if the personal data is being processed automatically, you may request that the data is provided in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format and you may also request that the personal data is transferred to another controller, if this is technically possible.
