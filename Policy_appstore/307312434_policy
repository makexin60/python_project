Listen to the Liturgy of the Word!
Use the audio controls on the bottom of the Mass Readings page to listen to the audio version of the Liturgy.  It is a great way to reflect on the day's Liturgy!  Listen while driving or lying in bed.  Great option for those with vision impairments.  Lectors have also found this invaluable in preparing for the Mass.
