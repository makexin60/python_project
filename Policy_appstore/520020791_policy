Privacy Notice
GCash takes your privacy very seriously. We work hard to protect your personal information. We do this in a way that follows international standards and the laws of the Philippines.
This privacy notice tells you how we handle your personal information. Our goal is to be clear about what we do and why we do it. We always try to do things in the right way. Here, we explain how we collect, use, share, keep, delete, and protect your information. We'll also explain how you can control what happens to your information.
‍
What is GCash?
GCash is a digital wallet that makes your financial and lifestyle tasks easy. Thanks to our partners, you can pay bills, send money, borrow cash, donate, plant trees, shop online, and buy things using your GCash App.
‍
‍
You can learn more about what you can do with your GCash App on our
website
.
Why do we have your personal information?
To confirm your identity (Know-Your-Customer or KYC Information)
Before we can create a digital wallet for you and let you use our partner services, we need to know who you are, as required by law. We also need to keep track of transactions and report any suspicious activities to financial regulators. This is because of rules against hiding the real source of money that may have been obtained illegally (money laundering).
To provide our financial and lifestyle services
We collect your personal information so you can enjoy our services easily and instantly. For example, when you pay your bills through your GCash App, we ask for your name, account information, contact information, and payment method. We collect these details so the company or institution you're paying can apply your payment to the correct bill or account.
We also look at how you use our services to see if you can get special deals from us. We look at things like if your account is set up right, if you keep enough money in your GCash account, and how often you use our services like paying for bills, investing money, saving money, and getting insurance. We also see if you pay your loans early or on time, and how you use credit. Looking at these will allow us to calculate your GScore. To learn more about GScore, please see the
GScore FAQs
.
To personalize our products and services
We collect and analyze your personal information to tailor our services just for you. By understanding what you like and need, we can recommend products, customized services, and personalized features that make your experience even better.
To carry out product and market research
We may use your personal information to find trends and patterns in the market so that we can create new products and improve our services. For example, we offer fair lending, affordable investments, accessible insurance, and other services to promote financial inclusivity for all Filipinos. We were able to introduce these products because we study your needs.
To manage risk and prevent potential fraud and crime
We do risk analysis and fraud prevention to protect you, our partners, and our business. For example, to stop someone else from taking over your GCash account, we may collect and look at your facial image, transaction histories, and other personal information. To learn more about our DoubleSafe security feature, please visit our
website

Who do we share your personal information with?
We partner with different government agencies and private businesses to provide a wide range of financial and lifestyle services. Sometimes, we need to securely share your personal information with them to give you the services you asked for:
GCash Affiliates:
Different companies affiliated with GCash work together to provide one of our financial and lifestyle services. For example, if you decide to apply for a loan, the personal information you provide may be shared with our lending partner, Fuse Lending, Inc. (FLI).

G-Xchange Inc. (GXI) is the main company that runs GCash. GXI has related companies like FLI and BlockG Virtual Assets, Inc. (BlockG). Another company called Globe Fintech Innovations, Inc. (GFI or Mynt) owns GXI.
Financial institutions and credit investigation agencies:
To consistently provide you with high-quality services, we may share your personal information with other trusted financial institutions. This helps us deliver the services you requested, confirm your identity, evaluate your creditworthiness, manage risks, prevent fraud and crime, and more.
Partners:
GCash may collaborate with different businesses to offer you a broad range of financial and lifestyle services. For instance, if you use your GCash App to pay your bills, we may share your personal information with the billing company you chose. If you participate in a promotion with our partners, we may share your promo subscription and redemption records with them. To know who our partners are, please visit our website.
Service Providers:
We also share your personal information with trusted service providers who assist us in making our services seamless and efficient. They help us in various ways, such as answering your questions, analyzing information, managing risk, preventing fraud, processing payments, and more. They play a big role in making sure the GCash App runs smoothly for you.
Fraud and crime prevention partners:
We are dedicated to protecting you and other GCash users from fraud and other crimes. By sharing some of your personal information, we contribute to a safer and more transparent financial system, protecting you and the broader community.
Law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, and courts:
GCash may share your personal information with law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, courts, and other public authorities. We will only do this if required by law or to protect our rights, prevent fraud, and ensure the safety of GCash users and the public.
Changes within GCash:
If GCash joins with another company, or if another company buys us or our assets, we might have to share your personal information with that company. If this happens, we will make sure to tell you ahead of time if your information will be handed over to another company or if there will be new rules about keeping your information private.
How do we delete your personal information?
We make sure to destroy your personal information securely so it can't be retrieved or used. We do this by following security measures that are standard in our industry. Once laws or regulations no longer allow us to keep your personal information, we start to delete them.
‍
For physical records, we destroy them by shredding. For information stored on electronic media like tapes and hard drives, we completely erase them using secure wipe solutions so they can’t be read. This makes the information unreadable and unusable without authorization.
How do we advertise to you?
To keep you updated with our latest offers and features, we use some of your information for advertising. We may utilize any one or a combination of the following ways to do it:
‍
‍
Collecting your information:
We may gather certain personal details about you, your actions within the app, and your advertising data (depending on your device settings). We analyze these to better understand your general interests and needs.
‍
‍
Profiling:
We may use the information we collect to make a “profile” about you. Our aim is  to gain a broad understanding of what you might prefer and to suggest products or services that align with your preferences. This profile also allows us to remove any biases that may impact your experience in the GCash App. For example, we may use your age to ensure that you receive only ads that are age-appropriate.
‍
Targeted ads:
We may use your profile to show you ads that we think you might be interested in. Rather than showing the same ad to everyone, targeted ads aim to deliver more relevant content to each individual user. Also, a part of targeted ads is determining which ads are suitable to be shown to you. For example, if a product is sold only in certain places, we won't show you ads for products you can't buy.
‍
Ad Preferences:
This empowers you to choose your advertisements. You can take control of your online experience by customizing the advertisements you see in our App. If you ever want to adjust your preferences and interests, just remember, you can easily disable your ad preferences.
‍
‍
Working with partners:
We sometimes work with trusted partners, like advertising companies, to help us show you ads. These partners only get access to coded and anonymous information. They are required to keep your information confidential and comply with laws about protecting your information.
How do we keep your information safe and secure?
Your trust and privacy are important to us. Hence, we aim to be transparent about how and when we share your information, all while ensuring its safety and security.
‍
There can be risks when you create a digital wallet. Someone might attempt to take control of your account (account takeover), pretend to be a family member to trick you into giving away your personal information (social engineering), or even use your cellphone without your permission (hacking). We want to keep your details safe so they won't be used the wrong way, get lost, or be accessed by someone you didn't allow. That's why we've added security measures to help protect against these dangers. These security measures include:
‍
Restricting access:
Only certain people are allowed to see your personal information.
‍
Encryption:
We code your personal information to keep it private when it’s being stored and sent. Encryption is like turning your information into a secret code, which can only be understood by those who have the key.
‍
Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
We use MFA in the GCash App. This means you need more than one factor before you can access your account. For example, if you want to link a new device to your GCash account, you need to use a one-time password (OTP), enter your Mobile PIN, and perform a selfie scan. We also use biometric login.
We regularly check how information moves into and out of our computer systems to make sure it’s protected. We enforce organizational, physical, and technical security measures aligned with recognized industry standards.
‍
If we give your personal information to another company to help us with our services, we make them sign a special agreement. This agreement makes sure they follow the same rules we do to keep your information safe.
‍
Additionally, we advise you to stay vigilant and always protect your passwords. Inform us immediately if you suspect your passwords have been compromised. Never share your MPIN or OTP. For more information on protecting your GCash Account, visit our
Help Center
.
Do we use automatic decision-making processes?
We may make decisions about you using computer systems without human involvement, a process known as automated decision-making. We do this to get a better understanding of you as a customer. By examining your past transactions, repayments, and account balances, we can understand your financial habits, creditworthiness, and behaviors. This process also helps us anticipate your future needs, such as when you might require additional credit. For instance, we might assess your eligibility to avail yourself of our partners’ financial products based on your GScore. To learn more about GScore, please refer to the
GScore FAQs
.
What rights do you have regarding your information?
You have several rights under the law:
You can be told about how we handle your personal information (right to be informed).
You can access the personal information we have about you (right to access).
If we're processing your personal information based on consent or legitimate interest, you can object (right to object).
You can ask us to stop, withdraw, block, delete, or destroy your personal information (right to erasure or blocking).
If your information privacy rights have been violated and you've suffered damage, you can claim compensation (right to damages).
If you feel that your personal information has been misused or your privacy rights have been violated, you can file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (right to file a complaint).
You can dispute and have any mistakes or errors in your personal information corrected (right to rectify).
You can ask us to securely move, copy or transfer your personal information from one company to another (right to information portability).
‍
For more information about your privacy rights, you can visit the National Privacy Commission’s website to look at resources about the
Rights of Data Subjects
.
How can you exercise your data privacy rights?
We'll handle all your requests to access, correct, or move your personal information unless legal reasons prevent us from doing so. You can request a copy of any personal information we have about you, and if something needs updating, we're here to help you correct it. To learn more about managing your personal information, visit the Privacy Choices feature on our GCash app, speak with Gigi, or visit our Help Center.
‍
We value your thoughts, feedback, and requests. If you need to talk to us, call us at 2882 (Customer Care).
Is our Privacy Notice up to date?
