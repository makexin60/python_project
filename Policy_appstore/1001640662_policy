PRIVACY POLICY
Date Last Updated: December 19, 2024
WHO IS MDCALC LTD., INC.?
MDCalc Ltd., Inc.
(
“
MDCalc
,
” “
we
,
”
and
“
us
”
) provides online point-of-care clinical decision-support tools, including medical calculators and clinical practice guidelines (collectively referred to herein as the
“
Service
”
), for use by healthcare professionals. The decision-support tools are based on published clinical research, and MDCalc’s content is written by physician authors.  The Service is not intended for use by laypersons.
SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY
MDCalc takes the private nature of the personal information we collect seriously, and we are committed to protecting it.
Therefore, we have in place controls and procedures designed to manage such information responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws (collectively, “
Privacy Laws
”).
This Privacy Policy applies to MDCalc’s practices where we function as a data controller (or an equivalent role as described under the various Privacy Laws in our regions of operation) and describes our processing practices as it relates to Personal Information collected via: (a) our
www.mdcalc.com
website (“
Website
”), whether from visitors browsing the site or from healthcare professionals who visit the Website and use our medical calculators; (b) our MDCalc Medical Calculator App (the, “
App
”), (c) other direct interactions with individuals/corporate entities, and (d) data that we collect from third parties and provide to our customers through the Service.
The information that MDCalc receives through these interactions does not include Protected Health Information, as that term is defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Protection Act (“
HIPAA
”).
This Privacy Policy describes the categories of Personal Information that we collect and the sources of such information, how we use that Personal Information, to whom Personal Information is disclosed and sold and for what purposes, and the rights you have with respect to your Personal Information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply where MDCalc processes Personal Information as a service provider (or an equivalent role under the various Privacy Laws, such as data processor or service provider).
When we function as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant customer and our agreements with the entity on whose behalf we process the Personal Information will govern our processing of such Personal Information.
THE SERVICE
MDCalc offers both a free version of the Service and an enterprise version.
Healthcare professionals can access the Service for free either via the Website (with or without establishing an account) or via the App, which requires an account.
Although the Website can be accessed without an account, more functionality is offered to those who establish an account.
Healthcare professionals can also access the Service through the electronic health record system utilized by the organization for which they work, if such organization has a contract with MDCalc for integrated access and use of the Service (integrated solutions are referred to as, “
Enterprise Accounts
”).
When the Service is used in the context of an Enterprise Account, MDCalc acts as a service provider and the privacy policy of the enterprise with whom we have a contract will govern MDCalc’s processing of Personal Information through the Service.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
“
Personal Information
” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Personal Information includes information referred to as “personal data,” “personally identifiable information” and such similar references as codified in applicable Privacy Laws.
Under most U.S. Privacy Laws, the information we collect from users of our Service is not considered “
Personal Information
” because it pertains to users in their role as employees or contractors of a commercial entity or nonprofit.
However, certain jurisdictions (e.g., California and the European Union) consider such information to be Personal Information.
Given that, this Privacy Policy treats information about the individuals that use our Service as Personal Information.
Note, however, that your legal rights with respect to Personal Information are determined by the Privacy Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.
OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
MDCalc collects Personal Information in a number of ways: (1) from healthcare professionals who use the Service via the Website or the App (“
Users
”); (2) from visitors to our Website who do not use our Service (“
Website Visitors
”); (3) through other means of ordinary business interactions with individuals, whether via email, snail mail, telephone or in person (collectively, “
Direct Interaction
”), and; (4) from third party health networks and advertising agencies.
The table below sets forth the categories of Personal Information MDCalc has collected in the preceding twelve (12) months, the categories of the sources of such information and the purpose or use for which we collect Personal Information.
Please note that MDCalc only uses the Sensitive Personal Information we collect in order to provide Service to the individual from whom such information is collected and for no other purposes.

Whether Personal Information and/or Sensitive Personal Information is sold or shared.
The length of time MDCalc intends to retain each category of Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information) collected or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.
Note that MDCalc does not knowingly collect, sell or share the Personal Information of individuals under the age of 17.
Right to Know What Personal Information Is Collected and Right to Access:
As a California resident, you have the right to request from MDCalc disclosure of the following information, up to twice in a twelve-month period:

IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OR SWITZERLAND (collectively, “Europe”)
MDCalc complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the UK Data Protection Act of 2018 and the Swiss Data Protection Act of 2020 (collectively, “
GDPR
”) with respect to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Information and the free movement of such Personal Information.
Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:
Right of Access
:
You have the right to ask us for copies of your Personal Information. The law provides for some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the Personal Information we process.

Right to Restrict Processing
:

Right to Withdraw Consent
:
You have the right to revoke your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time by contacting us via the
Data Rights Request Form

Right to Erasure
:
You have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Information in certain circumstances.
Right to Data Portability
:
This only applies to Personal Information you have given to us and that is held electronically. You have the right to ask that we transfer this information from MDCalc to another organization or give it to you.
If you wish to exercise your rights above, you may contact us by completing this form:
Data Rights Request Form
. You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. We have one month to respond to you. You may also contact the relevant supervisory authority to lodge a complaint related to our handling of your Personal Information. However, we invite you to give us a chance to resolve the situation directly with you. Your privacy is important to us, and we will do our best to address any concerns.
Though we make our Service available globally, our computer systems are based in the United States, which means Personal Information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as in Europe. For transfers to the United States, we will either rely on a derogation applicable to the specific situation (e.g. consent or if the transfer is necessary to perform our contract with you) or implement the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission and/or an International Data Transfer Addendum with respect to transfers outside of the United Kingdom.
The legal bases for processing your Personal Information include one or more of the following depending on the circumstances:
To comply with contractual obligations or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract.
When you subscribe to the Service or purchase Continuing Medical Education packages, we will process your Personal Information in order to provide the Service to you and answer your requests.
As a result of your consent.
In certain cases, you consent to the processing of your Personal Information by us (e.g., when you submit the Contact Form via the Website or use our Service.) When consent is the basis on which we process your Personal Information, we will inform you if we need to carry out further processing for purposes other than those for which you provided us with your consent and obtain your further consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time. For further information on the right of withdrawal, please contact MDCalc via the
Data Rights Request Form
.
Within the scope of a legitimate interest.
On occasion, where we have a legitimate interest to process your Personal Information, we may not need your consent to do so, however, we must inform you that we do this. Examples of a legitimate interest include:
The analysis and optimization of the Website and App;
Ensuring IT security and the operation of MDCalc’s technology;
Prevention and investigation of criminal acts.
On the basis of MDCalc’s legal obligations or in the public interest
. In some cases the processing of your Personal Information will be necessary for us to fulfill legal or public interest obligations.
If MDCalc uses email prospecting, we first obtain the consent of the individual, unless the recipient is already a customer and the email involves products similar to those we already provide to such customer. In such instances, the legal basis of the processing is the legitimate interest of MDCalc, namely to promote our products to our customers. When MDCalc sends commercial solicitations to customers by email regarding products other than those already provided to such customers, the legal basis of the processing is consent.
You have the right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your data to third parties. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please reach out to us via the
Data Rights Request Form
.
HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION?
MDCalc retains Personal Information collected from Users until such time as the individual deletes their profile via the functionality provided. The information is retained to better understand the usage patterns of our audience.

How Google retains data we collect
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.

How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services
Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.
For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also
set cookies on your browser
or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver our services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our
Advertising
page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
Our
Privacy Policy
explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, we may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
Sometimes, when processing information shared with us by sites and apps, those sites and apps will ask for your consent before allowing Google to process your information. For example, a banner may appear on a site asking for consent for Google to process the information that site collects. When that happens, we will respect the purposes described in the consent you give to the site or app, rather than the legal grounds described in the Google Privacy Policy. If you want to change or withdraw your consent, you should visit the site or app in question to do so.
Ad personalization
If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your
ad settings
.
How you can control the information collected by Google on these sites and apps
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services:
Ad Settings
helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also
learn how
ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings,
My Activity
allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can
install the Google Analytics browser add-on
. Learn more about
Google Analytics and privacy

Incognito mode in Chrome
allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about
cookies
. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the

Learn More
.
Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services.

Financial services
. Certain Business Users leverage our Services to offer financial services to you via Stripe or our Financial Partners. For example, a Business User may issue a card product with which you can purchase goods and services. Such cards could carry the brand of Stripe, the bank partner, and/or the Business User.

Who we are
Who is providing this notice?
Stripe, Inc., Stripe Payments Company, and their affiliates that provide consumers services in the U.S.
What we do
How does Stripe protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse we use security measures to comply with federal law.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We impose access controls along with ongoing monitoring to prevent data misuse, and we require our service providers to take similar steps to protect your information.
How does Stripe collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
• open a Link account;
• ask Stripe to process a payment for goods or services;
• provide bank account information to Stripe using Financial Connections
We also collect your personal information from others, such as affiliates or other companies.
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
• sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
• affiliates from using your information to market to you
• sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you.
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See the Other Important Information section below for more information on your rights under state law.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
