How do we protect your personal data?
We are committed to protecting our customer’s privacy and we know how much data security means to all our customers. With this in mind, we treat your data carefully and take all appropriate steps to ensure it is protected.
We secure access to all transactional areas, including registration and checkout process, of our websites using ‘https’ technology.
Access to your personal data is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as payment card information) is secured by SSL encryption.
We regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out testing to identify ways to further strengthen security.
How long do we keep your personal data?
We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Service team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.
Who do we share your personal data with?
We sometimes share your personal data with trusted third parties.
For example, delivery couriers so they can let you know when your order will be delivered, to help us personalise our offers to you and so on.
Here’s the policy we apply to those organisations to keep your data safe and protect your privacy:
•
We ensure that we provide only the information they need to perform their specific services.
•
They may only use your data for the exact purposes we specify in our contract with them.
•
We work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected at all times.
•
If we stop using their services, any of your data held by them will either be deleted or rendered anonymous.
Examples of the kind of third parties we work with are:
•
Operational companies such as delivery couriers.
•
Direct marketing companies who help us manage our communications with you.
•
Google/Facebook to show you products that might interest you while you’re browsing the internet. This is based on either your marketing consent or your acceptance of cookies on our websites. See our Cookies Notice for details.
•
IT companies who support our website and other business systems.
•
Data insight companies to ensure your details are up to date and accurate.
•
Sharing your data with third party companies to gather insight into our products and services.
We will only do this in very specific circumstances, for example:
•
For fraud management, we may share information about fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activity
in
our premises or systems. This may include sharing data about individuals with law enforcement bodies.
•
We may also be required to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body, in your country of origin or elsewhere, upon a valid request to do so. These requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis and take the privacy of our customers into consideration.
For further information please contact our Data Protection Officer.
To help personalise your journey through Cooksongold we currently use the following companies, who will process your personal data as part of their contracts with us:

Where your data may be processed?
Sometimes we will need to share your personal data with third parties and suppliers outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
International orders
If you are based outside the UK and place an order with us, we will hold the personal data that we collect from you in the UK.
Protecting your data outside the EEA
The EEA includes all EU Member countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third-party data processors in countries that are outside the EEA.
If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the EEA. For example, we ensure that our contracts with third parties stipulate the standards they must follow at all times. If you wish for more information about these contracts please contact our Data Protection Officer.
Any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws and we will treat the information under the guiding principles of this Privacy Notice.
Your rights on your personal data
You have the right to request:
•
Access to the personal data we hold about you.
•
The correction of your personal data when incorrect, out of date or incomplete.
•
For example, when you withdraw
consent,
or object and we have no legitimate overriding interest, or once the purpose for which we hold the data has come to an end (such as the end of a warranty).
•
That we stop using your personal data for direct marketing (either through specific channels, or all channels).
•
That we stop any consent-based processing of your personal data after you withdraw that consent.
You have the right to request a copy of any information about you that Cooksongold holds at any time, and also to have that information corrected if it is inaccurate. To ask for your information, please contact Data Protection Officer, Cooksongold, 59-83 Vittoria Street, Birmingham, B1 3NZ, or email
dpo@cooksongold.com.
To ask for your information to be amended, please update your online account, or contact our Customer Services team.
If we choose not to action your request we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.
Your right to withdraw consent
Whenever you have given us your consent to use your personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent.
Where we rely on our legitimate interest
In cases where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, you can ask us to stop for reasons connected to your individual situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have a legitimate overriding reason to continue processing your personal data.
Direct Marketing
You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for direct marketing activity through all channels. We must always comply with your request.
Checking your identity
To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will ask you to verify your identity before proceeding with any request you make under this Privacy Notice.
How can you stop the use of personal data for marketing?
If you have given us consent, we’ll send you marketing messages by email, text and post to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products.
You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time.
You can do this:
•
Through the contact preferences area of your account settings
•
By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email
•
By contacting our Customer Service team
Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.
Please note that, as Cooksongold comprises of many inter-connecting services, it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we process your request.
Stopping marketing messages will not stop service communications (such as order updates).
If you live outside the UK
For all non-UK customers
By using our services or providing your personal data to us, you are expressly consenting to the processing of your personal data by us or on our behalf. Of course, you still have the right to ask us not to process your data in certain ways, and if you do so, we will respect your wishes.
Sometimes we’ll need to transfer your personal data between countries to enable us to supply the goods or services you’ve requested. In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer your personal data from your country of residence to ourselves and to third parties located in the UK.
By dealing with us, you are giving your consent to this overseas use, transfer and disclosure of your personal data outside your country of residence for our ordinary business purposes.
This may occur because our information technology storage facilities and servers are located outside your country of residence, and could include storage of your personal data on servers in the UK.
We’ll ensure that reasonable steps are taken to prevent third parties outside your country of residence using your personal data in any way that’s not set out in this Privacy Notice. We’ll also make sure we adequately protect the confidentiality and privacy of your personal data.
