Tracking Technologies
Some of our automatic data collection is facilitated by cookies and other technologies:
Cookies,
which are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place, and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.
Local storage technologies,
like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
Web beacons,
also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.
Chat technologies,
such as those provided by a third party service provider, that employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features that you can use to communicate with us through the Website.  Chat technology providers and other third parties may access and use information about webpages visited on our website, your IP address, your general geographic information (e.g., city, state), and other personal information you share through online chats for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
For more information, see the Cookie Preferences banner or button on our website.
Disclosure of Information
We may share your personal information with third parties in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy, in other applicable notices, or at the time of collection.

Affiliates.
We may disclose your personal information to our corporate parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates.
Payment processor.
Any payment card information you use to make a purchase on the Website is collected and processed directly by our payment processors, such as Stripe. Stripe may use your payment data in accordance with its privacy policy,
https://stripe.com/privacy.
Professional advisors.
We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
Authorities and others.
In certain situations, Egnyte may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
requirements, or
by
private
parties. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation, or other government authority and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to prevent or respond to fraud or abuse, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Egnyte. When we process personal information about you for the aforementioned reasons, failure to provide such data may prevent or delay our fulfillment of these obligations.
Business transferees.
We may disclose your personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Egnyte's assets or stock in Egnyte's line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. (If, for example, in the future, we undergo any sort of corporate reorganization, we may need to transfer your personal information to the surviving entity.)
Marketing partners.
If your personal information was acquired through our marketing activities, we might share your personal information with third parties assisting us in confirming data accuracy and engaging in communications with you or other marketing partners.
Advertising partners.
We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. We may share your personal information with these third parties for the purposes described herein.
Other visitors and the public.
We may share your Blog and Testimonial Data with other visitors of the Website and the public. This information can be seen, collected and used by others, including being cached, copied, screen captured or stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines), and we are not responsible for any such use of this information.
Updating Your Information
If you would like to exercise your data privacy rights to correct, update, or delete your personal information, you may contact us directly at
privacy@egnyte.com
.
Retention of Information
We generally retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.
When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, anonymize it, or isolate it from further processing.
Protection of Information
We employ procedural and technological measures designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
A Special Note About Children
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
If you believe that a child under the age of 13 may have provided us their personal information, please contact us at
privacy@egnyte.com
.
Links to Third Party Websites
We may place from time-to-time links on our website to one or more websites of our business partners. Some business partners may collect personal information when you access their links or when you indicate you would like to participate in a special offer. When you click on a link to a third-party website from our website, your activity and use on the linked website is governed by that website's policies, not by those of Egnyte. We encourage you to visit their websites and review their privacy and user policies, as this Privacy Policy does not apply to such third-party websites.

These features may collect your personal information, such as your IP address or which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
International Data Transfer
Please understand that Egnyte hosts its website in the United States, so if you are providing Egnyte with any personal information, you are consenting to that data being collected and processed in the United States in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Supplemental Information for California Residents
The following provisions describe how Egnyte collects, uses, and shares personal information of California residents in our capacity as a “business” under the CCPA and CPRA.

Under certain circumstances, California residents have the following rights in relation to their personal information:
Right of access.
You may have the right to request that we disclose to you information about our collection and use of your personal information in the preceding 12 months, including: (a) the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect; (b) the categories of sources from which we collect personal information; (c) the business or commercial purpose for which we collect, sell or share personal information; (d) the categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information; (e) the categories of personal information that we sold, disclosed, or shared for a business purpose; and (f) the categories of third parties to whom such personal information was sold, shared or disclosed.  You can also request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.

Right to opt-out.
You may have the right to request that your personal information not be “sold” to third parties or “shared” for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not sell personal information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as “selling” or “sharing” your personal information with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can submit requests to opt-out of this “selling” or “sharing” by contacting us at
privacy@egnyte.com

You may make a request at any time to exercise your privacy rights to access, deletion, and correction by contacting us at
privacy@egnyte.com
or by phone at
877-734-6983
.
Verification of identity; Authorized agents.
We may need to verify your identity in order to process your information access, correction, or deletion
requests and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require government identification, a declaration under penalty of perjury, or other information, where permitted by law.
Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465.  If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CPRA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity, and provide us with confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
Personal information that we collect, use and disclose. We have summarized the personal information we collect and may disclose to third parties by reference below to both the categories defined above in the “
What Information is Collected

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center

You may save a number of different kinds of Personal Data using Link. For instance, you may save your name, payment method details, contact information, and address to conveniently use saved information to pay for transactions across our Business Users. When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data associated with your transactions.

You can ask us to cease the collection of such data at any time.

Finally, you can use Link to store your identity documents (such as your driver’s license) so that you can share them in future interactions with Stripe or its Business Users.

1.2 End Customers
Stripe provides various Business Services to our Business Users, which include processing in-person or online payments or payouts for those Business Users.

This happens, for example, when we process a payment for a Business User because you purchased a product from them, or when the Business User asks us to send you funds.
Business Users are responsible for ensuring that the privacy rights of their End Customers are respected, including obtaining appropriate consents and making disclosures about their own data collection and use associated with their products and services.
