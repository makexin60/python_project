4. How We May Share Information about You with Others
Your personal data may be transmitted to trusted and reliable third parties. This happens only when there are lawful grounds for the transmission. We don’t sell your data, including your images, to third parties under any circumstances.
The types of third parties to which your data may be transmitted are as follows:
Third parties that carry out activities related to our business and operations. Such parties can operate either on our behalf as data processors (for example, IT or storage service providers) or as autonomous data controllers (for example, professional advisors providing advice or otherwise protecting and managing our business interests).
Third parties that collect personal data about you to show personalized advertising.
We may share certain information with Facebook that allows us to create Custom or Lookalike Audiences.  You may learn more about Facebook Lookalike Audiences
here
and about your off-Facebook activity and how to opt out of having such activity sent to Facebook
here
. We encourage you to review Facebook's
Privacy Policy
.
We may also use Google Ads and Google Analytics to advertise our products, and for remarketing and optimization purposes and to understand how you interact with us across different devices. For example, where individuals allow for personalized ads in their Google settings, we use Google Signals on our websites and apps to target those interested in our products with advertisements and understand different groups of users based on the different device combinations. You may opt-out of the use of this tracking technology by turning off personalized ads in your Google settings or by visiting
Google’s Advertising and Privacy page

Additionally, we may share your personal data if it’s required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, or if you give us your consent to do so.
5. Do Not Track Disclosures
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our sites do not currently process or respond to "do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
Certain third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect information about your online activities over time and across websites. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. Information about how to opt out from your data being used by third parties can be found above under " Information collected by automated means."
6. Social Media
We may incorporate some third-party social networking features into our Services (including, allowing users to interact with others and share certain content and information on social media platforms) or utilize third-party provided platforms to publish or manage the Services or portions thereof. Through these platforms and features, we receive or may share information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well. In addition, some providers of third-party social media or blogging platforms we utilize have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them may collect, use and protect your information (e.g., if you establish an account with such platform providers directly). By using social features, you acknowledge those third parties’ privacy policies and agree to their terms of use.
If you choose to communicate with us or another user through social features available on our websites or mobile applications or through our social media pages, or other similar communication or messaging features or services, such information may be made publicly available. For security purposes, please do not include any password, social security number, payment card or other sensitive information via these features. We have the right, but not the obligation to monitor messages and communications between and among users for security and training purposes. We may, but are not obligated to, remove any content we deem inappropriate.
7. Data Retention
We retain personal data used for defense purposes for a maximum of ten (10) years from your most recent interaction with the app, or from the expiration of your subscription. If you access the app after your subscription has expired, the retention period starts from this most recent interaction. Specific legal obligations might require different retention periods and, in such cases, those different periods will apply. Upon the expiry of the retention period, the data is either deleted or anonymized.
We retain personal data used for the purpose of compliance with legal obligations for a maximum of five (5) years from your most recent interaction with the app, or from the expiration of your subscription. If you access the app after your subscription has expired, the retention period starts from this most recent interaction. Specific legal obligations might require different retention periods and, in such cases, those different periods will apply. Upon the expiry of the retention period, the data is either deleted or anonymized.
We retain the personal data for a maximum of three (3) years from your most recent interaction with the app, or from the expiration of your subscription. If you access the app after your subscription has expired, the retention period starts from this most recent interaction. After this period, unless any legal obligations require that the data is retained for longer, the data is either deleted or anonymized.
We encourage you to contact us at
privacy@bendingspoons.com

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data
: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information or to limit our use of it;
Deletion

We will honor such requests unless we have to retain this information to comply with a legal obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it;
Portability
: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider); and
Consent Management
: where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time. You do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is based on consent.
For your protection, we may require proof of identity and verification before we can answer your requests.
You also have the right to complain before the competent national data protection authority, or any other applicable regulator in the jurisdiction where you reside, in the event that you think we’ve violated the applicable privacy laws and we haven’t addressed your request.
Legal basis for processing data
In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process personal information.
In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the personal information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and support our products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our business; to facilitate and manage engagement programs; to promote research; to support our recruitment activities; to facilitate a Corporate Transaction (including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition); or to fulfill our contracts with business partners, such as third parties that distribute our products.
It may also be necessary for us to process personal information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity, and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the services we provide.
We may also process personal information as specifically permitted by applicable legal requirements.
If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, we will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal information.
International data transfers
We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you are located outside of the United States, we may transfer your personal information to the United States. The countries to which we transfer personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer personal information across borders, we consider a variety of requirements that may apply to such transfers.
Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area to:
Countries that the European Commissions has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information,
Pursuant to the recipient's compliance with standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), or Binding Corporate Rules,
Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information pertains, or
As otherwise permitted by applicable EEA requirements.
9. Information for Residents of California: Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("
CCPA
") may provide you with rights that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our use of your personal information. The CCPA Notice applies to "Consumers" as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. See Sections 1 - 4 above to learn what information we collected from you and how it is collected, used and shared.
Access Rights
No more than twice in a twelve-month period, you may request the right to know what personal information we have collected about you, including the categories of personal information, specific pieces of personal information, categories of sources from which we collected your personal information, business or commercial purposes for our collection or sale of your personal information, and categories of third parties to whom we’ve disclosed your personal information.
Data Correction Rights
You may request to have inaccurate personal information corrected and updated.
Data Deletion Rights
Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.
Exercising Your Rights
To make a request for access, correction, or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, send an e-mail to
privacy@bendingspoons.com
. Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process ("
Verifiable Consumer Request
").
The Verifiable Consumer Request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). In accordance with the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
Opt-Out
To make a request to opt-out of sale under CCPA, send an e-mail to
privacy@bendingspoons.com
. See
1
: Online Privacy Choices and Rights to learn how you can exercise your rights regarding interest-based advertising.
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if we share Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes you will be able to elect for us not to do so by submitting your request to
privacy@bendingspoons.com
(please include your name, mailing address, and email address).
10. Information for Residents of Mainland China
If you are a resident of Mainland China (“Mainland China”, for the purpose of this Privacy Policy, excluding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan), the PRC laws and regulations contain rules that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our collection, use, transfer and retention of your personal information.
Principles of Collection
We only collect your information to the extent necessary to provide one or more of the Services, and will do so only by fair and reasonable means. The legal basis for collecting and using the information depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it. During your use of some features, we will collect your personal information after obtaining your consent. Unless the provision of such information is required by applicable laws and regulations, refusing to provide such information will only result in your inability to use the related features, and will not affect your use of other features.
Sensitive Personal Information
Access to sensitive personal information, such as contacts, exact location, camera, microphone and album, is disabled by default, and will only be enabled upon your express authorization. It is important to note that obtaining your authorization to access sensitive personal information is a necessary but not sufficient condition for us to collect certain information. Our acquisition of your authorization to access sensitive personal information does not mean that we will definitely collect your relevant information. We will only collect your sensitive personal information when there is a specified purpose and sufficient necessity and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For the collection and processing of sensitive personal information, specific consent shall be obtained from you.
We place great value on the protection of minors’ personal information. As required by applicable laws and regulations, any user under the age of 14 shall obtain the written consent of his/her parent or statutory guardian prior to providing sensitive personal information to us.
Information Shared with a Third Party
We will share your personal information with third parties only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unless explicitly authorized by you, we will not share any information that can be used to identify your identity (such as your name or email address). We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties. We will direct all such third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and not to use your information for any purpose other than that have been authorized by you.
Data Retention
We may retain your personal information for the longer of three (3) years after we become aware that you have ceased using our services or for so long as necessary to fulfill any contractual obligation governing the information or our legal and regulatory obligations. However, we may not know if you have stopped using our services, so we encourage you to contact us at the appropriate support email in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy if you are no longer using the services. We may retain other information that is not personally identifiable for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
Upon the expiry of the retention period, unless any legal obligations require that personal information is retained for longer, the data is either deleted or anonymized.
If we discontinue providing our Services, we will notify you of such change by sending a notification, posting an announcement, or other means, and delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable period. “Anonymization” refers to the irreversible erasure or removal of sensitive personal information that leads to the information owner being identified. Any anonymized information shall not be considered as personal information.
Your personal information collected from Mainland China will be stored in a location within Mainland China in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If it is necessary to change the location where your personal information is stored from Mainland China to another location outside Mainland China, the information transfer will be conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws.
Right to Delete Information
We will delete, and you have the right to request the deletion of, your personal information if the purpose of processing such personal information has been achieved or is unable to be achieved, or the personal information is no longer necessary for achieving such purpose, we cease the provision of the Service, or the required information retention period has expired, relevant authorization or consent is withdrawn by you, the processing of personal information by us is in violation of any applicable law, regulations or agreement, or any other circumstances as provided by applicable laws or regulations.
If the information retention period prescribed by law has not expired, or it is technically difficult to delete the personal information, we will cease the processing of such personal information, except for storage and any necessary measure taken to protect your personal information.
11. Online Privacy Choices and Rights
Device permissions
Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as camera and microphone as well as push notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
Uninstall
You can stop all information collection by the app by disabling call forwarding and deactivating your account by following the instructions on the Service's Settings screen and then uninstalling the app using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.
Location information
If you choose to opt-in, some of our apps may collect your device's precise real-time location, and in such cases, you may be able to opt out from further allowing us to have access to such location data by managing your location preferences in the app and/or on your device.
Notice to Nevada users
We do not sell covered information, as defined under Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and we do not have plans to sell this information. However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, please contact us at
privacy@bendingspoons.com
. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this information and contact you if our practices change.
New Privacy Laws
We understand that privacy laws are constantly evolving. New US state laws and new international privacy laws are consistently emerging, developing and being enacted. We will respect all applicable privacy laws.
Advertising Opt-Outs
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
, and
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
for information on the DAA's opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
When you allow Notifications, we may send you offers and promotions related to our products and features. You may opt-out of these through the Settings menu on your device.
12. How We Protect Personal Information
We use various efforts intended to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information collected through our Services. Despite these measures, however, we cannot and do not guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from interception or intrusion during transmission or while stored on our system, or otherwise, and you provide information to us at your own risk.
If you correspond with us by email or using Web forms like a "contact us" feature available through our Services, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure from access by unauthorized parties. We have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. If you create an
account
as part of using our Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.
If we believe that the security of your personal information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If we have your email address, we may notify you by email to the most recent email address you have provided us in your account profile. Please keep your email address in your account up to date. You can change that email address anytime in your account profile. If you receive a notice from us, you can print it to retain a copy of it. To receive these notices, you must check your email account using your computer or mobile device and email application software. We may also post a conspicuous notice on our site or notify you through the mobile application.
13. Links to Websites and Third-Party Content
For your convenience and information, we may provide links to websites and other third-party content that is not owned or operated by us. The websites and third-party content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any entity that we do not own or control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of such third parties before providing them with any personal information.
14. Information Relating to Children
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EEA, or older if required in an applicable jurisdiction to comply with applicable laws). If you are not over 13 years of age (or 16 in the EEA, or older if required in an applicable jurisdiction to comply with applicable laws) then
DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SERVICES
. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that we may have personal information from or about your child under 13, please contact us at
privacy@bendingspoons.com
. Note that we'll attempt to delete the account of any child under the age of 13 that's reported to us as soon as possible. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account.
15. In-app tracking technologies
When we refer to “tracking technology” or “tracking technologies” in this policy, we mean any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device, including SDKs, tracking pixels, HTML5 local storage, local shared objects, and fingerprinting techniques.
Tracking technologies are usually classified by purpose (technical, analytics, profiling) and by publisher (first-party, third-party). The legal requirements vary based on these classifications.
The tracking technology classifications and some practical examples now follow.
By purpose
Technical tracking technologies
These are used to transmit messages over an electronic communication network or to provide a service specifically requested by the user. Therefore, they’re necessary for the app to function correctly, and for providing the service requested by and offered to the user.
For example, technical tracking technologies can be used to monitor sessions, store specific server access information related to the user configuration, facilitate the use of online content, keep track of items in a shopping cart, or keep track of information used to fill in a form.
As technical tracking technologies are necessary, they don’t need your consent.
Analytics tracking technologies
These are used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, evaluate and improve the design of an app, or help measure traffic. In other words, they serve to track the traffic and performance of an app by collecting aggregate data on the number of users and how they interact with the app, which helps to improve its services.
For example, analytics tracking technologies may collect information about how users access an app, including the number of users and potentially grouped by geographical area, time zone, how long they stay on the app, which parts of the app they interact with, and the number of users who used a particular feature.
Normally, analytics tracking technologies are used only with your explicit consent. However, in the following cases they’re treated like technical trackers, so don’t need your consent:
When they’re used only to produce aggregated statistics that are performed through the controller’s own resources and that don’t turn into activities that go beyond statistical counting and assisting business-related decision-making
When the third parties don’t match the analytics trackers' data with any other information, and don’t send any data gathered to other third parties
Profiling tracking technologies
These are used to evaluate some personal aspects of certain users, and to trace specific actions or recurring behavioral patterns in the use of the app in relation to specific, identified or identifiable individuals, so they can be grouped within homogeneous, multi-sized clusters. This enables the company to analyze and predict personal elements, provide users with customized services beyond what’s strictly necessary for the delivery of the service, and sending targeted advertising messages in line with the preferences they express during their in-app activities. These serve to convey behavioral advertising, measure the effectiveness of ads, and customize the services offered in line with the user’s monitored behavior.
For example, profiling tracking technologies can be used for the following activities:
To create user profiles and offer content in line with the user’s interests
To send targeted ads or messages
To conduct statistical analysis or other research activities to improve our products and services and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns
Profiling tracking technologies are used only with your explicit consent.
By publisher
First-party tracking technologies
These are installed and managed directly by the owner of the app (in this case, Bending Spoons S.p.A). As the owner, we process the collected data for our own purposes.
Third-party tracking technologies
These are installed and managed by different apps or developers, either for our purposes or for those of the third party.
The data collected by the third parties for their own purposes is governed by their specific privacy policies and terms and conditions. For further information about these data processing activities, you can directly refer to the privacy policy of the relevant third parties as indicated in the subsection
Types of tracking technologies used by the app

How Google retains data we collect
Advertising
Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.
Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the
Privacy Sandbox
initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on
Topics
or
Protected Audience
data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using
Attribution Reporting
data stored on their browser or mobile device.
More information on the Privacy Sandbox

How Google uses cookies in advertising
Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).
We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These
server logs
typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
Our advertising cookies
To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.
See more detail about the
types of cookies used by Google
and our partners and
how we use them
.
How you can control advertising cookies
You can use
ad settings
to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.
You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
aboutads.info choices
page or the EU-based
Your Online Choices
.
Finally, you can
manage cookies in your web browser
.
Other technologies used in advertising
Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the
IP address
, for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
Location
Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us.  Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:
Reset your device’s advertising ID
, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
Delete your device’s advertising ID
, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.
To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

Settings
app on your device.
Connected TV/Over-the-Top
Advertising identifiers for connected TV
Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.
The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:
Reset advertising ID
Delete advertising ID
Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
Your advertising ID (long string)
These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

What determines the ads by Google that I see?
Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.
Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.
Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.
Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.
The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.
You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.
Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.
We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

Protezione dati
Supporto Firebase per GDPR e CCPA
Il 25 maggio 2018, il Regolamento generale sulla protezione dei dati (GDPR) dell’UE ha sostituito la Direttiva europea sulla protezione dei dati del 1995. Il 1° gennaio 2020 è entrato in vigore il California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Il 1° gennaio 2023 è entrato in vigore il California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), una legge sulla privacy dei dati che modifica e amplia il CCPA. Google si impegna ad aiutare i nostri clienti ad avere successo nel rispetto di queste normative sulla privacy, siano essi grandi società di software o sviluppatori indipendenti.
Il GDPR impone obblighi ai titolari e ai responsabili del trattamento dei dati, mentre il CCPA/CPRA impone obblighi alle imprese e ai loro fornitori di servizi. I clienti Firebase in genere agiscono come "titolare del trattamento dei dati" (GDPR) o "aziendale" (CCPA/CPRA) per qualsiasi dato personale o informazione sui propri utenti finali che forniscono a Google in relazione al loro utilizzo di Firebase e Google generalmente opera come un “responsabile del trattamento” (GDPR) o un “fornitore di servizi” (CCPA/CPRA).
Ciò significa che i dati sono sotto il controllo del cliente. I clienti sono responsabili di obblighi come l'adempimento dei diritti di un individuo rispetto ai propri dati o informazioni personali.
Termini per l'elaborazione e la sicurezza dei dati Firebase
Quando i clienti utilizzano Firebase, Google è generalmente un responsabile del trattamento dei dati ai sensi del GDPR ed elabora i dati personali per loro conto. Allo stesso modo, quando i clienti utilizzano Firebase, Google generalmente opera come fornitore di servizi ai sensi del CCPA/CPRA gestendo le informazioni personali per loro conto. I termini di Firebase includono
termini per l'elaborazione dei dati e la sicurezza
che descrivono in dettaglio queste responsabilità.
Alcuni servizi Firebase regolati dai
Termini di servizio di Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
sono già coperti dai termini di elaborazione dei dati associati, l'
Addendum sull'elaborazione dei dati nel cloud
. Un elenco completo dei servizi Firebase attualmente regolati dai Termini di servizio GCP è disponibile nei
Termini di servizio per i servizi Firebase
.
Google Analytics è un servizio separato che può essere utilizzato insieme a Firebase ed è soggetto a
termini
separati .
Firebase è certificato secondo i principali standard di privacy e sicurezza

Trasferimenti internazionali di dati
Gli schemi dello Scudo per la privacy fornivano un meccanismo per conformarsi ai requisiti di protezione dei dati durante il trasferimento di dati personali del SEE, del Regno Unito o della Svizzera negli Stati Uniti e oltre. Alla luce della sentenza della Corte di giustizia dell'Unione europea sui trasferimenti di dati, che invalida lo scudo per la privacy UE-USA, Firebase è passata a fare affidamento sulle clausole contrattuali standard per i trasferimenti di dati rilevanti, che, secondo la sentenza, possono continuare a essere una decisione meccanismo legale valido per trasferire i dati ai sensi del GDPR. Il 4 giugno 2021 la Commissione Europea ha approvato le nuove versioni delle clausole contrattuali standard, che stiamo incorporando nei nostri contratti con i clienti Firebase per i trasferimenti di dati rilevanti.
Ci impegniamo ad avere una base legale per i trasferimenti di dati in conformità con le leggi applicabili sulla protezione dei dati.
Informativa sul trattamento dei dati
Esempi di dati degli utenti finali elaborati da Firebase
Alcuni servizi Firebase elaborano i dati degli utenti finali per fornire il proprio servizio. La tabella seguente contiene esempi di come i vari servizi Firebase utilizzano e gestiscono i dati degli utenti finali che potrebbero potenzialmente identificarli. Inoltre, molti servizi Firebase offrono la possibilità di richiedere la cancellazione di dati specifici o di controllare la modalità di gestione dei dati.
Servizio Firebase
Dati dell'utente finale
In che modo i dati aiutano a fornire il servizio
Funzioni cloud per Firebase
Indirizzi IP
A cosa serve:
Cloud Functions utilizza gli indirizzi IP per eseguire funzioni di gestione degli eventi e funzioni HTTP in base alle azioni dell'utente finale.
Conservazione:
le funzioni cloud salvano gli indirizzi IP solo temporaneamente, per fornire il servizio.
Autenticazione Firebase
Le password
Indirizzi email
Numeri di telefono
Agenti utente
Indirizzi IP
A cosa serve:
Firebase Authentication utilizza i dati per abilitare l'autenticazione dell'utente finale e facilitare la gestione dell'account dell'utente finale. Utilizza inoltre stringhe user-agent e indirizzi IP per fornire maggiore sicurezza e prevenire abusi durante la registrazione e l'autenticazione.
Conservazione:
l'autenticazione Firebase conserva gli indirizzi IP registrati per alcune settimane. Conserva altre informazioni di autenticazione finché il cliente Firebase non avvia l'eliminazione dell'utente associato, dopodiché i dati vengono rimossi dai sistemi live e di backup entro 180 giorni.
Controllo dell'app Firebase
Materiale di attestazione proveniente da fornitori di attestazioni supportati
Token App Check provenienti da attestazioni riuscite
A cosa serve:
Firebase App Check utilizza il materiale di attestazione richiesto dal fornitore di attestazioni corrispondente e ricevuto dai dispositivi dell'utente finale per aiutare a stabilire l'integrità del dispositivo e/o dell'app. I materiali di attestazione vengono inviati al fornitore di attestazioni corrispondente per la convalida in base alla configurazione dello sviluppatore. I token App Check ottenuti da attestazioni riuscite vengono inviati con ogni richiesta ai servizi Firebase supportati per accedere alle risorse protette da App Check.
Conservazione:
il materiale di attestazione non viene conservato da App Check, ma quando viene inviato ai fornitori di attestazioni, è soggetto ai termini di tali fornitori di attestazioni. I token App Check restituiti dalle attestazioni riuscite sono validi per tutta la loro durata TTL, che non può essere superiore a 7 giorni. Per gli sviluppatori che utilizzano funzionalità di protezione dalla riproduzione, App Check archivia i token App Check utilizzati con queste funzionalità per un massimo di 30 giorni. Altri token App Check non utilizzati con le funzionalità di protezione della riproduzione non vengono conservati dai servizi Firebase.
Distribuzione dell'app Firebase
Nomi degli utenti
Indirizzi email
UDID iOS
Proteggi gli ID Android
ID di installazione di Firebase
Feedback del tester (screenshot e testo)
A cosa serve:
Firebase App Distribution utilizza i dati per distribuire build di app ai tester, monitorare l'attività dei tester, abilitare funzionalità dei tester come feedback in-app e associare i dati ai dispositivi dei tester.
Conservazione:
Firebase App Distribution conserva le informazioni dell'utente fino a quando il cliente Firebase non ne richiede l'eliminazione, dopodiché i dati vengono rimossi dai sistemi live e di backup entro 180 giorni.
Messaggistica cloud Firebase
ID di installazione di Firebase
A cosa serve:
Firebase Cloud Messaging utilizza gli ID di installazione Firebase per determinare a quali dispositivi recapitare i messaggi.
Conservazione:
Firebase conserva gli ID di installazione Firebase finché il cliente Firebase non effettua una chiamata API per eliminare l'ID. Dopo la chiamata, i dati vengono rimossi dai sistemi live e di backup entro 180 giorni.
Crashlytics di Firebase
UUID di installazione di Crashlytics
ID delle installazioni Firebase
Tracce di incidenti
Dati formattati minidump di Breakpad
(Solo NDK si arresta in modo anomalo)
A cosa serve:
Firebase Crashlytics utilizza le analisi dello stack di arresti anomali per associare gli arresti anomali a un progetto, inviare avvisi e-mail ai membri del progetto e visualizzarli nella console Firebase e aiutare i clienti Firebase a eseguire il debug degli arresti anomali. Utilizza gli UUID di installazione di Crashlytics per misurare il numero di utenti interessati da un arresto anomalo e dati minidump per elaborare gli arresti anomali di NDK. I dati del minidump vengono archiviati durante l'elaborazione della sessione di arresto anomalo e quindi eliminati. L'ID di installazione di Firebase abilita le funzionalità future che miglioreranno i servizi di segnalazione degli arresti anomali e di gestione degli arresti anomali. Fare riferimento a
Esempi di informazioni sul dispositivo memorizzate
per maggiori dettagli sui tipi di informazioni utente raccolte.
Conservazione:
Firebase Crashlytics conserva le tracce dello stack di arresto anomalo, i dati minidump estratti e gli identificatori associati (inclusi gli UUID di installazione di Crashlytics e gli ID di installazione di Firebase) per 90 giorni prima di iniziare il processo di rimozione dai sistemi live e di backup.
Nota:
Firebase Crashlytics archivia i dati minidump solo temporaneamente per elaborare gli arresti anomali di NDK.
Collegamenti dinamici Firebase
Specifiche del dispositivo (iOS)
Indirizzi IP (iOS)
A cosa serve:
Dynamic Links utilizza le specifiche del dispositivo e gli indirizzi IP su iOS per aprire le app appena installate in una pagina o in un contesto specifico.
Conservazione:
Dynamic Links memorizza solo temporaneamente le specifiche del dispositivo e gli indirizzi IP, per fornire il servizio.
Hosting Firebase
Indirizzi IP
A cosa serve:
l'hosting utilizza gli indirizzi IP delle richieste in arrivo per rilevare abusi e fornire ai clienti un'analisi dettagliata dei dati di utilizzo.
Conservazione:
l'hosting conserva i dati IP per alcuni mesi.
Monitoraggio delle prestazioni di Firebase
ID di installazione di Firebase
Indirizzi IP
A cosa serve:
il monitoraggio delle prestazioni utilizza gli ID di installazione Firebase per calcolare il numero di installazioni Firebase univoche che accedono alle risorse di rete, per garantire che i modelli di accesso siano sufficientemente anonimi. Utilizza inoltre gli ID di installazione Firebase con Firebase Remote Config per gestire la velocità di reporting degli eventi di prestazione. Inoltre, utilizza gli indirizzi IP per mappare gli eventi di performance nei paesi da cui provengono. Per ulteriori informazioni, vedere
Raccolta dati
.
Conservazione:
il monitoraggio delle prestazioni conserva gli eventi associati all'IP per 30 giorni e i dati sulle prestazioni associati all'installazione e non identificati per 90 giorni prima di iniziare il processo di rimozione dai sistemi attivi e di backup.
Messaggistica in-app Firebase
ID di installazione di Firebase
A cosa serve:
la messaggistica in-app Firebase utilizza gli ID di installazione Firebase per determinare a quali dispositivi recapitare i messaggi.
Conservazione:

Database in tempo reale Firebase
Indirizzi IP
Agenti utente
A cosa serve:
Realtime Database utilizza indirizzi IP e agenti utente per abilitare lo
strumento profiler
, che aiuta i clienti Firebase a comprendere le tendenze di utilizzo e i guasti della piattaforma.
Conservazione:
Realtime Database conserva gli indirizzi IP e le informazioni sull'agente utente per alcuni giorni, a meno che un cliente non scelga di salvarli per un periodo più lungo.
Configurazione remota Firebase
ID di installazione di Firebase
A cosa serve:
Remote Config utilizza gli ID di installazione Firebase per selezionare i valori di configurazione da restituire ai dispositivi degli utenti finali.
Conservazione:
Firebase conserva gli ID di installazione Firebase finché il cliente Firebase non effettua una chiamata API per eliminare l'ID. Dopo la chiamata, i dati vengono rimossi dai sistemi live e di backup entro 180 giorni.
FirebaseML
Immagini caricate
token di autenticazione dell'installazione
A cosa serve:
le API basate su cloud archiviano temporaneamente le immagini caricate, per elaborarle e restituirti l'analisi. Le immagini archiviate vengono generalmente eliminate entro poche ore. Per ulteriori informazioni, consulta le
domande frequenti sull'utilizzo dei dati
di Cloud Vision.
I token di autenticazione dell'installazione
vengono utilizzati da Firebase ML per l'autenticazione del dispositivo quando si interagisce con le istanze dell'app, ad esempio per distribuire modelli sviluppatore alle istanze dell'app.
Conservazione:
i token di autenticazione dell'installazione rimangono validi fino alla data di scadenza. La durata predefinita del token è una settimana.

Guide per abilitare il consenso esplicito al trattamento dei dati degli utenti finali
I servizi nella tabella sopra necessitano di una certa quantità di dati degli utenti finali per funzionare. Di conseguenza, non è possibile disattivare completamente la raccolta dei dati durante l'utilizzo di tali servizi.
Se sei un cliente che desidera offrire agli utenti la possibilità di aderire a un servizio e alla raccolta dati che ne deriva, nella maggior parte dei casi è sufficiente aggiungere una finestra di dialogo o attivare/disattivare le impostazioni prima di utilizzare il servizio.
Alcuni servizi, tuttavia, si avviano automaticamente quando inclusi in un'app. Per offrire agli utenti la possibilità di aderire prima di utilizzare tali servizi, puoi scegliere di disabilitare l'inizializzazione automatica per ciascun servizio e di inizializzarli manualmente in fase di esecuzione. Per scoprire come fare, leggi le guide qui sotto:
Messaggistica cloud:
impedisci l'inizializzazione automatica (Android)
o
impedisci l'inizializzazione automatica (iOS+)
Crashlytics:
attiva i report di attivazione (iOS+)
o
attiva i report di attivazione (Android)
Monitoraggio delle prestazioni:
attiva il monitoraggio opt-in
Se integri Firebase con Google Analytics, scopri come
configurare la raccolta dati di Analytics
.
Luoghi di archiviazione ed elaborazione dei dati
A meno che un servizio o una funzionalità non offra la selezione della posizione dei dati, Firebase può elaborare e archiviare i tuoi dati ovunque Google o i suoi agenti abbiano strutture. Le potenziali ubicazioni delle strutture variano in base al servizio.
Servizi solo negli Stati Uniti
Il servizio di autenticazione Firebase viene eseguito solo dai data center statunitensi. Di conseguenza, Firebase Authentication elabora i dati esclusivamente negli Stati Uniti.
Servizi globali
La maggior parte dei servizi Firebase viene eseguita sull'infrastruttura globale di Google. Potrebbero elaborare i dati in qualsiasi
sede di Google Cloud Platform
o
nei data center di Google
. Per alcuni servizi è possibile effettuare una specifica
selezione della posizione dei dati
che limita l'elaborazione a quella posizione.

We collect your personal data so that we can provide you the content you purchase, download, or want to update in the App Store and other Apple online stores, including the iTunes Store and Apple Books.
We also use information about your account, purchases, and downloads in the stores to offer advertising to ensure that ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks, where available, are relevant to you. You have choices with respect to this advertising, as described below.
We use information about your purchases, downloads, and other activities in the stores to tailor features, offer personalized recommendations, and send you notifications including for Apple marketing. You can opt out of the use of this data for this purpose, as described below.
To help identify and prevent fraud, information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive, will be used to compute a device trust score when you attempt a purchase. The submissions are designed so Apple cannot learn the real values on your device. The scores are stored for a fixed time on our servers.
To find ways to improve the stores, we use information about your browsing, purchases, searches, and downloads. These records may be stored with IP address, a random unique identifier (where that arises), and Apple Account when you are signed in to the App Store or other Apple online stores.
Providing the Stores
We use your personal data to provide the services and features in the App Store and other Apple online stores. This information includes, for example, your account and payment information, which you can access and change in settings, and your purchase history.
We may also use your personal data to provide certain services that you request, such as refund requests. These can include refund requests that you send directly to Apple or that you send to Apple as facilitated by app developers. With your consent, developers may provide certain personal data to Apple to assist with processing these refund requests, such as whether you used the purchase.
When you download an app from the App Store, or install an app on your Apple Watch, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple along with your Apple Account. Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location in order to determine whether certain apps that are subject to legal restrictions in some regions can be made available to you.
Improving the Stores
To improve and optimize the experience in the App Store and other Apple online stores, apps, and services, we collect information about your usage of the stores, including when you open or close the App Store, what content you search for, the content you view and download, and your interactions with App Store push notifications and badges, as well as messages from the App Store within apps. We also collect information about your device such as the type of device, the version of your operating system, and the amount of free space on your device. We may use this information in the following ways, for example:
To offer trending searches and personalized features like More Games You Might Like
To assess whether requested content can be downloaded
To understand general trends in the use of device storage, and whether your device is connected by Wi-Fi or cellular
We may also use your ratings and reviews of apps on the App Store and what you search for to improve models that power the App Store. For example, app reviews and aggregated search queries from you and other App Store users are used to provide review summaries and to fine-tune the App Store search model.
Personalizing the Stores
We use your interactions with the App Store to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend content that we think will be of interest to you based on what you’ve previously searched for, viewed, downloaded, updated, or reviewed in the App Store. We also use your purchase history, including in-app purchases, subscriptions, and payment methods together with account information derived from your Apple Account, such as the devices you use and new devices you activate. To make better recommendations, we also use aggregate information about app launches, installs, and deletions from users who choose to share device analytics with Apple, and aggregate information about app ratings. The App Store uses local, on-device processing to enhance our recommendations. Using app usage data stored on your device — such as the apps you frequently open, the time you spend using certain apps, and your app installs and uninstalls — the App Store can suggest apps and in-app events that are more relevant to you. The information Apple receives about your usage of the stores includes information about the personalized content you tap and view.
You can turn off personalization features in the App Store, Apple Books, the iTunes Store, Apple TV, Podcasts, and for subscriptions from Apple by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, and then tap to turn off Personalized Recommendations. You can clear the app usage data logged on your device for personalization on iOS and iPadOS devices by going to Settings > App Store > Personalized Recommendations and tapping Clear App Usage Data. This will not delete data logged on your device, but any data logged at the point when you clear your app usage data will no longer be used for personalization. The App Store personalization features will use new data logged after you cleared your app usage data history.
Communicating with You
Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about the App Store and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. Apple may also use information about your activity within the App Store to send you communications about new features, content, and offers available on the App Store.
Email Marketing
You may receive these communications by email, if you consent to receive email marketing. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to
account.apple.com
, or on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information > Communication Preferences.
Push Notifications
You may also receive these communications by push notification. To update your notification preferences or to opt out of notifications on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > App Store.
Advertising
Apple-delivered advertising helps people discover apps, products, and services on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. We use information about your device, account, purchases, subscriptions, and previous downloads to ensure that ads are relevant. On the App Store, we may also use contextual information, including your search terms when you run a search, and information about the page you are viewing or the app you are downloading, to serve you a relevant ad. We create groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and we use these groups for delivering targeted ads. Information about you is used to determine which segments you are assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, targeted ads are delivered only if more than 5,000 people meet the targeting criteria. The information used to determine which ads are relevant to you is tied to random identifiers and not tied to your Apple Account.
When selecting which ad to display on the App Store from multiple ads for which you are eligible, we may use some of the above mentioned information, as well as your App Store searches and browsing activity, to determine which ad is likely to be most relevant to you. App Store browsing activity includes information like the content and apps you tap and view while browsing the App Store. This information is aggregated across users so that it does not identify you. We may also use local, on-device processing to select which ad to display, using information stored on your device, such as the apps you frequently open. Apple’s advertising platform receives information about the ads you tap and view against a random identifier not tied to your Apple Account.
If you allow App Store to access your location, your approximate location may be used to provide geographically targeted ads on the App Store. You can opt out of location-based functionality at any time on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > App Store, then tapping Never.
If the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use your information to serve ads that are more relevant to you. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to turn off Personalized Ads. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

Sharing with Third Parties
We are obligated to provide some non-personal data to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf to display in the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. For example, we may share non-personal data about your content purchases with app developers so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services.
We may share information with developers to help them operate and improve their apps. Developers can access usage information, provided by users who opt in, that allows them to look at aggregated data from groups of users that have similar characteristics or behavior, as long as the data comes from groups of no less than five users. Developers can also access receipt information for purchases and refunds of their products and services in the App Store. The receipts provided to developers do not include personal data; however, developers could seek to associate them with personal data from your use and download of their apps, if you have provided it to them.
If you purchase a subscription in a third-party app, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. We use the Subscriber ID to provide reports to the developer that include information about the subscription you purchased and your country or region of residence. This information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions. If you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer, and if you don’t resubscribe, the Subscriber ID will be reset after 180 days.
In certain regions, if you make an external purchase for digital goods or services for an app, meaning your purchase is not made with Apple’s in-app payment system, the app developer for that app will report to Apple information about the purchase, including amount paid and item purchased, for Apple’s accounting, reporting, and analytics purposes. Apple does not link the purchase information to your Apple Account.
In addition, when automatic downloads of in-app content from app developers occur, your device’s IP address will be visible to the app developer before the app is first opened. The handling of your IP address by the app developer is governed by the app developer’s privacy policies. To turn off automatic downloads of in-app content from developers before you first open an app, go to Settings > App Store, then tap to turn off In-App Content.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your personal data in the App Store generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.
Where applicable local law provides, we process personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party in order to:
Display relevant content, assess whether your device has enough space to download requested content, and facilitate automatic downloads of updated content
Help improve and optimize the App Store and other Apple products and services for you and others
Send you offers via email and push notifications that may be of interest to you, and to create segments to serve you ads in the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks
Process refund requests
Provide reporting to developers on purchases in their apps
Prevent fraud and other malicious activity
The data used includes:
Your use of the App Store app, such as your interactions with content you search for, view, download, and purchase, as well as App Store notifications and messages and in-app notifications and messages
Details about your device and account
Your IP address
The device trust score
Retention
We retain personal data associated with your purchases and downloads on the App Store and other Apple online stores for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to download that content, again in line with our applicable terms. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for a shorter period. The period chosen takes account of applicable legal requirements to retain data and specific business use cases. However, some information, such as purchases but not your stored card details, may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the App Store.
When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.
Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity
We also collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the App Store and other Apple online stores, and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, searches, and other interactions with the stores.
When you initiate a purchase, or when a subscription is set to auto-renew, Apple may use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process the request and determine whether to provide the product or service in advance of authorization by the payment partner.
We also compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
