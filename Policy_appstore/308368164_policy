Types of personal data and processing purposes
The Proloquo applications are software applications through which the person that uses Proloquo to speak (i.e. the “AAC User”) is supported by a group of people, typically the parents, teacher and care professionals (the “AAC Team”). The AAC User’s vocabulary, app usage, and app usage preferencessettings are shared among the authorized AAC Team members. Specific AAC Team members with an ‘admin’ role control who is part of the AAC Team and the amount of information that will be shared. AssistiveWare, nor other third parties have direct access to these files.
When you access and use our Proloquo applications, we will collect and process personal data in the ways as explained in more detail here below:
AssistiveWare account
Information you provide to us. When you register for an AssistiveWare account in order to make use of the application(s), we collect and process the personal data you provide, such as your name, email address, country of residence.
In the event you create an account on behalf of a school/university or care institution, we may also ask for additional (predominantly optional) information, such as name and type of the organization, your role within the organization, license or certification information.
As AAC Team admin you are the primary administrator and able to appoint the AAC User and other AAC Team members. All other AAC Team members may also register for an AssistiveWare account via an invitation link (as received from the AAC Team admin).
AAC User generated data is not stored on an AssistiveWare Account. The AAC User only has an AssistiveWare Account if they are made part of the AAC Team themselves.
The legal basis for processing these types of personal data can be found in (the preparation of) providing you with a license and/or access to the application. In the event access to the applications is provided for through the AAC User’s school, the legal basis for processing personal data is based on consent.
Application use / User (generated) data
Information collected from the use of Proloquo. When the AAC User makes use of our applications, we collect information about the AAC User and the usage of the applications by the AAC User.
Mandatory personal data fields for the AAC User are: first name. The AAC User’s birth year and diagnose are non-mandatory fields. The information about age and/or diagnose is used to improve our products and to have an appropriate conversation with the AAC Team in connection with support request.
To support the use of the application, we collect and store the AAC User’s settings (e.g. pronunciation exceptions), their personalization (user specific words, uploaded photos), and their activity (e.g. the number of times the app is use to speak in a certain time frame).
Communication messages are created on the hardware device itself and do not use any connection with AssistiveWare or other parties in the generation process. We will never transmit or collect the actual communication (chat transcripts) of the AAC User, nor will we process the communication to extract the essence, meaning or intent of the communicated messages.
The applications allow the AAC Team admin to store a backup of the device data (such as the AAC User’s vocabulary) on a local computer or in third party cloud storage, such as iCloud, Dropbox or Google Drive. AssistiveWare has no access to these back up storages, and is not able to guarantee the protection of personal data in connection with these backups.
Only with the AAC Team admin’s prior consent, we will also collect and process usage statistics, such as, but not limited to, the number of different words spoken in a week, the total number of words spoken in a week, and the number of times words from a list of 120 core words are spoken. This anonymized information can be used to improve our products (e.g. accessibility and usability of the application, features and settings), for research publications and/or as a parameter for monitoring the development of the AAC User in relation to its peersto provide feedback on the AAC Users language development.
To support the use of Proloquo Coach the application stores the progress a AAC User makes in the application, as well as the communication with AssistiveWare’s support team.
The legal basis for processing these types of personal data can be found in the execution of our agreement with you regarding the use of the applications, or by consent (e.g. depending on the context of home versus school use) given by a parent or guardian.

We let the device administrator or team admin control the collection and use of the user generated data of the minor via the AssistiveWare applications, in particular by making them responsible for providing the various types of data, and for selecting the individuals with whom such user (generated) data may be shared or not;
We limit the collection and processing of personal data of minors as much as possible, in any event no more than is necessary to make reasonable use of the minimum features in the applications;
In the event our applications are being used by schools and/or universities, we shall only act as ‘processor’ and adhere to the instructions of the school and/or university.
Personal data we share with third parties
We will never sell your personal data to third parties, nor will we use or share your personal data for third party advertising, -profiling or -marketing purposes. Your personal data will only be shared with third parties in the following circumstances:
where we engage external suppliers, service / hosting providers, support members or advisors for the benefit of our service performance ("(sub-)processors");
(government) authorities or organizations to whom we must disclose certain personal data on the basis of a legal obligation.
Where applicable, we have concluded data processing agreements and/or confidentiality agreements with service providers or third parties involved in connection with the use of the applications, wherein we only permit them to process personal data subject to and in accordance with specific instructions.
The personal data will be collected and processed through servers located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United States of America (USA). In the event personal data under the responsibility of AssistiveWare as the ‘controller’, is being transferred to countries or third parties outside the EEA, we will take into account the statutory requirements in relation thereto. This may for example include the existence of EU standard contractual clauses.
Protection and retention of personal data
We have taken adequate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against loss and the unauthorized access or misuse thereof. Amongst others we use encryption and SSL for security. We also have two-factor authentication (2FA) where applicable, access management, and we have internal guidelines for our personnel regarding the use and processing of personal data and what to do in the event of a data breach.
We retain your personal data no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we have collected the personal data, or in correspondence with an applicable statutory retention term. You may at all times request the removal of your personal data. We will respond to such request within the statutory timeframe.
Your rights
You have the right to request access to or the amendment, deletion or data transfer of your personal data. You may also submit a request to restrict or object to certain data processing. You furthermore have the right to withdraw any previously provided consent.
You may direct any requests or complaints regarding the processing of your personal data to us via the contact details as provided in this privacy statement. We will respond to such requests within the applicable statutory timeframes. For completeness, we also note that you have the right to submit a complaint with the relevant data protection authority in your country of residence.
Changes
We reserve the right to unilaterally amend this privacy statement to ensure compliance with the GDPR and/or other applicable data protection laws. It is recommended that you consult this privacy statement on a regular basis in order to be aware of any potential changes. If we make material changes to how we process your personal data, we will send you a notification thereof. Your continued use of the application(s) after changes to the privacy statement will deemed to be your acceptance of such changes.

In this privacy statement we will explain which types of personal data we collect, for which purposes and how we protect such data to the best of our abilities.

Types of personal data and processing purposes
App functionality
The application does not communicate any personal information to AssistiveWare or other third parties, except when the functionality to share a story using the Pictello Sharing Server is used.
Stories shared with other users using the Pictello Sharing Server are stored on AssistiveWare's servers in Europe. AssistiveWare will not disclose the contents of the stories shared. Only the people that receive a story code from the person that uploaded the story can download the story. AssistiveWare may perform anonymous analysis on the stories shared in order to improve the application.
Data backup
The application allows the user to store a backup of the user’s vocabulary on a third party cloud storage, such as iCloud, Dropbox or Google Drive. AssistiveWare has no access to these storages, and the responsibility to keep the data secure remains under full control of the user.
Anonymous data collection
In order to improve the application we collect data on the application usage, including, but not limited to, the application version, device information, application settings and application usage statistics. This data is not linked to the person using the product, nor can it be used to disclose the identity of the user. Under no circumstances will AssistiveWare collect conversation transcripts.
After explicit consent the application may share more than basic app usage information with AssistiveWare. This data will not contain any conversations, and is processed strictly anonymous. The data is used to improve our products, and may be used for research and publication. A description of the data collected can be found at
Anonymous data collection in AssistiveWare apps
.
Support
When you create a support request, we collect the personal data you provide, such as name, email address and potentially other (contact) details you voluntarily provide to us. This information will be used to contact you and/or follow up on a support request.

We recognize that there are many situation where privacy can be at stake. We do our best to minimize the risks of compromising someone's privacy in our applications, support system, and the information we provide through our website and social media channels.
If you have any concerns regarding the way we deal with privacy, or any related topic, please feel free to address this at

For our iOS keyboards we would like to address some specific details in this document.
AssistiveWare's iOS Keyboards
Please know that the keyboard itself and the application to install the keyboard are two separate pieces of software on the device:
- A keyboard extension that provides an input method to be used in other applications. We will refer to this as "the keyboard".
- An application that allows the user to install and uninstall the keyboard. We will refer to this as "the container application".
Apple also enforces the security of keyboards, by asking the user to allow Full Access for a keyboard, if the keyboard wants to use certain features.
If Full Access is not granted the keyboard cannot communicate with other applications, not even with it's own container application. It will not have access to services on the device, such as Services or Address Book, and it does not have access to networking (the internet).
The Keedogo and Keedogo Plus keyboards currently do not request Full Access and thus run in this safe restricted mode.
If Full Access is granted the keyboard can have access to the device, to networking (the internet) and can communicate with the container application, but is not required to use all these features.
The Keeble keyboard does request full access, but uses this only for two features: to be able to generate a click sound when keys are tapped and to allow the container application to change the keyboard's options.
Keedogo
The text written using the keyboard will not be stored on the device by the keyboard application.
The keyboard cannot access data from other applications, such as Location Services or Address Book, nor can it connect to the internet.
Keedogo Plus
When using the word prediction or word completion feature the words written using the keyboard will be stored in a database that is accessible to the keyboard only. No other application on the device, including the container application, will have access to this database. The stored data will only be used for the purpose of word prediction and word completion. No other analysis on this data is performed.
Note that the prediction database is private to the keyboard, but not to the user. Words typed by one user of the device may turn up in prediction and completion for other users if the device is shared by multiple users.
The keyboard cannot access data from other applications, such as Location Services or Address Book, nor can it connect to the internet.
The keyboard cannot export any data off the device itself. The prediction database however may be contained in device backups (such as, but not limited to, iCloud and iTunes backups). A restore on another device may move the prediction database to another device.
Keeble
When using the word prediction or word completion feature the words written using the keyboard will be stored in a database that is accessible to the keyboard only. No other application on the device will have access to this database. The stored data will only be used for the purpose of word prediction and word completion. No other analysis on this data is performed.
Note that the prediction database is private to the keyboard, but not to the user. Words typed by one user of the device may turn up in prediction and completion for other users if the device is shared by multiple users.
The keyboard requires full access to the iOS in order to be able to use the sound output of the device for auditory feedback, and to share its configuration settings with the container application. The keyboard does not use full access for other purposes. The keyboard does not access data from other applications, such as Location Services or Address Book, and does not connect to the internet.
The keyboard will not export any data off the device itself. The prediction database however may be contained in device backups (such as, but not limited to, iCloud and iTunes backups). A restore on another device may move the prediction database to another device.
Note that this privacy statement may change with future versions of the keyboards. This privacy statement was last updated on: 29 October 2014

A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other similar technologies on our Websites or emails to, among other things:
Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;
Collect statistics regarding your Website usage;
Provide us with information to support technical functionality of service, improve the Website experience and measure marketing effectiveness; and
In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain Websites owned by such third parties.
There are several different kinds of cookies, and should we be deploying cookies we (or a third party provider be deploying them in connection with our ecommerce activities) would be using one of the following common types of cookies, which may be persistent cookies or session cookies:
Essential cookies
are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our Websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.
Analytics or customization cookies
collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the Website for you.
Advertising cookies and tracking scripts
are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.
If the Website includes a cookie management tool, you will typically find a hover button at the bottom of your screen. If in the future you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our Websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.
Do-Not-Track.
There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that our Websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals. For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit

When you access one of our Websites, which contains a Plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The content of the Plugin is transferred by the respective Provider directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the Website. Integration of the Plugin allows the Provider to receive the information that you have accessed the respective Website even if you do not maintain a profile with that Provider or if you are not logged in at the moment. This information (including your IP address) will be transferred by your browser directly to the Provider in the U.S. and stored there. If you are logged in with one of the Providers’ services, they will be able to assign your visit on our Website to your profile with the respective Provider. If you interact with any of the Plugins, e.g. by pressing the ‟Like” or the ‟+1” button, this information will also be sent directly to the server of the Provider and stored there. The information will also be published in the social network on your respective account, e.g. Twitter, and displayed to your contacts there.
For more information on the purpose and extent of the data acquisition and how data are processed and used by the respective Provider as well as regarding your rights and optional settings to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policies of the respective Provider:

You can prevent the loading of the Plugins completely by using Add-Ons for your browser, e.g. the script-blocker ‟NoScript” (

On behalf of the Website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website provider. Google will not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data stored by Google.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website. Furthermore, you can prevent the acquisition of data collected by cookies and relating to your use of the Website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under

When we make products available for sale through an Ecommerce Engine, we are doing so as an independent ecommerce reSeller of, or service provider for, the partner whose name and/or logo appears as part of the particular Ecommerce Engine. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate that is co-branded with our partner’s branding, we will provide certain of the Personal Information and/or anonymous information you provide in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have previously consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this Ecommerce Engine such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this Ecommerce Engine and our partner’s Website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you. We may also provide certain of the Personal Information you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this Ecommerce Engine.  The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you purchase, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your Personal Information that we provide to them.
Our Service Providers
. We use other companies, which may include but are not limited to present or future corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or on our behalf and help us to operate our business. We may share your information with our service providers in connection with their provision of services to us. We may also allow these companies to use anonymous information, and to use aggregated Personal Information on an anonymous basis (i.e., where the aggregated data cannot identify you personally), for their business purposes.  We will not share your Personal Information with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent. We select our partners and service providers on the basis of their security and confidentiality commitments and their compliance with data protection laws.
To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Ecommerce Engine, You and Others
. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Information we collect on this Ecommerce Engine without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a)  to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; (b) to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; (c) to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); (d) to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (e) to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of FastSpring, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or (f) to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are or may be in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations without providing notice to you. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose Personal Information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In Connection With Corporate Events/Transitions
. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, your Personal Information may become owned by that company in compliance with applicable data protection laws. In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your Personal Information will still be subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Supplemental Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
We do not sell your Personal Information.
5. Security of Your Personal Information
We are committed to keeping your Personal Information secure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative safeguards reasonably designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a financial account number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. We encrypt Personal Information whenever possible and otherwise restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and individuals with a need to know that information.  It is important that you understand, however, that no Ecommerce Engine, Website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your password. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements. Please know, however, that no matter where your Personal Information is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through this Ecommerce Engine, it will be protected by us in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, any Supplemental Privacy Notices that apply to you, and applicable data protection laws.
Cross-Border Transfers of Your Data.
As we operate internationally, and provide you with relevant services through our resources and servers around the globe, sharing your Personal Information across borders is essential. Your Personal Information will be processed on the computer servers (currently Amazon Web Services) in the United States of America on which our Ecommerce Engine is hosted.  In some cases, we may transmit your Personal Information to (i) third party data processors or (ii) product manufacturers, licensors and/or suppliers for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement. To the extent required by applicable data protection laws, we have executed standard contractual clauses to effect the lawful cross-border transfer of personal information.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Compliance.
FastSpring complies with the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. FastSpring has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF program Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, FastSpring commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information transferred to the United States pursuant to the DPF Principles. European Union individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints should first contact FastSpring at
privacy@fastspring.com
.
FastSpring has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers
for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See
https://dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2
.
As explained here we sometimes provide Personal Information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer Personal Information received under the EU-U.S. DPF to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the Personal Information must also be in compliance with our EU-U.S. DPF obligations. Therefore, third parties that use our products explicitly agree to abide by the EU-U.S. DPF or otherwise agree to execute the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission for the purposes of transferring Personal Information from the EU to non-adequate countries outside the EU.
Where the EU-U.S. DPF is not applicable, including when there are transfers from the United Kingdom (UK) or Switzerland, FastSpring executes the Standard Contractual Clauses for the purposes of lawful transfer of personal data as set out in European Commission Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021, as well as the UK International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses as issued by the UK Information Commissioner under S119A(1) Data Protection Act 2018 (as applicable to any transfers from the UK to non-adequate third countries).
Data Retention Policies
.
We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information in accordance with applicable laws.
6. Your Rights & Choices with Respect to Your Personal Information
Your Rights.
Based upon where you reside, certain choices and rights with regards to your Personal Information may be available to you or your authorized agent under applicable data protection laws, such as the GDPR or California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
Access Request Rights
You have the right to request that we provide to you the following information about our collection and use of your personal information :
1. The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you.

3. Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information.
4. The categories of third parties with whom we share or have shared that Personal Information.
5. The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request), and
6. Information regarding any disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion, Rectification and Restriction Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete, restrict or, if you believe that our processing of your Personal Information is incorrect or inaccurate, change any of the Personal Information collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.  Once your verifiable consumer request is confirmed, we will delete, restrict or change, as the case may be, and direct our service providers to delete, restrict or change your Personal Information.  Your request to delete the Personal Information collected may be denied if it is necessary for us to retain your information under one or more of the exceptions listed in the GDPR or CCPA.
Data Portability Rights
In some cases, you may receive your Personal Information provided by yourself in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
Right to Object
Where we process your Personal Information based on a "legitimate interest", you may have the legal right to object to the processing of your Personal Information.

We reserve the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if the disclosure may lead to a breach of applicable law and regulation, e.g. in case of any legal obligation to retain certain data, or if you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to verify your identity.
Your Choices.
FastSpring respects your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose information about you. We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time, and on the page, where you provide your Personal Information. When you provide Personal Information, we may offer you a choice as to whether you would like to receive further communications from us and/or from our partners via a box to tick for example, such as communications related to updates, upgrades, special offers and pricing. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you decide you no longer want to receive promotional messages from us, you may let us know by e-mailing us at
remove@fastspring.com
or by following any unsubscribe link in our e-mails; please specify which consent you are revoking in your e-mail to us. Please note, however, if you give us permission to add your contact information to our partner’s mailing list and later withdraw your permission, you will have to contact our partner (or use the “opt-out” provided in the e-mails our partner sends you) to have your name removed from our partner’s mailing lists.
7. Links to Third Party Websites
FastSpring’s Website provides links to third-party web sites, which are not under the control of FastSpring. FastSpring makes no representations about third-party web sites. When you access a non-FastSpring website, you do so at your own risk. FastSpring is not responsible for the reliability of any data, opinions, advice, or statements made on third-party sites. FastSpring provides these links merely as a convenience. The inclusion of such links does not imply that FastSpring endorses, recommends, or accepts any responsibility for the content of such sites.
