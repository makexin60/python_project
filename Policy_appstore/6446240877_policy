Gathered Data Automatically Collected (“Automated Information”): We may automatically collect such information via cookies and other techniques.
Please see our Cookies Policy for more information on cookies. In addition to cookies, such other technologies may include:
"Pixel tags" or "clear GIFs," also called web beacons, are minuscule images (normally one-pixel) that can appear on a webpage or in an electronic communication. They help us measure the potency of our content by keeping track of how many people visit our website and confirming whether you've opened any emails from us or seen any pages we have.
HTML5, the coding language commonly used by mobile websites, can be used to collect data regarding your website use and habits. This information is essential in order for us to analyze how well our services are being utilized and what improvements may need to be made while also allowing us to personalize the experience we provide you with. The tracking technologies implemented on our behalf come from third-party service providers discussed further in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.
Automated Information includes information such as:
IP address
Operating system used (for example: iOS)
Internal resolution of the browser window
Device type
Country code
Identifiers associated with technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address)
Dates and times of access
IDFA
Subscription information
To better understand your behavior and ensure that any collected data is accurate, we or our third-party service provider may assign you a unique identifier. This will allow us to combine information acquired from various sources at different times - both personal details as well as Automated Information - and use it as stated in this Privacy Policy.
This Automated Information is generally used for the following purposes:
We take the necessary technical steps to ensure that your experience on our website and mobile applications is safe, secure, user-friendly, and constantly improving. We use insights of customer usage data to develop new products and features as well as improve existing ones. In addition, we make sure you have easy access to all our Services online or via a mobile device.
We personalize our Services to better suit your needs, as well as gain a deeper understanding of both existing and potential customers in order to optimize our marketing strategies. Additionally, we capture events and usage data for internal business analytics purposes; allowing us to track user interaction with the mobile application, such as when they visit certain screens or permit notifications. This helps us evaluate how successful our services are so that we can make necessary improvements going forward.
To ensure effective communication, we monitor and analyze emails sent to you in order to identify when they are received or read. Additionally, our Services include information from third-party sources integrated into them for the purpose of providing better access. This includes personal data collected from these sources that is necessary for us to fulfill our services.
You're given the option to conveniently access or register for our services through your third-party social networks like Facebook and Google. If you select this alternative, your preferred platform may allow us to access certain information associated with your account such as email address or a unique identifier. We might also be asked to share some of the data we have on record with these platforms. By signing up through your third-party social media provider, you give us permission to collect and process information from the said provider in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We also have authorization to share such details as needed so that you can access our services using your preferred account. To better protect yourself, we urge you to read your social media provider's privacy policies thoroughly before utilizing their service for connecting with us.

4. HOW WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WITH OTHERS
To ensure your privacy is respected, we may share information about you for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or a special "in-time" notice provided when we collect the data.
Third Party Service Providers
In order to provide you with the best possible service and administer your account, we may share certain information about you with specific third-party providers for diverse business purposes. These include customer communications platforms that receive phone numbers, emails, application usage data and interactions. This allows us to keep in contact with you as well as track your utilization of our services for internal analytics.
To facilitate our understanding of app utilization and interactions, we employ a third-party internal business analytics platform. This empowers us to draw invaluable insights that enable us to upgrade our features and product offering. For the purpose of providing services regarding these matters, unique user identifiers (IDFA, device ID, IP address etc.), as well as events related to your subscription with us might be shared or made available with these service providers (i) monitor and understand usage in order to enhance existing Services or develop new products and features and (ii) better understand our customers in order to market our products more effectively.
When you reach out to us via one of our support emails listed in the "How to Contact Us" section at the bottom of this Privacy Policy, your email may be routed through a third party customer service platform. This provider will have access to your personal info, as well as any content and data associated with your inquiry. We rely on them for communication between yourself and our team regarding account details, plus they also provide reports relating to product quality or safety.
With Measurement and Attribution, these providers offer us the ability to identify where new subscription sign ups originate from and gain insight into how our apps are being used. By utilizing unique user IDs given by third-party service providers, we're able to measure ad performance accurately (such as which source acquired a specific user) while obtaining information on customer app usage which helps enhance their quality and safety. We may also share and/or store unique user identifiers, device IDs, IDFA or IP addresses with these providers for the same purpose.
To deliver our services, we partner with other technology providers that provide cloud storage and web hosting. We may also make anonymous or aggregate Automated Information available to monitor network traffic for malicious activities such as malware, fraudulence and unlawful practices. Through this measure, we strive to protect all of our customers' data from any form of disruption or misuse.
When you choose to purchase our services outside of the Apple or Google stores, we direct and authorize your payment through a third-party provider. As an illustration, Braintree (https://www.braintreepayments.com/) is one of our payment partners that processes payments securely and efficiently on behalf of us both. To ensure successful transactions are completed every time with no problems along the way, please note we will need to share specific information like your email address with them for receipt delivery as well as possible issues resolution among other matters about your payment process if any arise in future interactions between us two parties involved.
To ensure you receive the best marketing strategies for our products, we may utilize third-party service providers and will use your data to do so. Furthermore, with your permission, we are able to create and share certain information such as Custom or Lookalike Audiences with Facebook. If you'd like more details on this process - including how to opt out of having off-Facebook activity sent over - read up on their Privacy Policy here. For further understanding of Facebook's Lookalike Audience feature click here! Additionally, if we obtain your information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes, event, offering or other promotional activity that is jointly offered by us and any third parties. When you consent to our contest or sweepstakes, we will provide your information to a joint sponsor. Additionally, we may share it with an external service provider who manages the promotion and/or competition. Moreover, in order for us to gain insight into our user demographics - including interests, behaviors and usage patterns of certain services - aggregate data might be shared with third-party providers or platforms; this way marketing can increase efficiency when promoting products.
Corporate Transactions
In the unlikely scenario of a Corporate Transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, bankruptcy, liquidation sale, reorganization or wind-down of our business; we may be required to share information concerning you. However, when permissible by law we reserve the right to transfer any personal data which is under our control in connection with said Corporate Transactions. In the event of a sale or transfer, we will do our best to ensure that your personal data is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. After such an activity has occurred, you are entitled to contact the recipient regarding any questions about how they process your information.
Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Similar reasons.
We may need to disclose or share your information in order to adhere with legal, regulatory, compliance and similar standards. This includes complying with court orders, judicial subpoenas or other related warrants; meeting industry expectations; adhering to our company policies; safeguarding against any frauds, illegal activities (including responding incidents of hacking or misusing websites/mobile apps) as well as reporting adverse events and handling potential liabilities.
In order to protect our company, we reserve the right to reveal your personal information if it is necessary for liability avoidance or defense of legal rights. Furthermore, in accordance with both this Privacy Policy and any applicable laws that may apply, we are able to collect and share your data as required by yourself or those you have granted permission to do so.
5. DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES
Although some web browsers generate "do-not-track" signals to the sites that users interact with, their intentions and even knowledge of these mechanisms may be unpredictable. As there is still no industry standard regarding how websites should react when they detect such messages, our services do not currently recognize or respond to them. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
Third parties, including ad networks, web analytics services, and social media platforms, may collect your online data across various websites. Even if you set DNT settings on your browser, these third parties are not obligated to honor it. However, with some simple steps outlined under "Information collected by automated means" above ,you can opt-out of having your information used by third-party entities.
6. SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS
On several social networking and blogging platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter Snap TikTok and Pinterest we remain active. We can even include third-party features in our Services (allowing people to interact with one another and share content) or use third-party provided platforms for managing the Services or specific parts of them. This Privacy Policy also applies to the information we acquire or share through these platforms and features. Moreover, some third-party social media providers that we utilize may have their own privacy policies which explain how they may collect, use, and protect your data (if you create an account with them directly). If you choose to take advantage of any social functionalities on our sites, then you agree to abide by those third-parties' terms of service and respective privacy policies.
When you decide to communicate with us or another user through any of our social media pages, applications, messaging services, and other similar features; please keep in mind that this information may be publicly available. For your safety and security, it is recommended that you do not include any passwords or other sensitive data such as credit card numbers and social security numbers when using these features. Additionally, we reserve the right--though are not obligated--to monitor messages between users for training purposes. We may, but are not obligated to, remove any content we deem inappropriate.

Specifically, head to the "Information for Individuals in the European Economic Area" section if you're an EEA resident or visit the "Information for Residents of California" portion if you live in The Golden State.
In certain locations, if you are not an EEA or California resident, you may have the ability to request access to and/or correct any personal information that has been provided to AST Mobile Ltd. For your protection and privacy, we will require valid evidence of identity as well as proof of residence prior to responding appropriately.

Device permissions
When it comes to your mobile device, there are permission settings like camera and microphone permissions as well as push notifications that you can choose to enable or disable. Note that if you decide not to allow a certain service access, some features of the app may no longer be available. So take a look at the various permission settings available on your device for maximum control over what data is collected from your phone and which notifications appear on-screen.
Uninstall
To halt all information collection by the app, disable call forwarding and deactivate your account following the instructions on the Service's Settings screen. Then uninstall the application using your device's regular uninstall process. Your mobile device will still store its exclusive identifier even after you uninstalled it. If you reinstall this same application on that exact phone, we will be able to reestablish a link between this identifier and your previous transactions or activities.
Location information
By opting-in, you give us permission to collect your device's real-time location. With that being said, if this is something you are uncomfortable with, you can always manage and adjust your preferences in the app or on your device itself. That way, we will no longer have access to such data from then onwards.
Marketing Opt-Outs
You can make the decision to receive Interest-based Advertising by choosing an opt-out option. To support this, some of our Service Providers that carry out advertisement services for third parties and us may be part of the DAA's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. If you want to know more about how you can exercise your right in regards to serving ads related with Cross-device Data based on Interests, click here http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA's opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Certain companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), so if you'd like to learn more about them and your opt-out options, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please keep in mind that even if you do manage to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, other types of ads may still be delivered to you. Opting out only means that selected NAI members should no longer deliver specific targeted content or advertisements (such as from other ad networks) directly towards you. Furthermore, if your web browser is set up to decline cookies when you visit the opt-out pages or they are wiped out afterwards, using a different device or earlier version of web browser and accessing through a non-browser based method (e.g., mobile app) can possibly nullify your NAI/DAA opt-outs from being in effect.
10. DATA RETENTION

In addition, this storage period may be extended whenever necessary in order to fulfill any contractual obligation or legal and regulatory duties required of us.
