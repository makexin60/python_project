How we protect your data
We know how much trust you place in us when you share your personal data. We place great importance on the security of your personal information and will always take appropriate precautions to protect it. This applies to both the physical security of the data we hold, and the high level of digital security features we use.
Our website uses industry standard software protection and is securely encrypted using SSL, so it cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. When you are on a secure page, a closed lock icon on Web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome will indicate this. Even with these precautions, no data transmission over the internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you disclose to us online, and you must understand that you do so at your own risk.
Where data is backed up we take steps to ensure that it is encrypted and secure. Access to personal information is restricted to employees who need it, and that all staff who handle personal information are fully trained and kept up-to-date on our data management, security, and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure your information is protected.
