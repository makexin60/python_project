What rights do I have regarding the use of my Personal Data?
You have certain rights in relation to how we use your Personal Data. These rights only apply only where Vue processes your Personal Data as a controller, as set out above in this policy.
Individuals located in UK and the EU and EEA, have certain rights regarding their Personal Data, as set out in more detail below. Some of these rights, e.g., the right to be forgotten or the right to request that we transfer your information to another company, will only apply in certain circumstances. Most rights are also subject to certain exceptions and exemptions that may mean that we are not always legally required to comply with your request in part or in full.
Rights
What does this mean?
The right to be informed
You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your Personal Data and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this notice.
The right of access
You have the right to know how we are using your Personal Data, a right to see a copy of the Personal Data we hold for you and a right to be provided with additional information, for example, about how and why we are using your Personal Data and who it is being shared with. This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your Personal Data in accordance with data protection law.
The right to request that any inaccurate Personal Data is amended
If you think that any of the Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete you have the right to request that we amend it.
The right to erasure
This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, basically, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your Personal Data where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure and we have to comply only where:
We are processing your Personal Data because you gave us consent and this is the legal basis we are relying on for such processing; or
Where, on the basis of our assessment, there is no genuine reason for us to continue processing your Personal Data; and
We have no legal obligation to retain the Personal Data you have requested to be deleted.
The right to restrict processing
You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your Personal Data. When processing is restricted, we can still store your Personal information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their Personal Data to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
The right to data portability
You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to request that this data is transmitted to another controller where this is technically feasible. This right only applies to Personal Data you have provided to us yourself (not any other information), that we process by automated means based on your consent or for the performance of a contract with you.

Why do we use cookies and similar technologies?
To make our websites (including our mobile site) and app work better and to distinguish you from other users, we use cookies and similar technologies, such as tagging.  Cookies and similar technologies can perform functions and personalise content.
What is a cookie and what do they do?
A cookie is a small text file which sits on your device or browser and assists with information flow and functionality. We use cookies to support the main and mobile websites and our app.  For instance, some cookies help with site security or provide information to help us improve the site.  Certain cookies can personalise content. Each cookie performs a specific action.
For instance, cookies can send general information about how the site or app is used, which can be used for maintenance and improvement.  These cookies don’t capture your personal data and we wouldn’t be able to identify people from the information.  They simply log numbers and provide grouped information about site or app navigation – this tells us if people can find what they want.
Other cookies remember information from one page to another, so you don’t have to keep entering it.  These are called “session” cookies.  For example ASP.Net is a session cookie which remembers your data from one page.
Cookies which remember things for longer, from one visit to the next, are called “persistent” cookies.  Persistent cookies can do things like remember preferences and adjust content to suit you (personalisation).
What are first and third party cookies?
Cookies can be sent by different parties.
If the cookie comes from our site it is a first party cookie.  If it comes from another site, such as our suppliers or business partners, it is a third-party cookie, specifically chosen by us to provide a service, such as a more personalised visit.
Do I Have to Accept Cookies?
You may reject cookies; however, site and app functions will be affected.  Cookies help our sites and app to work properly and personalise your experience. You’ll be able to browse the sites and app without cookies but some standard functionality, preferences and certain features will not work.
By accepting cookies, you allow us to improve your experience and remember information about you, which can personalise your experience.
To withdraw consent, you can reject or delete cookies. Please see the Managing Your Cookies section below on how you can adjust your browser settings.

2. set some browsers to send you an alert when a website is trying to place a cookie on your browser.
3. block cookies by activating the setting on your browser to refuse all or some cookies.  However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies including strictly necessary cookies, site access and features can be limited or not available.
4. delete cookies stored in your browser by “clearing cookies”.  This will only delete cookies already stored.  It won’t prevent new ones being accepted unless you change the acceptance settings.  Also, clearing your cookies on one browser of one device does not automatically clear them on another.  You need to clear all browsers on all devices, independently.

How long do cookies last?
Different cookies can last for different lengths of time.
Session cookies last for that website visit.  Information is kept from one page to another, so you don’t have to keep entering it.
Persistent cookies are on your browser and may last for a year or until you delete them.  They can personalise the site and remember information each time you visit.  We use them to see how people engage with our site.  It helps us change and develop the site and improve your experience of it.
What different types of cookies does the site use and what are they each for?
Different types of cookies do different things.  We use the following cookies on our sites and apps.
Strictly Necessary Cookies support our websites and app operation.  They are essential when you move around our website or app and use its features. For example, they remember your details when you login.  This allows you to access your account. Without such cookies such services cannot be provided.
Analytical/Performance Cookies collect anonymous information on how people use the website or app, which helps us develop these. We can see if people find things easily and improve site navigation.
Functionality Cookies remember you when you return to the site or app and choices you have made on previous visits, such as searches and which country you’re from.  This allows us to personalise our content for you, such as enabling us to remember your preferences.
What are similar technologies?
Tagging works in a similar way to cookies.  We use a tag called a pixel.  A pixel is an image that once imbedded in an email connects to a file stored on our web server and allows us to determine customer interest in our marketing emails.  Tags can also be known as beacons.
These allow us to see which promotions seem of interest to our customers, and if a particular offer seems to interest you.  We may use this information to send offers which appear to be more relevant to you.

Modern Slavery statement
This statement, made in accordance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the policies adopted and steps taken by Vue International to:
assess the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our business or supply chain;
prevent any instances of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our own business;and
ensure that every supplier with whom we do business is taking appropriate steps to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking does not occur within their business (or their own supply chain).
In this statement, the terms “Vue International” and the “Group” refer, respectively, to Vue International Holdings Limited and all of its subsidiaries
.
Our business, structure and supply chain
Vue International is one of the world's leading cinema operators, managing a number of the most respected brands in major European markets, spanning eight countries, 224 sites and 1,962 screens. The Group has leading positions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and Lithuania.
Each of the Group’s brands is operated as a separate business unit, with local management in each jurisdiction reporting to the Group head office located in London
The Group’s suppliers include film and other screen content distributors, as well as manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of food, beverages, merchandise, uniforms, technical equipment and providers of cleaning and facilities management services, property maintenance and construction services and other professional services.
Group policy statement
Vue International does not tolerate modern slavery or human trafficking in any aspect of its business, and holds each of its suppliers to the same zero-tolerance standard (regardless of the nature, scale or jurisdiction of their business).
Supplier diligence
Before entering into a relationship with any new supplier, Vue International assesses the modern slavery risks associated with that supplier, the goods or services with respect to which Vue International is proposing to contract with that supplier, and the geographical areas in which that supplier operates. The outcome of this initial analysis determines the level of due diligence which Vue International conducts with respect to that supplier and in relation to those goods or services. In all cases, Vue International will take all reasonable steps:
to confirm that no instance of modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within that supplier’s business;
to confirm the steps that the supplier has taken to ensure that no modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within their own business or supply chain; and
to obtain such further information or evidence from that supplier or other sources as the Group may deem necessary or appropriate regarding that supplier’s policies and processes in relation to modern slavery or human trafficking.
Vue International’s approach to supplier diligence is informed by the Group’s zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking. If the Group is not able to satisfy itself as to the modern slavery and human trafficking policies or procedures of a potential supplier or the modern slavery risks associated with that supplier and its operations, the Group will not conduct any business with that supplier.
While Vue International places significant emphasis on diligence at the point of potential engagement, it also keeps itself appraised of its supply chains as required. Were the Group to discover any evidence, or have cause for suspicion, that any instance of modern slavery or human trafficking had occurred with any of its suppliers, the Group would immediately cease to do business with that supplier pending a full investigation and if appropriate would report the matter to the relevant legal authorities.
Additionally, the Group will always seek to ensure that any supplier contract contains an obligation on the supplier to comply with applicable modern slavery and human trafficking prevention laws and regulations, and to maintain appropriate and robust policies and procedures in that regard.
Supply chain risk analysis
Generally, Vue International considers the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within its or its businesses’ supply chain to be low. The principal reasons for this are that:
the Group’s key suppliers are large international organisations with robust and sophisticated prevention and compliance policies (overseen by professional compliance teams) in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking; and
many of the Group’s suppliers operate in industries which receive a relatively high degree of independent regulatory scrutiny (for example, its suppliers in the food and beverage supply and manufacturing industry).
If the Group identifies a supplier (or potential supplier) with higher risk characteristics in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking, they will be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny as part of the procurement process. Characteristics indicating a need for such enhanced scrutiny may include:
the operation of manufacturing or processing facilities by a supplier in countries with less developed protections against worker exploitation, or with higher levels of estimated modern slavery (as determined by the Global Slavery Index 2023); or
a supplier’s reliance on supply chains with considerable geographic or operational complexity, resulting in challenges for consistent application and monitoring of relevant policies.
The Group also recognises the fact that over the last few years, global supply chains have continued to feel the strain of economic and political instability, international conflict, inflationary pressures and rising raw material prices. These factors put suppliers under pressure which, in turn, increases the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. The Group takes account of that increased risk during its analysis of the materials provided by potential suppliers as part of the diligence process.
Effectiveness of the policies and strategies
At no time since its formation has Vue International encountered, or been the subject of any allegations or complaints of, any occurrence of modern slavery or human trafficking within its business or supply chain.
Whilst this is encouraging, Vue International acknowledges that the Group has a continuing obligation to ensure that its relevant policies and strategies remain fit for purpose as the scale of its business and operations develop over time.
Employee awareness and training
Vue International has adopted a Whistle-Blowing Policy, details of which are available to all employees. This Policy promotes accountability and encourages employees to report concerns about any potential issue affecting the Group, including actual or suspected occurrences of modern slavery or human trafficking. The Policy sets out how employees can raise their concerns, including through the confidential whistle-blowing hotline.
The Group’s Code of Conduct encourages all employees to raise any concerns or queries they may have in relation to potential misconduct of any kind. The Group continues to consider further ways in which it can increase its employees’ awareness of the specific role they have in preventing slavery and human trafficking, and in helping the Group and its individual businesses to implement policies and processes in that regard.
Continuing development
The Group and its businesses strive to improve and update their policies to reflect the most recent standards of best practice including the policies and processes intended to reduce the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking.
Vue International’s key initiatives include the following:
standardising the supplier due diligence criteria and process record keeping across all businesses and functions within the Group;
implementing a recurring programme of training and awareness in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking; and
increasing the quality and visibility of the modern slavery and human trafficking information available on the intranet sites for the Group’s businesses.
