Why a Privacy Policy is important
If you have a website, app, ecommerce store or Saas app, chances are you need a Privacy Policy. Get caught without one and you risk some hefty fines. But where do you start? If you're not a lawyer, it can feel like you're drowning in legal jargon and technical nonsense. That's where we come in.
Privacy Policies with global coverage
Almost every country in the world has some kind of privacy law to protect their citizens' personal information. That's why every Privacy Policy we generate is adapted to comply with the major privacy laws relevant to you. Just tell us where you operate and we'll customise your Privacy Policy accordingly.
CPRA, CCPA & CalOPPA
CPRA, CCPA & CalOPPA protect personal data belonging to residents of California. If you collect personal information online in the U.S, we'll make sure your Privacy Policy complies with CPRA, CCPA & CalOPPA laws.
GDPR
GDPR controls data privacy in the EU. If your business operates within an EU member state or collects personal data from EU citizens, we'll generate a Privacy Policy that includes the necessary GDPR wording.
The rest of the world
Our Privacy Policies are adapted to be a fit with major privacy laws around the world to keep your business safe.
