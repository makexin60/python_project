Targeting or    Advertising cookies
From time-to-time, we may engage third    parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from    individuals who visit our Site. We sometimes use cookies delivered by third    parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these    cookies remember which browsers have visited our Site. By way of example, as    you browse our Site, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so    that we can understand what you are interested in.

We also contract with third-party advertising networks and similar partners    that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below)    on our Site, from emails, and on third-party sites.

8. Personal  Data Transferred Internationally.
If you use  the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that personal  information may be collected, stored, and processed in the United States and  Canada. If we transfer personal information internationally, we take steps to  provide adequate safeguards, such as entering into standard contractual clauses  with our service providers.  Please be aware  that the data protection laws of the United States might not be as  comprehensive as those in your country.
9. Data  Security.
The security  of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry  standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission  and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet,  or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

Children  under the age of 13 should not use our websites or games at any time. In the  event that we confirm that we have inadvertently gathered personal information  from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly  remove such information from our records. We do not knowingly collect or store  any Personal Data from children under 13. If parents believe that we have  unintentionally collected their children’s’ Personal Data, they may request the  deletion of the information by contacting us at:
uCool, Inc.  Attn: Legal - Privacy 585 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 3, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA
They may  also e-mail us at legal@ucool.com.
10.2. Note  to Parents.
We recognize  a special obligation to protect Personal Data about young children. We urge  parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,  addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers under  the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review  this Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out  policy or to raise any concerns.
11. How We  Respond to Do Not Track Signals.
uCool does  not track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide  targeted advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take any  action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other  mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the  collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer's online activities  over time and across third-party web sites or online services.
12. Your  California Privacy Rights.
This section  applies to our collection and use of “Personal Information”, as defined under  California law, if you are a resident of California.
Categories of Personal Information  Collected, Used, and Disclosed
“Personal  Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is  reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked,  directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. In accordance  with California law, we collected the following categories of Personal  Information within the preceding 12 months:
Identifiers such as your name, alias, email       address, mailing address, IP address, and online identifiers;
Certain categories of Personal Information       described in subdivision (e) of California Civil Code Section 1798.80;
Internet or other electronic network activity       information, including information on your usage of our Website (“
Usage       Information
”);
Information used to create a profile about a       consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or behavior; and
Commercial information, including records of       products or services purchased or other purchasing histories.
We disclose  each of these categories of Personal Information to our service providers to  the extent necessary for them to facilitate our business purposes (including  any purpose specified in Section 4, above).   Additionally, within the past 12 months, some of our online advertisers  may have used and disclosed Usage Information collected automatically from the  Service. This may be a “sale” as broadly defined under the CCPA.  Therefore, we provide you the right to opt  out of this “sale” of Personal Information as described, below.
Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a  resident of the state of California, you have the following rights:
Right to Know
. You may have the right to request information       on the categories of personal information that we collected in the       previous twelve (12) months, the categories of sources from which the       Personal Information was collected, the specific pieces of Personal       Information we have collected about you, and the business purposes for       which such personal information is collected and shared. You also have the       right to request information on the categories of Personal Information       which were disclosed for business purposes, and the categories of third parties       in the twelve (12) months preceding your request for your personal       information.
Right to Delete.
You may       have a right to request us to delete Personal Information that we       collected from you.
Right to Opt-Out.
You have a right to opt-out of certain       disclosures of Personal Information to third parties, if such disclosures       constitute a “sale” under California law.        As noted above, in the past twelve (12) months we enabled       advertisers to collect certain information from the Site, which the       advertisers may use to improve their interest-based advertising       networks.  Regardless of whether       this is a “sale,” you may opt-out of interest-based advertising as       described in Section 3.3, above.
If you would  like to exercise your rights listed above, please contact (or have your  authorized agent contact) us using the contact information listed below.  When doing so, please tell us which right you  are exercising and provide us with contact information to direct our response.  We must verify your identity before fulfilling  your requests.  If we cannot initially  verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the  verification process. Any Personal Information you disclose to us for purposes  of verifying your identity will solely be used for the purpose of  verification.  You have a right not to  receive discriminatory treatment by any business when you exercise your  California privacy rights.
Additionally,  if you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits  you to request information regarding the disclosure of Personal Data about you  by uCool to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

From time-to-time, we may engage third    parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from    individuals who visit our Site. We sometimes use cookies delivered by third    parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these    cookies remember which browsers have visited our Site. By way of example, as    you browse our Site, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so    that we can understand what you are interested in.

8. Personal  Data Transferred Internationally.
If you use  the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that personal  information may be collected, stored, and processed in the United States and  Canada. If we transfer personal information internationally, we take steps to  provide adequate safeguards, such as entering into standard contractual clauses  with our service providers.  Please be aware  that the data protection laws of the United States might not be as  comprehensive as those in your country.
9. Data  Security.
The security  of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry  standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission  and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet,  or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to  use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee  its absolute security.

Children  under the age of 13 should not use our websites or games at any time. In the  event that we confirm that we have inadvertently gathered personal information  from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly  remove such information from our records. We do not knowingly collect or store  any Personal Data from children under 13. If parents believe that we have  unintentionally collected their children’s’ Personal Data, they may request the  deletion of the information by contacting us at:
uCool, Inc.  Attn: Legal - Privacy 585 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 3, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA
They may  also e-mail us at legal@ucool.com.
10.2. Note  to Parents.
We recognize  a special obligation to protect Personal Data about young children. We urge  parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,  addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers under  the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review  this Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out  policy or to raise any concerns.
11. How We  Respond to Do Not Track Signals.
uCool does  not track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide  targeted advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take any  action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other  mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the  collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer's online activities  over time and across third-party web sites or online services.
12. Your  California Privacy Rights.
This section  applies to our collection and use of “Personal Information”, as defined under  California law, if you are a resident of California.
Categories of Personal Information  Collected, Used, and Disclosed
“Personal  Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is  reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked,  directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. In accordance  with California law, we collected the following categories of Personal  Information within the preceding 12 months:
Identifiers such as your name, alias, email       address, mailing address, IP address, and online identifiers;
Certain categories of Personal Information       described in subdivision (e) of California Civil Code Section 1798.80;
Internet or other electronic network activity       information, including information on your usage of our Website (“
Usage       Information
”);
Information used to create a profile about a       consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or behavior; and
Commercial information, including records of       products or services purchased or other purchasing histories.
We disclose  each of these categories of Personal Information to our service providers to  the extent necessary for them to facilitate our business purposes (including  any purpose specified in Section 4, above).   Additionally, within the past 12 months, some of our online advertisers  may have used and disclosed Usage Information collected automatically from the  Service. This may be a “sale” as broadly defined under the CCPA.  Therefore, we provide you the right to opt  out of this “sale” of Personal Information as described, below.
Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a  resident of the state of California, you have the following rights:
Right to Know
. You may have the right to request information       on the categories of personal information that we collected in the       previous twelve (12) months, the categories of sources from which the       Personal Information was collected, the specific pieces of Personal       Information we have collected about you, and the business purposes for       which such personal information is collected and shared. You also have the       right to request information on the categories of Personal Information       which were disclosed for business purposes, and the categories of third parties       in the twelve (12) months preceding your request for your personal       information.
Right to Delete.
You may       have a right to request us to delete Personal Information that we       collected from you.
Right to Opt-Out.
You have a right to opt-out of certain       disclosures of Personal Information to third parties, if such disclosures       constitute a “sale” under California law.        As noted above, in the past twelve (12) months we enabled       advertisers to collect certain information from the Site, which the       advertisers may use to improve their interest-based advertising       networks.  Regardless of whether       this is a “sale,” you may opt-out of interest-based advertising as       described in Section 3.3, above.
If you would  like to exercise your rights listed above, please contact (or have your  authorized agent contact) us using the contact information listed below.  When doing so, please tell us which right you  are exercising and provide us with contact information to direct our response.  We must verify your identity before fulfilling  your requests.  If we cannot initially  verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the  verification process. Any Personal Information you disclose to us for purposes  of verifying your identity will solely be used for the purpose of  verification.  You have a right not to  receive discriminatory treatment by any business when you exercise your  California privacy rights.
Additionally,  if you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits  you to request information regarding the disclosure of Personal Data about you  by uCool to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To  make such a request under this Section, please send an email to legal@ucool.com  or write to us: uCool, Inc. Attn: Legal - Privacy 585 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 3,  Menlo Park, CA 94025

Customers cannot opt out of  receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or our  services. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing  emails, we may still send you a response to any "Contact Us" request  as well as administrative, maintenance and operational emails (for example, in  connection with a password reset request).
8.  Personal Data Transferred Internationally.
If you use the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that  personal information may be collected, stored, and processed in the United  States.

uCool does not track Site users over time and across third party websites to  provide targeted advertising. Accordingly, we do not currently respond or take  any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or  other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice  regarding the collection of Personal Data about an individual consumer's online  activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. uCool’s  service providers or other third parties described in Section 5 may respond  differently to “do not track” signals, as described in their respective privacy  policies.

uCool complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework  and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set  forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and  retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “EU”) member countries and  Switzerland. uCool has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres  to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward  Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and  Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.
