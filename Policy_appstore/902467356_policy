Privacy Rules
At TSL

we have a longstanding commitment to respect the privacy of our consumers, customers and other individuals we deal with, such as suppliers. Being transparent about how we deal with personal data helps to build trust. As we transform into a larger company, complying with our privacy standards is increasingly important to achieve that commitment.
The TSL

Transparency
TSL
