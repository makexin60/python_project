​
At BOTTLE TOP STUDIOS LTD("we," "us," or "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection and use of information in our mobile applications (the "Apps").
Our Commitment to No Data Collection:
We want to assure you that we do not collect any personal data from you
while you use our Apps. This means:
No User Accounts: We do not require or create user accounts.
No Tracking: We do not use any tracking technologies to monitor your activity within or outside our Apps.
No Data Transmission: We do not transmit any data from your device to our servers or any third-party servers.
No Personal Information Requests: We do not ask for any personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, or location.
No Analytics: We do not include any third party analytics SDKs or our own analytics to track user behaviour.
​
Permissions:
Some of our Apps may request certain permissions on your device to function correctly (e.g., access to the camera for a camera-based app, or access to local storage for saving data). These permissions are only used within the App itself and are not used to collect or transmit any data to us.
Third-Party Services:
If our apps use third party frameworks or SDKs for basic functionality, we ensure that those frameworks are used in a way that respects the users privacy.
Advertising: Some of our Apps may display advertisements. If advertisements are displayed, we do not share any personal information with advertisers. The advertisers themselves may collect data, and you should refer to their respective privacy policies for more information. We strive to only use ad networks that are known to be respectful of user privacy.
In-App Purchases: If our Apps offer in-app purchases, those transactions are handled by the app store (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store). We do not collect or store any payment information. Please refer to the app store's privacy policy for information about their data practices.
Links to External Websites: If our Apps contain links to external websites, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website you visit.
​
Children's Privacy:
Our Apps are designed for general audiences and are not specifically targeted towards children under the age of 13. Because we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
​
Changes to This Privacy Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page. Your continued use of our Apps after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
