What information are you sharing with us?
As our customer we receive some of your information at various times in the process. This is necessary for us to process your purchase, give you a working product, or respond to any queries. Here’s exactly what information is shared and what we do with it:
When you buy a device
– at this point you share your payment details with our payment provider, Stripe – we don’t receive this information, we just get the money from Stripe after the transaction. However, we do need your name and address so we can send you your product, and your email address so that we can confirm your purchase.
When you first get the Beeline app
– using the Beeline app requires you to create an account. This is because the product includes features like saving your favourite places and saving your ride history, so the app needs to save that information that’s personalised to you. You can create an app either by using your Facebook account or your email address. If you sign up with Facebook, some details like your name, email address, and profile picture are shared from your Facebook account to our account database. If you sign-up with email, your name, email and password are shared to our account database.
When you’re using the Beeline app
– for the product to work it requires you to share your location information with us so that we can point you in the right direction. We save this location information against your account so that you can go back and see the rides you have done. We also give you the option to save useful places and save favourite routes, and by doing this you place this information within your account in our database. We also collect information on how you use the app, such as how regularly you use it, for how long, and using which functions. We do this so that we know what works well and what doesn’t, so we can continually improve the product and create new, better products.
When you contact us for help
– your queries will be saved in our customer services database. This means when you get in touch with us, we can look at the conversations we’ve had in the past and get make sure we can solve your query to the best of our ability.
What do we share with third parties?
We only share personal information with third parties when it is necessary for delivering or operating our products. For example, we use a third party to deliver the products to you when you order from the website, so for that to happen we share your name and address with our delivery partner so they can deliver to your house. In these cases, we make sure that any providers we need to share any details with have good security practices in place.
The future and further information
As we develop our products further we may use your information in different ways. If this happens, this page will be updated and a full explanation provided of anything new. Remember, our full legal privacy policy can be found

Further information about retention time
Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
Therefore:

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
