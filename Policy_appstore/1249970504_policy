If you do not want Pure Casino Apps to collect, store, use or share the personal data you provide in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you should not play Pure Casino Apps games or use our Service.

If you play Pure Casino Apps games or access our Service on connected third-party applications or connect our Service to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, Pure Casino Apps may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Pure Casino Apps game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.
For example, Pure Casino Apps may collect and store some or all of the following information shared by the third-party application:
your first and last name;
your profile picture or its URL;
your user ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to other information like your name and profile photo, and your friends’ identifiers;
the login e-mail you provided to the third-party application;
If you access our Service from a third-party application or connect our Service to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application’s Terms of Service and Privacy Notice.
If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.

Some messages, like invitations for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional messages (“Promotional Communications”) directly or in partnership with other parties. For more information on how you can opt-out of Promotional Communications, please see the Your Rights section below.
We may use technologies that (a) may be considered automated decision-making or profiling, and/or (b) include artificial intelligence to evaluate personal data that we collect (including, for example, in-game activity and communications within our Service) to improve our Service (for example, to prioritize customer support inquiries to shorten response times, personalize  the game experience, and to understand trends in response to certain features in our Service) and for other legitimate business purposes. We will not use these technologies in a way that has a legally significant impact on you, unless we have your consent, or we are otherwise legally permitted to do so.
We may use personal data for any other purposes communicated to you at the point of collection, or otherwise with your consent.
How We Share Personal Data
We may share personal data about you between and among Naladex Studios SL and its subsidiaries.
Additionally, we may disclose or publish aggregated and analytical information (information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify any individual player, for example, players between the ages of 25 and 30 who live in Chicago) and other non-personal data about our players for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and other business purposes.
In addition, we may share information (which may include personal data) with third parties (in other words, parties other than Pure Casino Apps) or allow third parties to collect this information from our Service as described in this Privacy Notice.
Service Providers
Pure Casino Apps uses its subsidiaries and other unaffiliated companies (“Service Providers”) to support the Service, for example, to assist us with processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing game play and enhancing player experience, e-mail delivery, hosting services, and managing and delivering contextual and tailored advertisements.
Friends and Other Pure Casino Apps Players
In most Pure Casino Apps games, if you play or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends may see your name, profile photo, and details about your gameplay (like your game progression or rewards earned).
If you use our Service in response to an invitation from another player, that player may see certain information about you and your in-game activities, including when you join and the level(s) you reach within the game. Correspondingly, in many Pure Casino Apps games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, may be able to see details about your gameplay (including the identification of any Pure Casino Apps games you have played), communicate with you within our Service, and view your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through a social network and/or Pure Casino Apps communication channels.

performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
aggregated and/or de-identified information about players that is not intended to specifically identify any individual player (For example, players between the ages of 45 and 65 who live in San Francisco);
certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and device identifiers);
your social network ID;
your in-game activity (for example, your level).
The information collected may be used to:
measure how effective ads are;
personalize the player experience by showing advertisements for products and services that may be more likely to appeal to you;
undertake web analytics (like Google Analytics) to analyze traffic and other player activity.
Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.
Please note, after clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Pure Casino Apps, in an application owned by Pure Casino Apps, or on the social network through which you are playing Pure Casino Apps games.
Sale or Merger
In the event that Pure Casino Apps undertakes efforts to engage in a business transition (including but not limited to a merger with and/or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part its assets), we may disclose relevant information we have, including personal data, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts as described in this Privacy Notice to let you know of the business transition before transferring personal data to the extent required by law.
Legal Compliance
We may share personal data in the following circumstances:
when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);

where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions;

Pure Casino Apps may send, access, use, and/or store personal data outside of the country or region where you live including, for example, to the United States and Israel. We may transfer personal data to our subsidiaries, vendors, business partners, and others as described in this Privacy Notice.
Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where personal data is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws in place where you live. When we transfer personal data outside of the location where it was collected, we put into place appropriate safeguards (including, for example, contracts) or otherwise make efforts to ensure that such transfers meet applicable local legal requirements.

When we serve you personalized video ads, we share your resettable identifiers provided by your mobile device’s operating system with ad networks, social media companies and other third-party businesses in the ad ecosystem. The typical resettable advertising IDs are GAID (Android) and IDFA (Apple). Third parties may use your personal information to:
serve relevant ads on our site, on other websites or mobile apps, or on other devices a Player may use;
to personalize content; and
to perform other advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.
In addition, in some instances, third parties may use the information for their own purposes and in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms of use, which may include providing this information to additional third parties, including other advertising networks. Pure Casino Apps provides opportunities, where appropriate, for players to opt-out of the use and sharing of personal data about them for this purpose.
You may reset these identifiers from within your mobile device or limit ad tracking for your mobile device as mentioned above. Alternatively, if you would like to opt out of personalized advertising in our games, please visit the Pure Casino Apps
Contact Page
or you may also do so in the Advanced Settings of our games by changing the personalized/ tailored ads toggle to “off”. If you opt-out, you’ll still see ads, but they’ll most likely be less relevant.

Contact Page
or through the Support page within the game you play. We will respond to your request in consistent with applicable laws and subject to adequate verification. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information necessary to verify your account.
