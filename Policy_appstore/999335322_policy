Penguin is home to the best authors of
fiction
,
non-fiction
and
children's
books.
We make books for everyone, because a book can change anyone.
Some time ago - in 1934, to be precise - our founder was waiting for a train and couldn't find anything good to read. What was needed, he realised, were quality books at a reasonable price. And so he decided to change things - the following year Penguin was launched, kickstarting a paperback revolution that would sweep the world.
