If you actively agree to such in the App or a corresponding query in the settings of your mobile device, Kärcher processes the corresponding data based on your consent (Article 6(1) sentence 1 a) GDPR).
6. Transaction processing via commercetools
To process any transaction, the app uses the services of commercetools GmbH, Adams-Lehmann-Str. 44, 80797 Munich, Germany (‘commercetools’).
When you place an order in our app, Kärcher transfers your name, address, email address and technical user ID to commercetools, which processes these data on our behalf (Article 28 GDPR).
commercetools stores the buyer’s name and address as well as the technical user ID to process the transaction. The buyer’s email address is also stored for the purpose of sending the order confirmation and the receipt. Furthermore, consent to acknowledgment of the Terms and Conditions, the cancellation notice, consent to the waiver of the right of cancellation and the clicking of the button ‘Order and pay’ are stored.
These data are processed in order to process the respective transaction and therefore to execute the contract pursuant to point b) of Article 6 (1) sentence 1 GDPR.
commercetools stores the data for a period of 12 months for successfully processed payments. Cancelled payments shall be erased after 7 days.
7. Recipients of the data
We exchange personal data within the Kärcher Group if and to the extent that such is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures pursuant to point b) of Article 6 (1) GDPR or a legitimate interest arises in an intra-Group transfer in accordance with point f) of Article 6 (1) GDPR.
In addition to the cases explicitly mentioned in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will only be passed on to third parties without your express prior consent if such is legally permissible or required.
If necessary to investigate the illegal or abusive use of the Platform or for legal prosecution, personal data will be forwarded to the law enforcement authorities or other public authorities and, if necessary, to injured third parties. However, this will only happen if there are indications of illegal or abusive conduct. We are also legally obligated to provide information to certain public bodies upon request. These may be criminal prosecution authorities, public authorities that prosecute administrative offences subject to fines, and the financial authorities.
Any transfer of personal data is justified by the fact that (1) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to transfer data to law enforcement authorities to which we are subject in accordance with point c) of Article 6 (1) GDPR in conjunction with national legal requirements, or (2) we have a legitimate interest in passing the data on to the named third parties if there are indications of abusive conduct or to enforce legal claims and your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data within the meaning of point f) of Article 6 (1) GDPR do not prevail.
External companies and external service providers are used to enable us to offer the services on this Platform. Under Article 28 (1) GDPR, any third-party companies and external service providers used as processors are carefully selected, regularly reviewed and contractually obligated to process all personal data exclusively in accordance with our instructions.
8. Newsletter
You can subscribe to the Kärcher email newsletter by ticking the checkbox provided.
Once you have subscribed to our email newsletter, we or the company from the Kärcher Group which is responsible for you on the basis of your registered office will regularly send you information regarding our promotions, offers and services. We use the double opt-in procedure to send the newsletter. This means that we will only send you an email newsletter once you have expressly given your consent to receive it. We will then send you a confirmation email in which you will be requested to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter in future by clicking on a corresponding link.
If you subscribe to the newsletter in the App by ticking the newsletter checkbox in the App or if you have already subscribed to the newsletter in the past, your stored profile information and the devices stored in the App will be added to your existing newsletter profile or used as the basis for creating a new newsletter profile. This information is used to personalise newsletters in order to provide you with the most suitable information on our promotions, offers and services. When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store your IP address as provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of subscription in order to trace any potential abuse of your email address at a later point in time. We also store the date and time upon which the confirmation link was clicked in the confirmation mail which is sent for control purposes (double opt-in procedure), and the IP address provided by the Internet service provider (ISP).
For the purpose of analysis, the emails sent with Adobe Campaign contain a so-called ’tracking pixel’ which connects with the Adobe Campaign servers when the email is opened. In this way, it is possible to assess whether a newsletter message has been opened.
This data is processed on the basis of your consent as per Art. 6 (1) a GDPR or based on justified interests on our part as per Art. 6 (1) f GDPR as proof of the necessary consent or needs-based design of the newsletter.
You can revoke your consent and unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time.
The data you provide us with in order to receive the newsletter and which we store to demonstrate your consent are stored until you are removed from the newsletter mailing list and then erased once you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Your email address and all the personal data listed here are erased from our newsletter mailing list once you have unsubscribed, unless you have expressly consented to the further use of your data or if we reserve the right to use your data beyond this scope in a manner which is permitted by law and about which we have informed you in this declaration.
9. Contact option
If you contact us using the developer’s email address in the app store, we may send you a Google form to classify your query and then forward it to the Kärcher sales company responsible for you.
10. Use of cookies
Cookies are stored on your end device when you use the App. Cookies are small text files stored on your end device which provide Kärcher with certain information. Cookies cannot execute programs or transmit viruses to your computer. Their purpose is to make the App more user-friendly and effective. Currently only the required cookies are used to recognise the user based on a previous login. You can erase cookies from your end device by default after using the App.
11. Local storage
Kärcher uses local storage technology for temporary local storage of information from your smart device. Local storage uses the storage capacity of your web browser. In other words, data is stored in your web browser. This data is stored on your browser for an unlimited period of time and updated each time you connect to the Kärcher Cloud. You can use your browser settings to check which data is stored in your browser's local storage and also clear the local storage.
12. Kärcher Cloud
The Kärcher Cloud stores the data at a storage location of Amazon Ireland, Burlington Plaza, Burlington Rd, Saint Peter's, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Data is stored and processed on servers of Amazon Web Services in the European Union. For this purpose, Kärcher has concluded a commissioned data processing agreement with Amazon with standard contractual clauses.
13. Storage duration
Erasure of your registration data
Upon termination of the contractual relationship, the data held at Kärcher is erased provided that this does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations. This will happen if you erase your account or if the product is removed from your account.
Erasure of App and Device Data
The data generated by the device will be available to you for a maximum period of 90 days and will then be pseudonymised by Kärcher. If you erase your account, the pseudonym assigned to the usage data will be erased by Kärcher.
14. Integration of third-party services
Firebase
The App uses the Google Firebase technology of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (’Firebase’).
Firebase generally uses servers located in the European Economic Area for its services. If data are transferred to the USA, Kärcher has concluded a commissioned data processing agreement with Google with standard contractual clauses for this purpose, in which Google is required to process users’ data only in accordance with our instructions and to comply with the European level of data protection.
The legal basis for use of this cloud service is a legitimate interest according to Article 6 (1) f GDPR in the analysis, optimisation and user-friendly design of the Kärcher Home & Garden App.

https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms
https://firebase.google.com/terms/
https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/
The App uses the following Firebase services:
Google Analytics for Firebase makes it possible to analyse the use of the Kärcher Home & Garden App. It enables information on the use of the App to be recorded, transferred to Google and stored there. Google uses the advertising ID of the end device in this regard. The above information is used to evaluate the use of the App anonymously. In the device settings, use of the advertising ID can be restricted (iOS: Privacy/Advertising/ Limit Ad Tracking; Android: Account/ Google/ Ads).
Firebase Crashlytics is used for stability and improvement of the Kärcher Home & Garden App. Here, information is gathered on the end device used and on the use of the App. This includes, for example, the times when the App is started and when a crash occurs. This information enables Kärcher to diagnose and solve problems.
Kärcher accepts no responsibility for the proper processing of data by Google, Apple or any other App store provider. Please refer to the data privacy statements of these providers. There is no further exchange of data with these companies.
15. Your rights, questions and information
You have the right to information as to whether and which personal data concerning you we store, to rectification or erasure, or to restrict the processing of your data, to object to the processing, and the right to data portability. As your personal data is processed for the performance of a contract, you can no longer use the services provided under the contract once you have objected to the processing of your personal data.
Objection (market research/direct advertising). You can object to the processing of your data for market research or for the purposes of direct advertising at any time. For this purpose, please send an email to datenschutzbeauftragter@de.kaercher.com. Once you have objected, the personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes.
The consent given by you to Kärcher for the use of your personal data, for example, to send the Kärcher newsletter, can be withdrawn at any time. If you wish to revoke your consent to receive the newsletter, please click on the 'unsubscribe from newsletter' link at the bottom of any of the newsletter emails received. In all other cases, please contact the data protection officer.
If you have any further questions regarding the processing of your data or if you would like information regarding the data concerning you that is stored in the Kärcher Cloud, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at the address provided above or by emailing datenschutzbeauftragter@de.kaercher.com.
16. Competent supervisory authority
As the data subject, you have the right — without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy — to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you believe that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes data protection regulations.

Data protection
Firebase support for GDPR and CCPA
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the
1995 EU Data Protection Directive. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy
Rights Act (CPRA), which is a data privacy law that amends and expands upon the
CCPA, took effect. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under
these privacy regulations, whether they are large software companies or
independent developers.
The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors, and the
CCPA/CPRA imposes obligations on businesses and their service providers.
Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" (GDPR) or "business"
(CCPA/CPRA) for any personal data or information about their end-users they
provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google generally
operates as a "data processor" (GDPR) or "service provider" (CCPA/CPRA).
This means that data is under the customer's control. Customers are
responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect
to their personal data or information.
Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms
When customers use Firebase, Google is generally a data processor under GDPR and
processes personal data on their behalf. Similarly, when customers use Firebase,
Google generally operates as a service provider under the CCPA/CPRA handling
personal information on their behalf. Firebase terms include
Data Processing
and Security Terms
detailing these
responsibilities.
Certain Firebase services governed by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms of Service
are already covered by associated data processing terms, the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum
.
A complete list of Firebase services currently governed by the GCP Terms of
Service is available in the
Terms of Service for Firebase Services
.
Google Analytics is a separate service that can be used together with Firebase,
and is subject to separate
terms
.
Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards
ISO and SOC compliance
All Firebase services (aside from App Indexing) have successfully completed the
ISO
27001
and
SOC
1
,
SOC
2
,
and
SOC 3
evaluation
process, and some have also completed the
ISO
27017
and
ISO
27018
certification
process. Compliance reports and certificates for Firebase services governed by
the GCP Terms of Service may be requested via the
Compliance Reports
Manager

International Data Transfers
As described in our
Data Privacy Framework
certification
,
we comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (DPF) and the
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from the
EEA, Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Google LLC (and its wholly-owned US
subsidiaries unless explicitly excluded) has certified that it adheres to the
DPF Principles. Google remains responsible for any of your personal information
that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on our behalf, as described in the
"Sharing your
information" section of our Privacy
Policy
. To learn more about
the DPF, and to view Google's certification, please visit the
DPF
website
.
If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF
certification, we encourage you to
contact
us
. Google is
subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
Commission. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection
authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain
circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in
Annex I to the
DPF
Principles
.
Data processing information
Examples of end-user data processed by Firebase
Some Firebase services process your end users' data to provide their service.
The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle
end-user data that may potentially be identifying. In addition, many Firebase
services offer the ability to request deletion of specific data or control how
data is handled.
Firebase service
End-user data
How data helps provide the service
Cloud Functions for Firebase
IP addresses
How it helps:
Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to
            execute event-handling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.
Retention:
Cloud functions only saves IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase App Check
Attestation material from supported attestation providers
App Check tokens from successful attestations
How it helps:
Firebase App Check uses attestation
            material required by the corresponding attestation provider and
            received from end-user's devices to help establish the integrity of
            the device and/or the app. Attestation materials are sent to the
            corresponding attestation provider for validation based on the
            developer's configuration. App Check tokens obtained from successful
            attestations are sent with every request to supported Firebase
            services to access resources protected by App Check.
Retention:
Attestation material is not retained by
            App Check, but when it is sent to attestation providers, it is
            subject to the terms of those attestation providers. App Check
            tokens returned from successful attestations are valid throughout
            their TTL duration, which cannot be longer than 7 days. For
            developers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the
            App Check tokens used with these features for at most 30 days. Other
            App Check tokens not used with replay protection features are not
            retained by Firebase services.
Firebase App Distribution
Users' names
Email addresses
iOS UDIDs
Secure Android IDs
Firebase
installation IDs
Tester feedback (screenshots and text)
How it helps:
Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute
            app builds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app
            feedback, and associate data with tester devices.
Retention:
Firebase App Distribution retains user information
            until the Firebase customer requests its deletion, after which data is removed from live
            and backup systems within 180 days.
Firebase Authentication
Passwords
Email addresses
Phone numbers
User agents
IP addresses
How it helps:
Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user
            authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent
            strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and
            authentication.
Retention:
Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few
            weeks. It retains other authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates
            deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase Cloud Messaging uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase Crashlytics
Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
Firebase installations ID
Crash traces
Breakpad minidump formatted data
(NDK crashes only)
How it helps:
Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack
            traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to
            project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help
            Firebase customers debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation
            UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash and
            minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored
            while the crash session is being processed and then discarded. The
            Firebase installation ID enables upcoming features that will enhance
            crash reporting and crash management services. Refer to
Examples of stored device information
for more detail on the types of user information gathered.
Retention:
Firebase Crashlytics keeps crash stack traces,
            extracted minidump data, and associated identifiers (including
            Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs) for 90 days before
            starting the process of removing it from live and backup systems.
Note:
Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to
            process NDK crashes.
Firebase Dynamic Links
Device specs (iOS)
IP Addresses (iOS)
How it helps:
Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS to open
            newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.
Retention:
Dynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to
            provide the service.
Firebase Hosting
IP addresses
How it helps:
Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect
            abuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.
Retention:
Hosting retains IP data for a few months.
Firebase In-App Messaging
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Firebase In-App Messaging
uses
Firebase
installation IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs
            until the Firebase customer
            makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup
            systems within 180 days.
Firebase ML
Uploaded Images
installation auth tokens
How it helps:
The Cloud based APIs store uploaded images temporarily,
            to process and return the analysis to you. Stored images are typically deleted within a
            few hours. See the Cloud Vision
Data Usage FAQ
for more
            information.
installation auth tokens
are used by
Firebase ML
for device authentication when interacting with app
            instances, for example, to distribute developer models to app instances.
Retention:
installation auth tokens remain valid until their
            expiration date. The default token lifetime is one week.
Firebase Performance Monitoring
Firebase
installation IDs
IP addresses
How it helps:
Performance Monitoring
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to calculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network resources,
            to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous. It also uses
Firebase
installation IDs with
Firebase Remote Config
to manage the rate of performance event reporting. Additionally, it uses IP
            addresses to map performance events to the countries they originate from. For more
            information, see
Data collection
.
Retention:
Performance Monitoring
keeps IP-associated
            events for 30 days, and it keeps installation-associated and de-identified performance
            data for 60 days before starting the process of removing it from live and backup
            systems.
Firebase Realtime Database
IP addresses
User agents
How it helps:
Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to
            enable the
profiler
            tool
, which helps Firebase customers understand usage trends and platform
            breakdowns.
Retention:
Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent
            information for a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.
Firebase Remote Config
Firebase
installation IDs
How it helps:
Remote Config
uses
Firebase
installation IDs
            to select configuration
            values to return to end-user devices.
Retention:
Firebase retains
Firebase
installation IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the
          ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.
Vertex AI in Firebase
Customer's inputs and outputs data sent and received from the AI model
How it helps:
Vertex AI in Firebase
uses Vertex AI's Generative AI
            API to predict content.
Retention:
During prediction, Google doesn't log Customer Data to
            generate a customer's output or train foundation models. By default, Google caches a
            customer's inputs and outputs for the Gemini models to accelerate responses to
            subsequent prompts from the customer.

Generative
              AI and Data Governance | Generative AI on Vertex AI | Google Cloud

Guides for enabling opt-in for end-user data processing
Services in the table above need some amount of end-user data to function. As a
result, it's not possible to entirely disable data collection while using those
services.
If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a
service, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just
requires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.
Some services, however, start up automatically when included in an app. To give
users a chance to opt-in before using those services, you can choose to disable
auto-initialization for each service, and manually initialize them at run time
instead. To find out how, read the guides below:
Cloud Messaging
:
Prevent Auto-initialization (Android)
or
Prevent Auto-initialization (iOS+)
Crashlytics
:
Enable Opt-in Reporting (iOS+)
or

Data storage and processing locations
Unless a service or feature offers data location selection, Firebase may process
and store your data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. Potential
facility locations vary by service.
US-only services
The
Firebase Authentication
service is run only from US data centers. As a result,
Firebase Authentication
processes data exclusively in the United States.
Global services
The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure.
They could process data at any of the
Google Cloud Platform locations
or
Google data center locations
.
For some services, you can make a specific data location selection, which
restricts processing to that location (for more information, see the
service specific terms
of the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service).
