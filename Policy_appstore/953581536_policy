Smartfrog is challenging the likes of Google’s Nest Labs …
Security cam is just the start. Smartfrog has built the full IoT software, hardware and cloud... to enter new verticals.
One of the “Ten most-funded IoT startups” and one of the “Six startups to watch“
Smartfrog Group (also known as Smartfrog & Canary Holding Inc.) is the original
consumer IoT SaaS pioneer
with
IoT users
in over
180 countries.
The group’s
mission
is to make
modern technologies useful, easy, affordable
and
safe
for everyone. Initially in 2015, Smartfrog launched the
world’s first 100% consumer IoT SaaS product,
offering an easy to use and affordable
DIY Smart Home security subscription
service starting at $7/month including a free device. In 2018, Smartfrog
expanded to the US
and
acquired Canary Connect.
The two businesses were then merged and are
headquartered in NYC.
The group’s
full-stack platform
and value chain is
end-to-end controlled
and protected by over
100 patents.
The platform
enables data-driven businesses,
offering
SaaS solutions across product areas, supporting people
from
infancy
to
seniority,
accompanying them
through their whole life.
Starting with
Smart Home Security,
the business is gradually
scaling
to new verticals such as
Smart Locks & Access, Last Mile In-Home Delivery, Baby & Child Care, Pet Care, Elder-
and
Healthcare.
The group
grows
both
organically
and through
mergers and acquisitions.
Most recently the Group
expanded
its
portfolio
to include smart locks and access vertical by acquiring Gate Labs and Glue AB.
Leveraging
on the
technologies
and the
teams
acquired, Smartfrog Group is
disrupting the home delivery market
by enabling the
most convenient, secure
and
sustainable
home
access & last-mile delivery
service for the betterment of people, partners and the planet. The Smartfrog Group’s
in-home delivery platform
facilitates quick and secure
delivery of goods
(parcels, groceries, flowers, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and
services
(dry cleaning, home cleaning, handyman, facility manager, etc.) to homes. The system also enables customers to give their friends, family members and guests easy access. The service
works with any lock
and
fully hardware independent
powered by Group’s
AnyLock Technology™.
The access is provided via app, SSL encrypted one-time keys and is fully insured. The Group’s
patented technology
enables the instant transmission of
recorded delivery-video
