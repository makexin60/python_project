Customer Feedback
Magalie B, French
Aurora Village and Visit Murmansk organises day tours. We took one to Teriberka which I strongly recommend as well. Indeed, we ended up on the north-western coast of Russia on the shores of the Barents sea which was a total escape for foreigners like us ! We saw the wide and wild tundra, the one you read about in adventure novels when you are young, magnificent lakes and, of course, the old fishermen's village called Teriberka. Further away on the other side of the village, we took some pics at the ghostly but very photogenic ship cemetery : a great place for your instagram account ;-) and then, we went to Dragon eggs beach (wow !THAT is a spot !) And to a wild waterfall. 
I'd like to thank Oleg and his staff for making our week at Aurora village a great time. We were stuck in Russia because of covid 19 and couldn't see our family in France which we haven't seen for a year so we really appreciated their warm welcome, their disponibility and efficiency.

"…Next we headed out to a place that was meant for winter activities. We played with some huskies, rode snowmobiles and even did a bit of ice fishing. No! We didn’t catch anything other than a cold. It’s funny how the cold creeps up when you stand in one place for two long! That being said I must admit that we had a lot of fun. We made some great friends and learned about a new culture. We were lucky to have found a group that suited our wavelength. Half the fun of an excursion always lies with the company you have.

"Thanks to all of your team for being very good guide, Alex, Ivan, Riga, …. I was very happy to see Aurora even only first night on 18 Feb and Ivan taken a photo for me with his good camera after knowing I had only mobile phone. Please remind Ivan kindly send me the Aurora photos.God bless you, Korakot"

"The management of the travel company “Proco Air Service Inc.”, Tokyo, expresses its sincere gratitude for organizing an advertising tour to the city of Murmansk in the period from 23 to 26 February 2018.Thanks to your high professionalism and exceptional goodwill in communication, harmonious and organized work of the whole team of operators and guides, the tour was held at the highest level!For tourist agencies in Japan, selling winter tours around Russia is extremely difficult, almost impossible. But, after a successful tour thanks to you, taking advantage of all the invaluable knowledge gained, we, for our part, will do our best and will do everything we can to attract Japanese tourists to a new, not yet covered direction, such as the Murmansk region."

"During our hunting North Light tour, Mr. Oleg brought us across the river to take in the nice night of Murmansk city. Then, he drove us to his secret aurora spot where we prayed fervently for a glimpse of the Northern Lights. Mr. Oleg even prepared hot tea while we waited, and a bottle of (rum?) to celebrate the sighting. Weather was not the best when we were on our hunt. Fortunately we managed to locate a window of clear sky and later, witnessed a spectacular dance of the spirits from a distance."
Mr. Sage
