Accordingly, Electronic Team prepared this statement to best inform You of the privacy principles that govern the Website and Services. Electronic Team will not sell or rent Your personally identifiable information or a list of its customers and/or users to third parties. However, as described in more detail below, there are limited circumstances in which some of Your information may be shared with third parties—under strict restrictions—so it is important for You to carefully review this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details about the steps Electronic Team takes to respect Your privacy. Electronic Team has organized this Privacy Policy by major processes and areas so that You can quickly find  the information of most interest to You. The bottom line is that meeting Your needs and expectations forms the foundation of everything Electronic Team does, including the protection of Your privacy.
C. INFORMATION ELECTRONIC TEAM COLLECTS
Information Electronic Team Collects Through the Website
The Website does not collect personally identifiable information from Your computer when You browse the Website and request pages from Electronic Team servers. This means that, unless You voluntarily and knowingly provide Electronic Team with personally identifiable information, Electronic Team will not know Your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.
When You request a page from the Electronic Team Website, Electronic Team’s servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP address, the time of the request, the URL of the request, and other technical information. Electronic Team collects this information in order to make its Website function correctly and to provide You the functionality that You see on the Website, as Electronic Team’s servers use this information to deliver the internet pages You request. Electronic Team also uses this information to better understand how visitors use the Website and how Electronic Team can better tune its Website, contents, and functionality to best meet Your needs. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.
When You use the Website, Electronic Team, or trusted authorized third parties, may also collect certain technical and routing information about Your computer (also known as environmental variables) to facilitate Your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby. When You browse the Internet, Your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to Electronic Team every time You access content on one of Electronic Team’s internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular web page You visited, the IP address of the computer You are using, or the browser version that You are using to access the Website. All of this information may be collected by Electronic Team and used to help improve its offerings to You.
User Content
User Account holders may be permitted to upload certain content onto the Website and Services (“
User Content
”). This information shall be private and, except in accordance with this Privacy Policy, will not be disclosed to third parties without Your prior permission.
Providing Your Information to Electronic Team
You never have to provide personally identifiable information to Electronic Team. However, should You choose to withhold certain required information, Electronic Team may not be able to provide You with some or all of the Services. Some of the information Electronic Team asks You to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional. If You do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, You may not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. Electronic Team will inform You of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information.
Electronic Team is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website and Services. Electronic Team will only share Your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to comply with a legal process served on Electronic Team, or to otherwise comply with any current or future laws and regulations applicable to Electronic Team.
You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to allow Electronic Team to contact You from time to time regarding Electronic Team news and product or Services updates. In order to do so, You may be required to provide certain personally identifiable information to Electronic Team.

When You submit personal information to Electronic Team through the Website, You understand and
AGREE
that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Electronic Team and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of Your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Electronic Team. Electronic Team may use vendors to aid in the facilitation of technical support services that may potentially receive limited access to Your personal information.
Electronic Team may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to You from the Website or from other websites linked therewith. Typically, these providers would offer services that Electronic Team customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website or Services. In order to use these other-website services, You may be required to provide personal information to such services providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that You provide while You are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such website; however, personal information that You provide while on the Electronic Team Website in conjunction with a provider’s service will be subject to Electronic Team’s Privacy Policy. For instance, credit card information entered in populating a purchase form or registration process is collected by the third-party registration services and subject to their respective privacy policies. You should be aware that Electronic Team’s agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Electronic Team personal information collected from You. In such instances, Electronic Team may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Applications
Electronic Team may make third party applications available to You through the Website or Services. The information collected by Electronic Team when You enable a third-party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third-party application provider is governed by the provider’s privacy policy(ies).
Information Relating to Children (COPPA)
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website
. The Electronic Team Website and any Software or Services available thereon are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, Electronic Team recognizes that children under the age of 13 may potentially access the Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase Software and Services, or download software programs. Parents and Legal Guardians may request Electronic Team to review, delete or stop the collection of any personally identifiable information of their child(ren). You may do so by contacting Electronic Team by email at
ping@electronic.us
.
Cookies and Web Beacons
The Website uses “cookie” and “web beacon” technology. “Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer. Certain pages on Electronic Team’s Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information You enter on multiple pages together. Cookies also enable Electronic Team to customize the Website and offerings to Your needs and provide You with a better online experience with Electronic Team. In addition, cookies are used to:
Measure usage of various pages on Electronic Team’s Website to help make Electronic Team’s information more pertinent to Your needs and easier for You to access;
Identify and categorize the internet webpages from which a visitor came to the Website and in order to observe browsing patterns; and
Provide functionality such as online orders, Electronic Team Services, and other functionalities that Electronic Team believes would be of interest and value to You.
The types of cookies that Electronic Team uses are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once You leave the Website. Persistent cookies remain on Your computer hard drive until You delete them. Electronic Team does not use cookies to gather information concerning Your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about You apart from what You voluntarily provide in your dealings with Electronic Team. Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage Your computer, programs, or computer files.
In addition, the service providers Electronic Team uses to serve and host its advertisements may use session or persistent cookies to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the Website was accessed via an advertisement. There are no automatically-placed cookies within these advertisements, a cookie is placed on Your computer only if and when You click on an advertisement. The cookie generated from the advertisement does not contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on Your hard drive until You delete it. Furthermore, Electronic Team may use email tracking services in order to receive read receipts and related information when sending emails, however, these services are used by Electronic Team for these reasons and not to collect any personal information about You.
You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for Your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect Your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on Electronic Team’s Website.
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1-pixel) that is placed on a website. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The use of web beacons allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited on a website. Electronic Team uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. Electronic Team may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from its third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.
Targeting Cookies
Unless You are a Qualified Individual (as defined in
Section F
, below), Electronic Team
uses targeting cookies to record Your Website visits, the pages You viewed and the hyperlinks You followed. Electronic Team may use this information and share it with third parties to make the Website and advertising more relevant to You.
Electronic Team’s trusted partners, such as Google, help Electronic Team to place advertisements on and off the Website, and perform analytics. Please read Electronic Team’s trusted partners’ privacy and cookies policies below:
Facebook Privacy Policy
Types of Cookies used by Facebook
Facebook Ads
Google Privacy Policy
Types of Cookies used by Google
Google Ads (AdSense and AdWords)
CJ Affiliate Privacy Policy
StackCommerce Privacy Policy
Electronic Team uses Google Analytics to analyze Website usage, with a performance cookie, which collects standard internet log and visitor information in an anonymized form. The information collected is transmitted to Google and then used to compile aggregate information on Website use. Electronic Team also uses Google Ads to oversee online advertisements and to determine with which advertisements users most frequently click and respond. These cookies remain on Your device even after You have logged out or quit a session. To opt out of being tracked by Google Ads visit
Google Ads Help
.
Electronic Team may partner with third-party advertisers to provide information about its goods and services that may be of interest to You. These third-party advertisers may use cookies alone and/or web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about You when You use the Website. They may collect information about Your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide You with relevant advertising or other targeted content. These advertising partners do not have access to or use of Your name, address, email address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information from Electronic Team, without Your
CONSENT
. However, said advertising partners may use persistent identifiers to anonymously track Your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Website. While Electronic Team restricts these partners further use of such information, these third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify You, unknown to Electronic Team. Electronic Team may add or change the list of trusted ad partners from time to time and Electronic Team encourages You to regularly check this Section for changes. To learn more about how online advertising works visit and read the article “
Understanding Online Advertising
.”
D. PURPOSE OF PROCESSING & USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
How Your Personal Information is Used
Electronic Team collects information from You in order to record and support Your participation in the activities provided by Electronic Team. Electronic Team may use Your email address to send a confirmation email when You sign up for a User Account and, if necessary, may use other information You provide to contact You for help to process or provide a purchase or Service You have selected. Your personal information also may be used to keep You informed about new services, service upgrades, special offers, and other Services.
As described above, Electronic Team may collect information about Your use of the Website and Services. This information is collected in aggregate form and usually sent in JavaScript snippets, without explicitly identifying any particular user. Electronic Team may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
Electronic Team recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Website. Without Your
CONSENT
, Electronic Team will not communicate any information to You regarding the Website, Services, or special offers available from Electronic Team or its affiliates, although Electronic Team may find it necessary to communicate with You regarding Your use of the Website, or Services in certain limited circumstances. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Electronic Team will not provide Your name to other companies or organizations without Your
CONSENT
.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
Although Electronic Team will always strive to guard Your identity, Electronic Team may disclose Your personally identifiable information without Your permission in limited circumstances. Electronic Team will only do so if it has a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to its guests, visitors, associates, or property (including the Website or Services), or to others. If Electronic Team is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Your personally identifiable information, Electronic Team will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation. Electronic Team may also disclose Your information to investigate violation of and enforce its Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Please know that Electronic Team does not take this responsibility lightly. Your privacy is of paramount importance to Electronic Team.
Electronic Team may use the services of third parties, such as email service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Electronic Team. These parties are prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Electronic Team specifies. Electronic Team does provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to Electronic Team. Electronic Team prohibits the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Electronic Team’s affiliates for their use without Your approval.
Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
Electronic Team operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Electronic Team security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by Electronic Team users. Electronic Team takes steps to ensure that Your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while Electronic Team strives to protect Your personal information, it cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit to Electronic Team or from the Website or Services. Your use of the Website and Services is at Your own risk.
Electronic Team treats the information You provide to Electronic Team as confidential information; which is, accordingly, subject to Electronic Team’s company security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Electronic Team it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access outside of Electronic Team. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, Electronic Team offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Electronic Team and its service providers conduct business. All Electronic Team employees are aware of Electronic Team privacy and security policies and are required by Electronic Team to abide by these policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
Change of Control
In the event that all or substantially all of Electronic Team’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Electronic Team may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, Your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, You will be given notice as to such changes and the opportunity to re-consent or object to such material changes.
E. DATA CHOICES AVAILABLE TO YOU
Opt-In and Disclosure
You may always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent You from using the Website and having limited access to the Website and Services. Please note, however, if You should choose to withhold certain requested information, Electronic Team may not be able to provide You with some or all of the Services dependent upon the collection of this information. You will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and select Your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for Electronic Team rendering of Services.
Opt-Out Options
You can choose at any time to opt-out of receiving emails from Electronic Team by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email You receive from Electronic Team or by contacting Electronic Team directly at
ping@electronic.us
. If You elect to opt-out, Electronic Team will not, as applicable, share Your personal information with third parties or send You emails. However, Electronic Team may continue to use Your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance Your user experience or as necessary to administer the Website or comply with applicable law.
Registration Email and Contact by Electronic Team
Electronic Team reserves the right to send a one-time registration or payment confirmation email, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service that they have previously signed up for, purchased, or used, regardless of email contact opt-in status. Electronic Team also reserves the right to contact You if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty, or purchase agreements. Electronic Team is retaining this right because in limited cases Electronic Team feels that it may need to contact You as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to You. This does not allow Electronic Team to contact You to market a new or existing service if You have asked Electronic Team not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.
User Account Preferences
When You create a User Account with Electronic Team and/or provide Your email address and other personal identification information, subject to Your personal preferences, You
CONSENT
to allowing Electronic Team to periodically contact You via email and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to You. These communications will relate to Electronic Team offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Electronic Team has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that Electronic Team believes would be of interest to You. Electronic Team may use a third-party email service provider to send emails to You. This service provider is prohibited from using Your email address for any purpose other than to send Electronic Team-related email. If You do not wish to receive emails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending an email to
ping@electronic.us
. In addition, every time You receive an email, You will be provided the choice to opt-out of future emails by following the “unsubscribed” (or similar) instructions provided in the email. You may also opt-out online by updating Your User Account as described under the subheading “User Account” in
Section C
, above.
To ensure that Your request is honored, You must provide Electronic Team with information sufficient for Electronic Team to accurately identify and access Your records. The information Electronic Team requires is Your full name, address and the email address You provided to Electronic Team when You requested Services or products. This information or any other information per each individual case, requested is viewed as sufficient for Electronic Team to ensure You are who You proclaim to be. Electronic Team reserves the right to contact You to verify that it has accurately identified Your record.
California Residents
If You are a California resident, You can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information that Electronic Team may share with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this notice, please submit Your request to Electronic Team’s Data Protection Officer at
dpo@electronic.us
. Please allow 30 days for a response. For Your protection and the protection of all of Electronic Team’s users, Electronic Team may ask You to provide proof of identity before it can answer such a request. Electronic Team does not respond to general do not track (DNT) requests.
F. RIGHTS OF EUROPEAN USERS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)
Electronic Team complies with the principles of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 “On the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (“

If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to provide a service, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b). The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning Electronic Team products or Services. If Electronic Team is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)(c). If the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect Your vital interests or that of another Qualified Individual, then the processing is based on Art. 6(1)(d). Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1)(f) if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Electronic Team or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by Your fundamental rights and freedoms under the GDPR.
GDPR Rights:
(i) Right of Confirmation
You may obtain confirmation of whether or not Your personal data is being processed. If You wish to exercise Your right of confirmation, You may contact Electronic Team using the contact information as provided in

Section G
, below.
(iv) Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)
You may request the erasure of Your personal information by contacting Electronic Team using the contact information provided in

, hereof. Furthermore, You may delete Your User Account information by accessing Your User Account settings page on the Website. Please note that while any changes You make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable time, Electronic Team may retain all information You submit for the prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where Electronic Team otherwise reasonably believes that it has a legitimate reason to do so, such as for archiving purposes within the public interest.
(v) Right to Restriction of Processing
As a Qualified Individual, You have the right to restrict processing where one of the following applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of the controllers use of such data;
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or
The data subject has objected to processing pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
(vi) Right to Data Portability
You may request to receive Your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit this data to another controller without interference.
Furthermore, You may have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and where such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
(vii) Right to Object and Automated Decision Making
You may object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects You, as long as the decision is not (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between You and Electronic Team; (ii) authorized by European Union or Member State law to which You are subject; or (iii) based on the data subject’s explicit consent.
(viii) Right to Object to Processing
You may object to the processing of Your personal data using the contact information provided in
Section G
below, unless there are legitimate grounds for the processing within the public interest, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
If Electronic Team processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, You shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of Your personal data for such purposes. This right also applies to profiling to the extent that the processing is related to such direct marketing purposes. If You object to Electronic Team processing Your personal data for direct marketing purposes, then Electronic Team will no longer process the personal data for such purposes.
Retention Policy
Electronic Team only retains personally identifiable information about You for as long as Your User Account remains active and for as long as it needs to provide You with Services or otherwise fulfill the purposes for which Electronic Team had initially collected such information, unless otherwise required by law. Electronic Team will retain and use information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, for archival purposes, to assist in the resolve of disputes, and to enforce its agreements.
Cross-Border Data Transfers
If and when sharing of information involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions, Electronic Team uses EU Standard Contract Clauses or other suitable contracts and safeguards to permit data transfers from the EU to other countries. The Standard Contractual Clauses commit companies transferring and receiving Your personal information to protecting the privacy and security of Your data. Copies of Electronic Team’s current Standard Contractual Clauses are available on request using the contact details listed below.

3. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.
A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other similar technologies on our Websites or emails to, among other things:
Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;
Collect statistics regarding your Website usage;
Provide us with information to support technical functionality of service, improve the Website experience and measure marketing effectiveness; and
In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain Websites owned by such third parties.
There are several different kinds of cookies, and should we be deploying cookies we (or a third party provider be deploying them in connection with our ecommerce activities) would be using one of the following common types of cookies, which may be persistent cookies or session cookies:
Essential cookies
are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our Websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.
Analytics or customization cookies
collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the Website for you.
Advertising cookies and tracking scripts
are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.
If the Website includes a cookie management tool, you will typically find a hover button at the bottom of your screen. If in the future you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our Websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.
Do-Not-Track.
There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that our Websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals. For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit
http://www.youronlinechoices.com
.
Third Party Data Collection.
This may also include cookies placed by third parties, to deliver tailored information and content which may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third party websites after you have left our Websites. We do not permit these third parties to collect Personal Information about you (such as email address) on our Website, nor do we share with them any Personal Information about you.
Social Media Features and Widgets
.  Our Websites may include social media features, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button. These features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Currently, we use the features and widgets (“
Plugins
”) of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn offered by the companies Facebook Inc., Google Inc., Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corporation (“
Providers
”).
Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“

LinkedIn is operated by LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale CA 94085, USA (“
LinkedIn
”). You will find an overview on LinkedIn’s Plugin and what they look like here:
https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins
When you access one of our Websites, which contains a Plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The content of the Plugin is transferred by the respective Provider directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the Website. Integration of the Plugin allows the Provider to receive the information that you have accessed the respective Website even if you do not maintain a profile with that Provider or if you are not logged in at the moment. This information (including your IP address) will be transferred by your browser directly to the Provider in the U.S. and stored there. If you are logged in with one of the Providers’ services, they will be able to assign your visit on our Website to your profile with the respective Provider. If you interact with any of the Plugins, e.g. by pressing the ‟Like” or the ‟+1” button, this information will also be sent directly to the server of the Provider and stored there. The information will also be published in the social network on your respective account, e.g. Twitter, and displayed to your contacts there.
For more information on the purpose and extent of the data acquisition and how data are processed and used by the respective Provider as well as regarding your rights and optional settings to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policies of the respective Provider:
Privacy Policy of Facebook:

Privacy Policy of Google:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
Privacy Policy of Twitter:

Privacy Policy of LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy
If you do not want Google, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn to allocate data collected on our Websites to your profile in their service, you must log out of the respective service before visiting our Website. You can prevent the loading of the Plugins completely by using Add-Ons for your browser, e.g. the script-blocker ‟NoScript” (
http://noscript.net/
).
If you accept a session or persistent cookie, you can delete it at any time through your web browser (e.g., as soon as you leave our Ecommerce Engine).  If you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Ecommerce Engine.
We and our partners use third party service providers in connection with this Ecommerce Engine and our business to gather user metrics and usage data. These service providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Ecommerce Engine or to a Website, your interaction with our Ecommerce Engine or that Website, and the products and services offered by us, our partners and our suppliers through the use of cookies, pixel tags, JavaScript code or other web technologies. This information may be transferred to servers in the U.S. and stored there. We and our partners may use this anonymous information to provide targeted advertisements to you for goods and services, for marketing analysis, and for quality improvement purposes. Currently, we use the following web tracking services:
Google Analytics
: Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website will normally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will shorten the IP address in EU Member States or other countries of the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the Website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website provider. Google will not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data stored by Google.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website. Furthermore, you can prevent the acquisition of data collected by cookies and relating to your use of the Website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
. Please note that on this Website, Google Analytics code is supplemented by “anonymizeIp”. This allows to process IP addresses in a shortened form to exclude direct reference to a specific person. For more information provided by Google:

4. Sharing Your Personal Information.
We may share your Personal Information in a limited number of circumstances, including with:
Our Partners.
When we make products available for sale through an Ecommerce Engine, we are doing so as an independent ecommerce reSeller of, or service provider for, the partner whose name and/or logo appears as part of the particular Ecommerce Engine. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate that is co-branded with our partner’s branding, we will provide certain of the Personal Information and/or anonymous information you provide in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have previously consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this Ecommerce Engine such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this Ecommerce Engine and our partner’s Website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you. We may also provide certain of the Personal Information you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this Ecommerce Engine.  The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you purchase, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your Personal Information that we provide to them.
Our Service Providers
. We use other companies, which may include but are not limited to present or future corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or on our behalf and help us to operate our business. We may share your information with our service providers in connection with their provision of services to us. We may also allow these companies to use anonymous information, and to use aggregated Personal Information on an anonymous basis (i.e., where the aggregated data cannot identify you personally), for their business purposes.  We will not share your Personal Information with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent. We select our partners and service providers on the basis of their security and confidentiality commitments and their compliance with data protection laws.
To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Ecommerce Engine, You and Others
. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Information we collect on this Ecommerce Engine without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a)  to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; (b) to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; (c) to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); (d) to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (e) to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of FastSpring, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or (f) to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are or may be in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations without providing notice to you. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose Personal Information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In Connection With Corporate Events/Transitions
. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, your Personal Information may become owned by that company in compliance with applicable data protection laws. In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your Personal Information will still be subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Supplemental Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
We do not sell your Personal Information.
5. Security of Your Personal Information
We are committed to keeping your Personal Information secure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative safeguards reasonably designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a financial account number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. We encrypt Personal Information whenever possible and otherwise restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and individuals with a need to know that information.  It is important that you understand, however, that no Ecommerce Engine, Website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your password. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements. Please know, however, that no matter where your Personal Information is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through this Ecommerce Engine, it will be protected by us in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, any Supplemental Privacy Notices that apply to you, and applicable data protection laws.
Cross-Border Transfers of Your Data.
As we operate internationally, and provide you with relevant services through our resources and servers around the globe, sharing your Personal Information across borders is essential. Your Personal Information will be processed on the computer servers (currently Amazon Web Services) in the United States of America on which our Ecommerce Engine is hosted.  In some cases, we may transmit your Personal Information to (i) third party data processors or (ii) product manufacturers, licensors and/or suppliers for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement. To the extent required by applicable data protection laws, we have executed standard contractual clauses to effect the lawful cross-border transfer of personal information.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) Compliance.
FastSpring complies with the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. FastSpring has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF program Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/
.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, FastSpring commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information transferred to the United States pursuant to the DPF Principles. European Union individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints should first contact FastSpring at
privacy@fastspring.com
.
FastSpring has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers
for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See
https://dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2
.
As explained here we sometimes provide Personal Information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer Personal Information received under the EU-U.S. DPF to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the Personal Information must also be in compliance with our EU-U.S. DPF obligations.

We will also retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies.

Legal bases for processing your personal data
We process your personal information based on the following legal bases, as recognised by and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws:
the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you (i.e. the Terms and Conditions that apply as applicable with respect to our services, for the provision of our services), or to take steps requested by you before entering into said contract;
you are obliged to provide us with personal data as it is necessary to enter into and perform our contractual agreements. In the event that you do not wish to provide us with your personal data for the purposes outlined above in the “
HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?
” section, we will not be able to perform our contractual agreement with you;
the processing is in Payoneer’s or someone else’s legitimate interests, and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your personal data. This may include processing your data for identification or prevention of suspicious or high risk transactions or fraudulent activity, internal research and analytics assessments, for purposes of communication with you, and informing you about new products and services we are offering or to promote new products and services of other parties which we think may be of interest to you, etc.;
before we process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests for the purposes outlined above in the “
HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?
” section, we determine if such processing is necessary and we carefully consider the impact of our processing activities on your fundamental rights and freedoms. On balance, we have determined that such processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and that the processing which we conduct does not adversely impact on these rights and freedoms.
you have given your consent to the processing of your data;
the processing is necessary to meet a legal obligation which applies to Payoneer.
Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall within special categories (see section “
HOW, WHEN AND WHAT WE COLLECT?
” for more details), in which case, we use one of the following grounds:
the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
you have freely given your informed, specific consent to the processing; or
the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on applicable law.
If you would like more information about the legal grounds used to process your information, or about the legitimate interests referred to above, please contact us.
In cases where we have asked for, and you have given, your consent to our processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time.  You can do this by contacting our DPO at
DPO@payoneer.com
.
Do you have to give us your personal information?
In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, you will not be able to use our Services. For example, we need details such as your name, address and bank account details so that we can make payments to you and receive payments from you. In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our websites).
Profiling and automated decision making
We may use automated decision making as part of our process to evaluate eligibility for the use of our services. Such decision-making processes are solely automated and do not require human intervention. We use these tools as a measure of fraud prevention and for the purposes of security and risk assessment relating to the performance of our services, to comply with applicable “Anti Money Laundering” (AML) and “Know Your Customer” (KYC) rules and to verify your identity when you become a customer, including for example:
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of your registration application: based on the information you provide, the tool may advise if additional information is required for purpose of approval of your application.
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of certain payment transaction of registered users: such tools may advise if additional information is required for purpose of performance of the payment transaction.
Automated tools used to verify your identity to enable us to comply with AML and KYC rules applicable to us as a financial services provider. For example, we carry out this process using selfies (self-photographs) and other forms of ID when you register to open an account with us and may also use tools that scan documents for authenticity, classify documents into types, extract required information from the document, approve or decline the sufficiency of documents you submit and determine if additional information or documents are required.
You have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, where the decision taken has significant effects on you, as detailed below in the
“YOUR RIGHTS UNDER GDPR”
section.

Confirm whether we are processing your personal data.

DPO@payoneer.com
.
You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your personal information unless your request is unfounded, respective or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances.  We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.
Correcting your personal
data
You can ask us to correct any personal data which is inaccurate or incomplete.  This is free of charge.
If we have disclosed the personal data to anyone else, we will tell them about the correction wherever possible.
If we cannot action a request to correct your personal data, we will let you know and explain why this is.
Erasing your personal
data
This right is sometimes referred to as “the right to be forgotten”.  This is not an absolute right but you have the right to have your data erased, free of charge, in certain circumstances.
You can ask for your personal data to be erased where:
it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed;
we are processing your personal data based on your consent, and you withdraw that consent;
you object to the processing and we do not have an overriding legitimate interest for continuing;
your personal data has been unlawfully processed;
your personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation;
the personal data was processed to offer information society services to a child.
There are some exceptions to this right.  If one of these applies, we do not have to delete the personal data.
If we have disclosed your personal data to third parties, we will tell them about the erasure of your data unless this is impossible or would involve disproportionate effort.
Please note, in connection with such requests, that personal data may be either deleted or retained in an aggregated manner without being linked to any identifiers or personal data, depending on technical commercial capability.
Restricting the processing of your personal
data
You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of charge.  This is not an absolute right.  If processing is restricted we can store the personal data and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or for reasons of important public interest, but we cannot further process your personal data.

if you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing until we have made sure the personal data is accurate;
if you object to our processing pending the verification of whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with legal proceedings;
if the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your personal data;
if we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
If we have disclosed the data to a third party, we will inform them about the restriction unless it is impossible or would require a disproportionate effort.  We will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your personal data.
Objecting to the processing of your personal
data
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. This request will befree of charge.  It is not an absolute right, but you can object to our processing of your personal data where it is:
based on the legitimate interest ground; or
for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
We will stop processing your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless we are processing the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
You can require us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  We will stop as soon as we receive your request.  There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.
Data Portability
This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.  It applies where the following conditions are met:
you provided the personal data to us yourself;
we are processing the personal data either based on your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
We will provide your personal data free of charge in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form.
Automated decision making and profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing and which produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you. In certain circumstances where automated decision making is used, you will be provided with an opt-out option by way of an alternative means of processing.
We will tell you about any automated decision making that affects you.  You have the right to:
request human intervention;
express your point of view; and
challenge the decision.
These rights are not absolute. We may not be able to comply with your request to obtain human intervention, obtain your point of view or to contest a decision, if the processing of personal data is:
necessary for us to enter into or perform a contract with you;
authorised by law (e.g. for fraud prevention) and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your right, freedoms and legitimate interests; or
based on your explicit consent.
Dealing with requests to exercise your rights
We will respond to your request without undue delay at the latest within one (1) month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we may extend this by two (2) months.  We will let you know if we are going to take longer than one (1) month in dealing with your request.  If we have a lot of information about you we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive.  This will help us action your request more quickly.
For the purpose of complying with your requests to exercise the rights listed above, we shall perform the necessary internal processes to identify you.
We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and other laws that govern the handling of personal information. The terms below apply to Australian customers in addition to the terms in the rest of the Policy.

We may also disclose such information as required or permitted by any law, for example to meet our obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).
You may request to access or correct any personal information we hold about you. We will provide our reasons if we deny any request for access to or correction of personal information. Where we decide not to make a requested correction to your personal information, and you disagree, you may ask us to make a note of your requested correction with the information.

assessing the security measures taken at any place your data is transferred to;
having suitable contract terms in place that oblige a data processor to only process in accordance with our instructions; and

We will notify you of the CRBs that we use.
We may also be required to check the validity of your identification documents with the Australia Document Verification Service (DVS).

The information below is required under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended, including by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations, each as amended (together, the “CCPA”)). The terms below apply to residents in the State of California in addition to the terms in the rest of the Policy.
These terms below do not address or apply to our handling of personal information that is exempt under the CCPA.
Information collection, use and disclosure
Categories of Personal Information Collected and Disclosed
While our processing of personal information varies based upon our relationship and interactions with you, we describe generally, the categories of personal information (as defined by the CCPA) that we have collected about California residents, as well as the categories of third parties to whom we may disclose that information for a business or commercial purpose above under “
HOW, WHEN AND WHAT WE COLLECT?
” and “
How and Why We Disclose Your Information
” in the main part of the Policy under the heading “
WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?
”.
In addition, where we use, disclose or process de-identified data (data that is no longer reasonably linked or linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person, household, or personal or household device) we will maintain and use the information in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information, except in order to determine whether our de-identification processes are reasonable and adequate pursuant to applicable privacy laws.
Sources of Personal Information
In general, we may collect personal information directly from you, from other customers and users of our services, from advertising networks and from providers of data analytics.
Purposes of Collection, Use and Disclosure
As described in more detail above under “How and Why We Disclose Your Information” in the main part of the Policy under the heading “
WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?
”, we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information for the following business and commercial purposes and as otherwise directed by you:
Services and support.
Analytics and improvement.
Customization and personalization.
Marketing and advertising.
Planning and managing events.
Research and surveys.
Security and protection of rights.
Legal proceedings and obligations.
To process job applications.
In support of business transfers (e.g., if we are acquired by another company).
Notwithstanding the above, we only use and disclose sensitive personal information as reasonably necessary (i) to perform our services requested by you, (ii) to help ensure security and integrity, including to prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents, (iii) to detect, prevent and respond to malicious, fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal conduct, (iv) to verify or maintain the quality and safety of our services, (v) for compliance with our legal obligations, (vi) to our service providers who perform services on our behalf, and (vii) for purposes other than inferring characteristics about you.

Retention
We retain your personal information for at least such period required in order to meet our obligations under applicable laws or regulations and, to the extent not prohibited under applicable law, such additional period in accordance with our internal policies and procedures for purposes of prevention of fraudulent activities, risk management and security.
Does payoneer “sell” or “share” personal information under the ccpa?
The CCPA defines “sale” as disclosing or making available personal information to a third-party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and “sharing” includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third-party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, under the CCPA’s broad definitions we may be considered to be “selling” or “sharing” personal information because we use third party advertising and analytics tools. Therefore, we may be considered as “selling” or “sharing” the following categories of personal information with third parties, such as social networks, and advertising and analytics services vendors, through our use of cookies and other online tracking tools: Identifiers, Internet or Other Similar Network Activity; Device Information. We do so to advertise our products and services and to collect and analyze certain information about your online activity. You can opt out by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”
link here
.  We do not sell or share sensitive personal information, nor do we sell or share any personal information about individuals who we know are under sixteen (16) years old.

” section, we determine if such processing is necessary and we carefully consider the impact of our processing activities on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Do you have to give us your personal information?
In most cases, providing your personal information to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, you will not be able to use our services. For example, we need details such as your name, address and bank account details so that we can make payments to you and receive payments from you. In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal information, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our websites).
Profiling and automated decision making
We may use automated decision making as part of our process to evaluate eligibility for the use of our services. Such decision-making processes are solely automated and do not require human intervention. We use these tools as a measure of fraud prevention and for the purposes of security and risk assessment relating to the performance of our services, to comply with applicable “Anti Money Laundering” (
AML
) and “Know Your Customer” (
KYC
) rules and to verify your identity when you become a customer, including for example:
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of your registration application: based on the information you provide, the tool may advise if additional information is required for the approval of your application.
Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of certain payment transaction of registered users: such tools may advise if additional information is required for the performance of the payment transaction.
Automated tools used to verify your identity to enable us to comply with AML and KYC rules applicable to us as a financial services provider. For example, we carry out this process using selfies (
self-photographs
) and other forms of ID when you register to open an account with us and may also use tools that scan documents for authenticity, classify documents into types, extract required information from the document, approve or decline the sufficiency of documents you submit and determine if additional information or documents are required.
You have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, where the decision taken has significant effects on you, as detailed below in the “
YOUR RIGHTS UNDER UK DATA PROTECTION LAWS
” section.
How long do we keep your personal information?
Payoneer retains your personal information for the duration of your engagement with us and for a period following termination of your engagement with us, as required by applicable laws or regulations and/or in accordance with Payoneer’s internal policies and procedures for purposes of prevention of fraudulent activity, risk management and security. Payoneer will periodically review the necessity of retention of your personal information.
Your rights under uk data protection laws
You have several rights in relation to your personal information which are described in more detail below.  You can exercise your rights at any time.
For requests related to deleting your personal information or receiving a copy of your personal information, you can contact us at any time by using this
online form
.
For additional queries related to privacy and personal information you can contact our Data Protection Officer at
DPO@payoneer.com
.
Accessing your data
You can ask us to:
Confirm whether we are processing your personal information.
Give you a copy of that personal information.
Provide you with other information about your personal information such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it outside of the UK and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we carry out any automated decision making or profiling.  We aim to give you all this information in this Policy, although if anything is unclear, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
DPO@payoneer.com
.
You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your personal information unless your request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or if you request further copies, in which case we may charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances.  We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.
Correcting your personal information
You can ask us to correct any personal information which is inaccurate or incomplete.  This is free of charge.
If we have disclosed the personal information to anyone else, we will tell them about the correction wherever possible.
If we cannot action a request to correct your personal information, we will let you know and explain why this is.
Erasing your personal information
This right is sometimes referred to as “the right to be forgotten”.  This is not an absolute right but you have the right to have your personal information erased, free of charge, in certain circumstances.
You can ask for your personal information to be erased where:
it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed;
we are processing your personal information based on your consent, and you withdraw that consent;
you object to the processing and we do not have an overriding legitimate interest for continuing;
your personal information has been unlawfully processed;
your personal information must be erased to comply with a legal obligation;

There are some exceptions to this right.  If one of these applies, we do not have to delete the personal information.
If we have disclosed your personal information to third parties, we will tell them about the erasure of your personal information unless this is impossible or would involve disproportionate effort.
Please note, in connection with such requests, that personal information may be either deleted or retained in an aggregated manner without being linked to any identifiers or personal information, depending on technical commercial capability.
Restricting the processing of your personal information
You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in some circumstances, free of charge.  This is not an absolute right.  If processing is restricted we can store the personal information and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or for reasons of important public interest, but we cannot further process your personal information.
You can restrict the processing of your personal information in the following cases:
if you contest the accuracy of your personal information, we will restrict processing until we have made sure the personal information is accurate;
if you object to our processing pending the verification of whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with legal proceedings;
if the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your personal information;
if we no longer need the personal information but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
If we have disclosed the personal information to a third party, we will inform them about the restriction unless it is impossible or would require a disproportionate effort.  We will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your personal information.
Objecting to the processing of your personal
information
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal information at any time. This request will befree of charge.  It is not an absolute right, but you can object to our processing of your personal information where it is:
based on the legitimate interest ground; or
for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
We will stop processing your personal information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless we are processing the personal information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
You can require us to stop using your personal information for direct marketing purposes.  We will stop as soon as we receive your request.  There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.
Data Portability
This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal information for your own purposes across different services.  It applies where the following conditions are met:
you provided the personal information to us yourself;
we are processing the personal information either based on your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
We will provide your personal information free of charge in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form.
Automated decision making and profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing, and which produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you. In certain circumstances where automated decision making is used, you will be provided with an opt-out option by way of an alternative means of processing.
We will tell you about any automated decision making that affects you.  You have the right to:
request human intervention;
express your point of view; and
challenge the decision.
These rights are not absolute. We may not be able to comply with your request to obtain human intervention, obtain your point of view or to contest a decision, if the processing of personal information is:
necessary for us to enter into or perform a contract with you;
authorised by law (e.g., for fraud prevention) and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your right, freedoms and legitimate interests; or
based on your explicit consent.
Dealing with requests to exercise your rights
We will respond to your request without undue delay at the latest within one (1) month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we may extend this by two (2) months.  We will let you know if we are going to take longer than one (1) month in dealing with your request.  If we have a lot of information about you we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive.  This will help us action your request more quickly.
For the purpose of complying with your requests to exercise the rights listed above, we shall perform the necessary internal processes to identify you.

PayPal Privacy Statement
Last updated on February 13, 2025
Overview
PayPal, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “PayPal”) provides this Privacy Statement to describe our use of your Personal Information when you use your PayPal account, Xoom account, visit our websites, or apply for, or use our Services, like Braintree and Zettle. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Excluded Services, such as Venmo and Hyperwallet.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to use it to help you make informed decisions.
Certain capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in the Statement are explained in the
Definitions
section below.
We revise this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "
Policy Updates
" or "
Privacy Statement
" page of our website, otherwise the revised Privacy Statement will be effective as of the published effective date. If you are a new User or are receiving this Privacy Statement for the first time and there is an upcoming change described on the
Policy Updates
or Privacy Statement page at the time you receive this Privacy Statement, such upcoming change will apply to you on the indicated effective date.
For most of our Services, we act as a “data controller” or “business”, however there are some products and features where PayPal may also act as a “data processor” or “service provider” when providing services to our Partners and Merchants.  The “data controller” or “business” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that has the control over the purposes and means by which the data processing is performed.  The “data processor” or “service provider” (each as defined under applicable data protection laws) is the entity that processes the Personal Information for the data controller, for the data controller’s specific purposes, and as otherwise permitted under applicable data protection laws.
Non-Account Holders and Fastlane Profile Users
Our Services may be accessed by individuals without a PayPal or Xoom account. We will collect Personal Information from you even if you are a non-account holder when you use our Services, such as when you use our Pay Without a PayPal account, use Unbranded Payment Services (e.g., Braintree and Zettle), use a Fastlane profile, or when a non-accountholder receives a payment through the Visa+ service from a PayPal account holder (“Recipient”). If you Pay Without a PayPal account, we may link your transaction information with your PayPal account, if you have one at the time you use the Service without logging in, or if you create a PayPal account later.
With a Fastlane profile, individuals can store their payment methods and other Personal Information with PayPal so that they can complete the checkout process faster,  create a store or loyalty account, or facilitate other transactions at participating Partners and Merchants with payment card, contact information, shipping data or other data they save in their Fastlane profile as relevant to the specific interaction, participating Partner or Merchant, all without having to manually input payment method details and other Personal Information each time they checkout ("Fastlane").
When you create a Fastlane profile, you are agreeing to let PayPal store your Personal Information, including your name, email, phone number, address information, billing information and payment method details, and other data that may be relevant to specific Partner or Merchant interactions, and pre-populate that information in the checkout flows or other interactive features of participating Partners and Merchants so that you can  enjoy a faster Partner and Merchant experience by not having to manually input  your payment or other information. We will also collect transaction and other Partner or Merchant data related to your purchases and other Partner or Merchant interactions when you use Fastlane. If you have a Fastlane profile, we may recognize you as a Fastlane user when you shop on the participating Partners’ and Merchants’ sites, and we may prompt you to engage in participating Partner or Merchant interactions, such as registering for a store or loyalty account using your Fastlane profile information. If you choose to interact with participating Partners or Merchants through Fastlane, you agree to let PayPal disclose your Fastlane profile information to the Participating Partners and Merchants and their service providers, and to facilitate your transaction and shopping experience on the participating Partners and Merchants sites.
The Visa+ Service enables eligible customers with a PayPal account to send and receive money to and from Venmo and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).
When you shop on Partner and Merchant sites, the Partner or Merchant may disclose Personal Information with PayPal that we will use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the relevant PayPal user agreement.

that Personal Information disclosed to Partners and Merchants (or their
service providers) involved in a transaction is subject to the Partners' and Merchants' own privacy policies and
procedures. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of Partners and Merchants.
Other third parties

,
for example if we are involved in a merger, a purchase or sale of all or part of our business or assets, including receivables and debts, we may disclose, under appropriate data protection terms, your Personal Information to an interested or actual buyer of those business or assets. If PayPal or a significant portion of PayPal’s assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information may also be disclosed.
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information?
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or is permitted in context of the purpose for which it was collected and consistent with applicable law.
The criteria used to determine our retention period is as follows:
Personal Information used for the ongoing relationship between you and PayPal is stored for the duration of the relationship plus a period of 10 years, unless we need to keep it longer, such as:
a legal obligation or compliance with laws to which we are subject is retained consistent with the applicable law, such as under applicable bankruptcy laws and AML obligations
litigation, investigations, audit and compliance practices, or to protect against legal claims.
We retain biometric data for as long as needed or permitted given the purpose for which it was collected and no more than 3 years after your account closes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?
When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services.
We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and generate inferences as described above.
You can disable or decline some Cookies for our Services. But, since some parts of our service rely on Cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.
Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.
If you want to know more about how we use cookies, please review our
Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Your Data Protection Rights
Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.
Under applicable data protection law, depending upon the jurisdiction in which you reside and subject to applicable exceptions and definitional differences among various state laws, you may have certain rights about how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.
We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know your information), right to know third-parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information, correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt-out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).
Certain state laws also provide residents of those states with the right to opt out of the “sale” (disclosing Personal Information in exchange for money or other consideration) or “sharing” (disclosing Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising) of your Personal Information or use of your Personal Information for certain types of targeted advertising.  Global Privacy Control settings is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. PayPal does not respond to the Global Privacy Control signal because we do not sell or share your data.
We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights; although, certain personalized services for PayPal customers may not provide the same level of personalization with limited data sharing. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we handle your
Privacy Rights
.
How do you exercise your rights?
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information,
contact us
or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.
If you, or an authorized agent where permitted, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information in your Fastlane profile,
contact us
or submit your request from your Fastlane profile management portal.
Even if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our
Contact Information
section.
We’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.
Your
right to request a copy of the Personal Information
. If you want to request the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and submit a request
Call or contact us
and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected.
Your right
to correct your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and correct any information that you've previously added. For example, you can edit your addresses in your settings
Call or contact us
and request that we correct specific information
Your right
to delete your Personal Information:
Log in to your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile management portal, and delete any information that you've previously added. For example, you may delete your non-primary addresses in your settings
Call us or contact us
and request that we delete specific information
Close your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile
If you close your PayPal or Xoom account, or Fastlane profile, or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in
How long does PayPal store your Personal Information
section so we can:
Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us
Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services
Comply with laws and other legal or governmental processes
California also offers a right to opt out of “Selling” and “Sharing” Personal Information. The Global Privacy Control setting is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their personal information. PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some personal information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our
Consumer Privacy Notice
for more information about their rights under US federal law.
Understanding your choices
You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.
Choose how we collect Personal Information
You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function.
For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.
Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information
If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.
You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.
Choose what we disclose with other Users
Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.
Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized Shopping
Unless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences. Personal Information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you’ll like. To opt-out of Personal Information sharing with Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences, log into your PayPal account and edit your preferences in the Data and Privacy setting. If you opt-out, we will continue to disclose your Personal Information as necessary to complete transactions you initiate but will not disclose Personal Information to Partners and Merchants for personalized shopping experiences.
Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.
You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt-out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.
You won’t be able to opt-out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and account/Fastlane profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current. We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on a linked account connection that you have authorized.
Can Children Use Our Services?
We do not knowingly collect information, including Personal Information, from children under the age of 13 or other individuals who are not legally allowed to use our Services. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information from someone not allowed to use our Services, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data.
Please
contact us
if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone not allowed to use our Services.
We do not sell to third parties for money, or share Personal Information of anyone under 16 years of age, for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising.

CCPA California Notice at Collection
Most of the Personal Information we collect is subject to federal and state privacy laws that apply to financial institutions. To the extent the Personal Information is not subject to these federal and state financial privacy laws and to the extent it is collected in California about California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may apply. The following section pertains only to Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA (“CCPA personal information”) and makes statements that reference unique definitions and requirements of law.
This CCPA California Notice at Collection describes: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “CCPA personal information” we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose CCPA personal information for a business purpose, and/or (b) “share” CCPA personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or (c) “sell” such CCPA personal information, as applicable.
Under California law, “sharing” is defined as the sharing or disclosure of CCPA personal information by a business to a third party, for the targeting of advertising to a consumer, based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s CCPA activity across businesses, websites, applications, or services, other than those with which a consumer uses or directs a business to internally disclose CCPA personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties. “Selling” is defined as the disclosure of CCPA personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, but does not apply to such disclosures when a consumer uses or directs a business to intentionally disclose CCPA personal information or interact with one or more third parties.
We do not sell or share your CCPA personal information, including any Sensitive CCPA personal information, outside the exceptions.
We also do not sell or share, and have no actual knowledge that we have sold or shared any CCPA personal information of anyone under 16 years of age.
For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose CCPA personal information, please see the “Categories of Personal Information We Collect”, “How is Personal Information used,” and “Do We Disclose Personal Information” sections.

REGIONAL PRIVACY DISCLOSURES
Residents of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom
Tipalti is considered the “data controller” of the “personal data” (as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation) we handle under this Privacy Policy. In other words, Tipalti is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose personal data, subject to applicable law. The laws of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose personal data to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we will process your personal data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.
With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the basis of your consent.
Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
Legal Compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

“Sale” and “sharing” of personal information
The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” or “share” personal information. Where we refer to “sell” or “share” (or their variants) in quotes, we are referring to those terms as uniquely defined in the CCPA.
We may use third-party analytics services and online advertising services that may result in the “sharing” of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, general location information, and usage information) with advertising partners to advertise the Services on other websites. If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of our “sharing” of your information for such purposes, you may do so by clicking

Retention of your personal information
Please see the Data Retention section above.
CCPA rights
California residents can make requests about their personal information as described as set forth in Choices and Data Subject Rights above. The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.

Performance of Contract - We will process Your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party or to take steps at Your request before entering into such a contract. As well, if You are a card-holder or alternative payment method user making a payment to a merchant using our services to process Your payment, We may process Your data on the basis of the agreement that We have with the merchant and terms and conditions You agree to.

Some data, such as the types of used services and how many users We receive daily, may be used by 2Checkout for statistical, marketing, promotional, or any other lawful purposes. This kind of information is collected in aggregate/statistical form, without identifying any user individually.
In any case, We will not subject You to a decision based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning You or similarly significantly affects You, unless You explicitly consented to the processing, the processing is necessary for entering into, or performance of a contract between You and Us, or when We are legally required / entitled to use Your personal data in this way, for example to prevent fraud.
5. Children's privacy

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide
.
Go to Privacy Checkup
Managing, reviewing, and updating your information
When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.
We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your
Google Account
includes:
Privacy controls
Activity Controls
Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings
Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data

Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the

123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity at
My Activity
.
activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.
You can
learn more
about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.
ads you’ll find most useful
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more
about Google ads
and
why you may see particular ads
.
advertising and research services on their behalf
For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android device with Google apps
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about
Google Play Services
.
appropriate safeguards
For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you.

data controller responsible for processing your information
This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
deliver our services
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.

A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
detect abuse
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including
child sexual abuse and exploitation material
), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
devices
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.
Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.
Learn more
our users
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights.

partner with Google
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.
Learn more
payment information
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account.
Learn more
personalized ads
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.
Learn more
phone number
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.
Learn more
Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.
Learn more
remove
For example, as described above, you can
request to remove content
, including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.
safety and reliability
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.
Sensor data from your device
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about
how we use location information.
servers around the world
For example, we operate data centers located
around the world
to help keep our products continuously available for users.
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
show trends
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.
Learn more
similar information related to your physical or mental health
If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
specific Google services
For example, you can delete
your blog
from Blogger or
a Google Site you own
from Google Sites. You can also delete
reviews
you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
specific partners
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.
Learn more
about these partners and how they use your information.

.
the public
For example, we process information about
requests to remove content
from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.
Learn more
If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
