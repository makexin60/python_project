We use cookies (information stored by your browser) to track information on the pages read by visitors to our sites to improve the content and offerings on our sites. Cookies are small text files that websites can send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user’s identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned. The cookies we use are “analytical” cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our sites when they are using them. Read more about the individual analytical cookies we use and how to recognise them ataboutcookies.GoGames.com. Although we cannot identify individuals from this information, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003, as amended by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (the "Directive"), recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of website users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used (which is exactly what we are doing here!), and to provide some information on how cookies are used.
You can find more information on this subject at
www.allaboutcookies.org
. Lastly, the Directive places an obligation on websites to make users aware that they can set their computers to reject cookies. You can do this by activating a setting in your internet browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. You can find instructions on how to do this at
www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you first access our websites. However, you should be aware that our websites will not work without cookies and therefore we recommend you leave them turned on.
