Data Protection and Privacy Procedure and Collection Statements
Data Protection and Privacy Procedure
The Monash University Data Protection and Privacy Procedure provides a general statement about how personal, sensitive and health information is managed by the University. Please view the
Data Protection and Privacy Procedure (pdf).
Data Protection and Privacy Collection Statements
A Data Protection and Privacy Collection Statement is information provided at the time of collecting personal information (or as soon as practicable thereafter) that explains such things as the purpose of collecting the information. The provision of a privacy collection statement is a requirement of the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic).
Our Data Protection and Privacy Collection Statements include:
the purposes for which the personal information is collected;
the type of organisations to whom the information may be disclosed;
any law requiring collection;
the main consequences if the information requested is not provided;
any right to access personal information; and
how to contact the University.
Monash University has dedicated Data Protection and Privacy Collection Statements for different groups and activities (see table). These Collection Statements apply to the handling of personal information for Australian campuses of Monash University and for Monash Prato. Monash Malaysia and Monash Indonesia have their own collection statements listed below the main table.
