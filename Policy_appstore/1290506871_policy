    responsible for their collection, use, or disclosure of personal data.
    We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any external sites
    they visit to understand their data handling practices. Engaging with

If you choose to log in or register through third-party platforms,
    such as Google or Facebook, we will receive limited personal
    information, including your name and email address. This transfer occurs
    in accordance with the respective platform’s privacy policies, which
    govern how your data is collected, used, and shared. While we only

    not control the data practices of these platforms. We recommend
    reviewing their privacy policies for details on how your personal

When users access CryptoPanic via a mobile device, we may collect
    specific information to enhance the user experience. This includes the
    type of device being used, which helps us optimize the interface for
    various screen sizes, as well as the operating system, enabling us to

9. User Forums
Any information shared in user forums or chat features is considered
    public and may be accessible to other users and third parties.
    Therefore, we strongly advise users to refrain from disclosing any
    personal data or sensitive information in these areas. The public nature
    of these platforms means that once information is posted, it can be
    easily viewed, shared, and potentially misused by others. Users should
    exercise caution and discretion in their communications to protect their
    privacy and minimize the risk of unauthorized exposure of their personal
    information.

    ongoing commitments associated with those services. For users with a PRO
    membership, personal data will be retained for the entire duration of
    the subscription. Upon termination of the subscription, we will continue
    to retain your data as required by relevant legal retention periods,
    which may vary depending on the nature of the data and applicable
    regulations. After these retention periods expire, we will take
    appropriate measures to securely delete or anonymize your personal data,
    ensuring that it is no longer identifiable or usable in any form.
11. Data Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect
    personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
    destruction. These measures include access controls, encryption,
    security audits, and data minimization. Our systems and processes are
    monitored and updated to maintain a level of protection in line with
    industry standards, supporting the security of personal data throughout
    its processing and storage.

            but cease processing without consent during restriction.

Right to Object
You may object to processing based on
            legitimate interests or for direct marketing. If exercised, we will
            cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling, overriding
