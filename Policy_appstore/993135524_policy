Global Careers Privacy policy
Introduction
At Dyson we are committed to ensuring that your personal data is protected and never misused.
The Global Careers Privacy Notice applies to personal data collected in the course of prospective employee search, recruitment, selection and onboarding process.  It explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, the controls you have over your personal data and the procedures that we have in place to protect your personal data.
In this notice, when we refer to "Dyson", "us", "we" or "our", we mean the Dyson group company or companies that you apply to, or correspond with, and which are responsible for any personal data collected about you.  In this Careers Privacy Notice, we refer to all Dyson group companies as the "Dyson Group".
Privacy Principles
Privacy policies can be complicated. We have tried to make ours as clear and as accessible as possible. To help, we have also summarised how we handle your personal information at Dyson in our privacy principles below. These principles demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information in the right way and as you would expect it to be handled.
At Dyson we:
Will only ask for or collect the personal information we need.
Give you control over the personal information we hold about you.
Make sure your personal information is always secure and protected.
Are fair and transparent about how we use the personal information we hold.
Only ever use your personal information for the purpose that you trusted us to use it for.
Will never sell your personal information and only share it as outlined in our privacy policy or when you ask us to.
Respect your choices and will inform you if there are important changes that affect your personal information or how we use it.
Take responsibility for the personal information that we hold about you.
What personal data do we collect?
It is not necessary for us to collect every personal detail about you. Our main reasons for collecting your personal data are to support your application to Dyson and to comply with our own legal obligations.
Personal data is defined slightly differently across the world. To guarantee your privacy and the protection of your information, we define it as any information that could be used to identify you or another individual.
We collect personal data from you in a number of different ways; you may share that information with us directly, or we may collect it using other means (for example, from third parties).
Information you share with us
You may provide information to us when you apply for a role listed on our Careers website, contact us about an opportunity to work at Dyson, upload a CV or resume or take part in an interview or selection process.
Through these interactions you may share with us, for example:
your name;
your address;
your e­mail address;
your phone number;
your career history (usually in the form of a CV); and
video footage of yourself (for example, as part of a video interview).
If you visit Dyson premises as part of the selection process, we will capture your image on our video surveillance systems, such as CCTV. The purpose of these systems is to prevent crime and promote staff security and public safety. This footage may be used for investigation and relevant further action.
You may also share details of other people with us; for example, if somebody else referred the job to you (someone you know at Dyson or otherwise). In those circumstances, you will need to check with that person that they are happy for you to share their personal data with us.
Information we collect from other sources
We collect some personal data about you from other sources; namely, previous employer(s), your references, recruitment agencies and from providers of services that allow us to verify the details that you provide to us (for example, when we undertake criminal records or identification checks). We collect as little personal data as possible during the recruitment processes; if you are successful, then we will undertake more detailed pre-employment screening and vetting.
You can also register for an account on the Careers website by logging in through LinkedIn.  In this case, we will collect certain additional personal data from your LinkedIn account (such as your career history and previous experience).
Third party websites and social media
We use social media (such as LinkedIn), job boards and online sites to find and contact potential candidates for roles at Dyson.  This involves collecting some personal data about potential candidates from those sites.
If you use social media (such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn) and make your profile(s) visible to the public, we may review your social media profile(s) and use the contact information to contact you.
Social media sites, job boards and similar online sites are responsible for their use of your personal data and will use it for the purposes set out in their privacy notices.
​
Information from your online interactions
Please read our
Cookie Policy
for information about how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our websites.
Please note that we do not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
How do we use your personal data?
We may use your personal data in the following ways:
To search for suitable candidates for our roles;
To facilitate any application you make to Dyson;
To communicate with you;
To carry out administration tasks within the Dyson Group,
To promote and monitor equal opportunities within Dyson (in countries where this is required and legally compliant with local laws; this might include the processing of sensitive personal data including religious or similar belief, and ethnic origin);
To carry out vetting of staff members (where required); this might involve our collection and use of sensitive personal data including information obtained from criminal background checks about offences or alleged offences and information relating to any proceedings for offences committed or allegedly committed;
To establish, exercise or defend our (or a third party's) legal rights;
To protect the rights, property or safety of Dyson, our employees, customers, suppliers or other persons;
To assist in any disputes, claims or investigations relating to your application; and/or
To comply with our legal, regulatory and professional obligations.
You can register on our Careers website for job alerts. If you have asked us to, we will keep you informed of other opportunities at Dyson as well as information about working at Dyson, the James Dyson Foundation and the James Dyson Award. We do this in various ways, including e-mail, post, SMS, via social media platforms and by phone.
Data protection and privacy laws in some countries require us to have what's called a "legal basis" or "lawful ground" for handling personal data. Broadly, that means that we have to have a legal justification for handling your personal data.
Our "legal bases" for handling your personal data for the purposes set out in this Global Careers Privacy Notice are as follows:
our use of your personal data is necessary prior to entering into a contract with you (that is prior to offering you a job with Dyson),
our use of your personal data is necessary for complying with our legal obligations, or
our use is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party (for example, to maintain adequate applicant records).
Where we collect and handle sensitive personal data (for example, medical information, racial or ethnic origin or criminal records information), then we will only handle that information:
where the law permits us to do so, to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise specific legal rights; or
where you have given us your consent – this includes where you have voluntarily provided us with information that we have marked as optional (such as, if you complete our diversity questionnaire).
What personal data does Dyson share with third parties?
Most importantly, we never sell your personal data to anyone and only share it as outlined in this notice or when you ask us to.
Sharing within the Dyson Group
Your personal data will be stored in centrally managed systems that are accessible to other offices in the Dyson Group. Transfers of personal data between Dyson entities (including those outside of the EEA) are governed by Dyson’s Intercompany Agreement.
Sharing with third parties
We share your personal data with certain third parties who provide services on our behalf, such as:
those that help us with administration, including audit services, administrative services, IT technologies (e.g. data storage), security services and insurance claims; and
those that help us with the pre-employment process, including candidate vetting, psychometric ability testing, video interviews and reference checking (if your application is successful).
They only have access to the personal data they need to perform those services. They are required to keep this information confidential and may not use it for their own purposes.
We may share your personal data with third parties whose services we use, such as:
those that assist us with listing our jobs or to reach people who may be interested in Dyson opportunities, such as job sites and social media platforms; and
those that assist us understanding how our website works by setting cookies on our websites.
These third parties are responsible for their use of your personal data and will use it for the purposes set out in their privacy notices.
Finally, we may share your personal data with certain third parties:
if we are required to do so by law, including in response to a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena or to comply with other national, state, provincial or local laws;
where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business (in particular, to facilitate group company restructuring, to sell any of the Dyson companies or acquire or merge with other businesses); and
to support the detection, investigation and prevention of criminal activities, such as law enforcement bodies.
How long do we keep your personal data?
We only keep your personal data for as long as we need to, to be able to use it for the reasons given in this Global Careers Privacy Notice, and for as long as we are required to keep it by law. The actual period for which we store your personal data will vary depending on the type of personal data and how it is used.
Your controls and choices
Where possible, we give you control over the personal data we collect about you. You also have certain rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you. For example, you can update and amend personal data that we hold about you and your communication preferences by logging into your account on the Dyson Careers portal.
You also have the right to request:
Access to the personal data that we hold about you;
We stop using your personal data for certain purposes;
We limit or restrict our use of your personal data;
We remove or delete personal data about you; or
We provide your personal data to a third party provider of services.
For these requests, you can contact the Talent Acquisition team (see
here
for contact details) or the Global Privacy Team at
privacy@dyson.com
. We will send you a link to our privacy portal, using the contact details that you provide, where you will be invited to provide further information about your request and be given further information about how we will process that request.
Please note that those rights do not always apply and there are certain exceptions to them. We will also need to confirm identity before acting on certain requests.
If the law in your country allows us to impose a fee for giving you access to your personal data, or to exercise any of your other rights in relation to your personal data, we will let you know. You will not be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights that apply to you.
How do we protect your personal data?
We are committed to protecting your personal data. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption, to protect your personal data and privacy, and review those regularly. We protect your personal data using a combination of physical and IT security controls, including access controls that restrict and manage the way in which your personal data and data is processed, managed and handled. We also ensure that Dyson personnel are adequately trained in protecting your personal data. Our procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we share your personal data with you.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any portal or account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone.
In the unlikely event that we do suffer a security breach which compromises our protection of your personal data and we need to let you know about it, we will do so.
Data transfers, storage and the global handling of your personal information
The relevant Dyson group company or companies will collect personal data from you in the country in which you live. We, and those third parties that we share your personal data with, then host, store and otherwise handle that information in the UK, in the countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) or in any country outside of the EEA, including those listed in the
Contacts page
.
We will make sure that any transfers of your personal data from one country to another comply with those data protection and privacy laws which apply to us.
European data protection laws, in particular, include specific rules on transferring personal data outside the EEA. Transfers of personal data between Dyson entities (including those outside of the EEA) are governed by Dyson’s Intercompany Agreement.
When transferring personal data outside the EEA, we will:
include standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission for transferring personal data outside the EEA into our contracts with those third parties; or
ensure that the country in which your personal data will be handled has been deemed "adequate" by the European Commission.
In any case, our transfer, storage and handling of your personal data will continue to be governed by this privacy notice.
Changes to this Global Careers Privacy Policy
We will regularly review and update this privacy notice. This privacy notice was last reviewed and updated in July 2020.
If we change our privacy notice in a way that significantly changes how we process the personal data that we hold about you, we will also ask you to confirm that you are happy with those changes.
