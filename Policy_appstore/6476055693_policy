Building a great mobile app is about more than just code. It's about generating a positive ROI for our clients and building experiences that customers love.
About Us
We are a full service mobile app company, based out of Farmington, Utah. We are devoted to providing exceptional customer service. We offer iOS, Android, and web apps as well as product management, user experience design, and marketing expertise.
Your Next Project
If you've got an idea for an app, let's get started. We'll do the first 10 hours up front. If you like what you see, we'll keep going. If not, there is no cost to you. Typical small iOS apps take as little as 15-30 development hours to build and publish and can be completed in 2-3 weeks.
Business Apps
Are you looking to build a new tool to simplify or enhance your business processes? You've come to the right place.
Games
Do you have the next great game idea for the App Store? We can do that too.
Android and Web
We are also able to convert your iOS application to Android or build companion websites for your product.
What Our Clients Are Saying
CodePro Studios was AMAZING to work with. They were quick to respond, worked nights and weekends, quickly made every change we requested, and went above and beyond our expectations. If you need an app reach out to CodePro. You won't regret it!
Alexa Weyland, Recruiting Contractor
I had the pleasure of working with CodePro Studios on the development of a mobile app for my business. They did a fantastic job of listening to my needs and delivering an amazing product that solved the right problem. I really appreciated their collaborative nature and positive energy. They are true product leaders with fantastic app development skills!
Travis Jordan, Founder of Instructional Design Central
CodePro gets things done! I had two developers in a row who never produced a publishable app. CodePro got more done in a long weekend than they did in two years! CodePro Studios also provided excellent business advice on how to market the app. I highly recommend CodePro Studios for your development work!
Andrew Hall, Manager of Business Process
I couldn't have chosen a better company to work with and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with CodePro Studios on the development of my app. They made the app development process feel painless and were great at communicating  progress each step of the way. If you're looking for a great app development company, without a doubt, I highly recommend CodePro Studios!

Our Process
We focus on creating a prototype app as quickly as possible and then iterating with you until it fully meets your needs.
Step 1
Design and Planning
You've got an idea. Let's get together and talk about it. We'll come to an agreement on the core goals you would like to achieve and how quickly we can get there.
Step 2
Prototype Development
There is nothing better than seeing an idea come to life in just a couple days. We will send screenshots, screen recordings, and prototype applications for you to test on your own device to keep you informed all along the way.
Step 3
Iteration and Refinement
Apps often take a few rounds of tweaks to get it just right. We encourage you to take your app out for a testdrive at your business or with your friends and family so that you can test it out and discover what works and what doesn't. We'll help you gather that feedback and apply it to your project.
Step 4
Distribution and Expansion
We are very familiar with the App Store guidelines and how to get your App published as quickly as possible. We provide regular analytics reports about how your app is performing and ideas about what we could improve for future versions.
