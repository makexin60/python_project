Legal basis for processing personal information
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need your personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will normally be to operate our Site and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, or improving our Site. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the details provided below.
Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively,
“Cookies”
) to collect personal information about you and your device when you visit our Site. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our
Cookie Notice
.
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
Third-Party Sites
We may include links to or widgets from other third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We have no control, responsibility or liability for the content and activities resulting from the use of any linked sites, and we encourage you to read the privacy policies on any such third-party sites and proceed only if you are comfortable with such terms.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we or third-party service providers use include anti-virus software and firewalls, access controls, encryption and detection and prevention software.
Guidelines for children and parents
We will not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18 (or the relevant age in your country/region) without prior verifiable parental consent. When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we may only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
Respond directly to the child’s request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes. Once we have responded to such request we will delete the information provided immediately;
Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification; and
Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity.
We will never condition a child’s use of our site on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to use our website.
Data retention
We will retain your information as needed to provide you with the requested services or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements as well as to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States or another host country other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.
Specifically, our Site servers are located in the US, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the UK or EEA in accordance with the UK and/or European Union data protection law, as applicable.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
Data protection rights
Depending on the context and your country or state of residence, you have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to
access, correct, update or request deletion
of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided below.
In addition, you can
object to the processing
of your personal information, ask us to
restrict the processing
of your personal information or
request portability
of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided.
You have the right to
opt out of marketing communications
we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can
withdraw your consent
at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the
right to opt-out of the “sale”
of your personal information to “third parties” at any time. As discussed above, we disclose information with certain third parties for the purposes described above. We do not believe that our disclosure in this regard would qualify as a sale, as we do not provide personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. Nonetheless, if you are a California or a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt-out by emailing us at the contact address provided below.
You have the
right to be notified of any financial incentives
and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without your prior informed opt-in consent. We do not offer any such incentives at this time.
You have the
right to non-discrimination
for the exercise of your data protection rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
You have the
right to complain to a data protection authority
about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) whose details are
available here
.
California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us and our related companies to third parties for third parties direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
You can also authorize an agent to submit a request on your behalf. An authorized agent must have your signed permission to submit a request on your behalf or provide proof that they have power of attorney in accordance with applicable law. Where you use an agent, we will ask for verification of your authorization, namely a copy of your written authorization for the agent to submit the request on your behalf.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Changes to our privacy policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Policy changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.
