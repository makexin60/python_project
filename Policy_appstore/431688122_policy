Excellent. Better than angrybirds.
All the action is on same screen. Non annoying scrolling. Lots of exploding when correct hit is made. Interesting use of dynamic targets i.e. moving train. Characters not as loveable as Birds but this could definite be classed as better game play. Needs lot more levels.

A little cracker!
One of the few games that held my interest enough for me to complete. Some levels cleared at first attempt, others endangered the structural integrity of my phone. Very enjoyable, very addictive, very much looking forward to updates with more levels.... Are those Cowboys coming over the hill???

Finished it! Again!
How many iPhone games do you actually finish? This one is both compelling and fun. And I've just finished it again. Can't wait for the next instalment.
