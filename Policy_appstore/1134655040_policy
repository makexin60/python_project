Personal Information of Minors
While children can use our Services, we do not direct our Services to children under age 16 and are not registering new accounts for users who are under the age of 16. If your child who is under the age of 16 has an existing account please review our
direct notice to parents
. Our separate
Zwift Children’s Privacy Policy
explains the limited ways in which we will use and share your child’s data, as well as the rights you have with respect to that data. If you believe a child under 16 has submitted personal information to us without their parent’s consent, please contact us at
privacy@zwift.com

Do Not Track and Other Universal Opt Out Signals
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals.
We observe the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal with respect to all IP addresses in the US. If you use a browser or a plug-in that recognizes the Global Privacy Control universal opt-out preference signal (“GPC”), we will recognize the signal as applied to the browser and device from which the signal is sent. Browsers and extensions that currently recognize the signal can be found here:

How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure
We implement and maintain reasonable security appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. However, there is no perfect security, and reasonable security is a process that involves risk management rather than risk elimination. While we are committed to maintaining a reasonable information security program, no such program can be perfect; in other words, all risk cannot reasonably be eliminated. Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to factors that cannot reasonably be prevented. Accordingly, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.

The Services may offer social sharing features, links to third-party websites or applications, and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media or visit the websites of other businesses. Your use of social sharing features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. While we may include opportunities to use or connect to these third-party features or third-party websites and applications, we do not control these sites and are not responsible for their data use practices or their use of your information. Please review those entities’ privacy policies for information about how they collect, use and share your personal information.

Zwift Children’s Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 17, 2020
Zwift allows parents to set up accounts for their children (“Children’s Account”). This Children’s Privacy Policy explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from your child’s use of Zwift Services, and how we use and share that information. This policy applies only to Children’s Accounts set up specifically for children over age 5 and under 16. You can find additional information about how Zwift collects, uses, and shares information in our main
Privacy Policy
.
1.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information You Provide Us
When you create an account for your child, we’ll ask that you create a username for your child (please don’t choose one that reflects your child’s real name) and provide other personal information about your child, like their name, date of birth, and the email address that will be used for their login. We’ll also request your name, postal address, phone number, and email address. Please note that the email address provided for your child’s account login cannot be associated with an existing Zwift membership. We’ll request that you or your child provide to us their gender, height, and weight, so that we can accurately calculate information about their workouts. We also collect any information you or your child provide to customize their profile, such as a profile picture or avatar.
Information We Collect From Your Child’s Use of Our Services
When your child works out with Zwift, we collect information about that workout, such as route, cadence, effort, lengthy of ride or run, total output and total calories burned, elevation gain, and, if your child uses a heart rate monitor, your child’s heart rate. We also collect information about any screenshots your child takes, challenges and missions completed, and your child’s experience level (e.g., Academy status), and fitness test results.
2.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We use the information we collect to provide, personalize, and improve our services, to authenticate users’ identities, to track activities and exercise, and to provide customer support. We also use the data we collect for internal purposes such as troubleshooting, protecting against errors, data analysis and testing, to develop new features and services, and to promote the safety and security of Zwift.
3.
HOW YOUR CHILD’S INFORMATION IS SHARED
Sharing with Other Users
Zwift has designed Children’s Accounts so that users of those accounts cannot chat with other users and have more limited ability to interact with other users than do adult users. Please carefully review your child’s settings to make sure you are comfortable with how they are using the Zwift service.
Sharing with Other Third Parties
Information we collect may be shared outside of Zwift in limited circumstances. Children’s Account data will not be shared, sold, or made available to third parties unless one of the following applies:
For External Processing
We provide personal information service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and subject to other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Ownership Changes
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give you notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.
For Legal Reasons
We may disclose information to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person.
4.
HOW TO ACCESS AND DELETE YOUR CHILD’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
As a parent, you have control of and can access your child’s account. As a parent, you can see your child’s activity by following your child with your own Zwift account or signing into your child’s account. You can also change their account password by emailing us at
privacy@zwift.com
.
If at any time you wish to stop further collection or use of your child’s information, you can revoke your consent to the collection by emailing us at
privacy@zwift.com
. If you revoke your consent and later decide to reestablish the Children’s Account, you will need to restart the process for creating a Children’s Account.
5.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR CHILD TURNS 16
When your child turns 16, he or she will be eligible to independently manage his or her account. We will send an email to the email address we have on file for you indicating that your child’s account will be converted to a regular account, and your child will receive a prompt at their next login requesting that they change their password to establish a regular Zwift Account. This regular account will be subject to our main
Privacy Policy
and will incur applicable monthly membership fees in effect at the time your child converts his or her account to a regular account.
6.

Purposes for Collection of Personal Data
Please see Appendix 1 for details of the purposes for which we process your personal data and the legal basis we rely on for such processing.
Consequences of Not Providing Your Personal Data
Where we require your personal data to comply our legal or contractual requirements, failure to provide this information means we may not be able to provide Services to you.
Disclosure of Your Personal Data
Sharing with Other Zwift Users
Part of the fun of Zwift is connecting with other users around the world. So, when you use our Services, we share information about you with other users. This includes your Account registration information and Workout information. This information is available to other users both while you workout and after, and your workout may be broadcast on a service like Twitch TV or YouTube by Zwift or by other users. In addition, your posts on message boards and in discussion rooms will be visible to Zwift and other Zwift users.
Sharing Outside of Zwift
Our Services may also allow you to share your information outside of Zwift. For instance, you may integrate your Zwift account with third-party fitness apps such as Strava, Fitbit, Garmin, and others. When you integrate with other services in this manner, we will share information in accordance with your interactions and preferences which can be managed through the Companion App. In addition, you may choose to share your profile and workout information with select Zwift partners, for the purposes of results, rankings or racing on the Zwift platform, including with CVR World Cup Rankings and WTRL team time trial. We may also share some personal data and statistical information for the purposes of improving our race results and other related services. When you share information in this way, your information may be publicly available.
We may also share your personal data with the following categories of recipients?
With vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf, such as for payment processing, third party payment providers, providing customer service, sending marketing communications, fulfilling subscription services, fulfilling orders and delivering packages, reviewing Chat Information via third parties to ensure it complies with our terms of service, conducting research and analysis, providing cloud computing infrastructure and other technology that helps us offer our Services and carry out our business, and other business functions;
In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Zwift or others; and
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
How We Keep Your Personal Data Secure
We implement and maintain reasonable security appropriate to the nature of the personal data that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. However, there is no perfect security, and reasonable security is a process that involves risk management rather than risk elimination. While we are committed to maintaining a reasonable information security program, no such program can be perfect; in other words, all risk cannot reasonably be eliminated. Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to factors that cannot reasonably be prevented. Accordingly, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.
Retention of Your Personal Data
We generally retain the categories of personal data we collect for the length of time necessary to provide our Services and to comply with legal obligations or to protect our legal rights.
We retain your personal data, including information about your use of the Services until you delete your account with us or where we are otherwise required to retain the data to fulfil our legal obligations. We will delete Account Registration Information, Financial Information and Device Information and de-identify Workout Information within 30 days of receipt of your deletion request.
Cookies and similar technologies
[Please see our Cookies Policy for further information about how we use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other similar tracking technologies]
International Transfers of Your Personal Data
We may transfer your personal data to our affiliates and other third parties located in countries other than where you are located, including in the U.S. where Zwift, Inc. is located and the websites and apps are hosted. Such transfers will be made in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by putting in place appropriate safeguards where required or appropriate.
