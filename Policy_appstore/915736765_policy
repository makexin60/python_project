INSIGHTS FROM THE INSIDE
Rui Fernandes, Head of Markets Structuring
"We began incorporating natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into some of our indices, particularly those investing in single stocks within the thematic index space. This product has been very successful. However, the key takeaway is that innovation must be continuous."
INSIGHTS FROM THE INSIDE
Asif Mohamed, Head of Digital Product for Research
"We offer a portfolio of products that leverage natural language processing technology to analyze large volumes of data and generate insightful signals for clients. These products examine themes and sentiment across a wide range of sources."
INSIGHTS FROM THE INSIDE
Patrick Whelan, Global Head of Fixed Income and Digital Markets
"All the data analytics in the world won't be fully useful to clients if they're based solely on our data set. Clients want real-time streams, pre-trade data, and our analytics, but they also need aggregate data from other providers."
INSIGHTS FROM THE INSIDE
Vietta Grinberg, Head of Sales Product - Digital Markets
"...collaborating with our colleagues in electronic trading teams to automate the pricing process as much as possible. This enables us to spend more time engaging with our clients, understanding their needs, and driving the business forward."
