Terms of use
Responsibilities
Using the APP is entirely the user's responsibility. The author of the APP cannot be held responsible for anything related to the use of the APP.
VIP Access
The lifetime licence gives the user a VIP access for life. Should the user replace or erase the device on which he uses the APP, the licence - and consequently the VIP access - can be restored using the ad-hoc button.
The periodic subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled in user's iTunes/Apple account at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. The subscription cannot be cancelled for the current period once activated. The auto-renewal can be turned off at anytime in user's iTunes account, without removing user's VIP access to the APP until the end of the on-going period. Should the user replace or erase the device on which he uses the APP, the subscription - and consequently the VIP access - can be restored if still within the subscription valid timeframe.
