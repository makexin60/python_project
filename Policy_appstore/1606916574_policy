Last updated: July 2024
Introduction
Here at Onsi, a trading name of Collective Group Holdings Ltd, Collective Society Ltd, Collective Benefits Ltd,
      Collective Netherlands BV and Collective Denmark ApS (Onsi Denmark ApS) (they're our fancy official legal names
      and more simply "we" or "us" and where required, "Onsi", "onsi.com" also meaning the websites and applications
      www.onsi.com, app.onsi.com, our native mobile application and partners.onsi.com and referred to as the "Sites"),
      we take your privacy seriously.
We are committed to protecting the privacy of any personal data we collect, organise, structure, share, use, or
      otherwise process about you, complying with all relevant and applicable data protection legislation, in particular
      the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") in respect of our EU-based activities and the UK
      Data Protection Laws (namely the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018) in respect of our UK activities, and
      only using your personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. That's very important to us.
Depending on where you reside and from where you are using our services, there may be different data protection
      laws that apply when we use your personal data and/or certain rights may not apply in certain jurisdictions.
      Therefore, we have indicated throughout this Privacy Policy, as applicable, if certain information will not apply
      in particular jurisdictions. Additional jurisdiction-specific information relating to Australia, Israel and
      Singapore can be found in the addendums at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy along with any additional terms of use, terms of business and/or end-user licence agreement
      ("EULA") apply to your use of the Sites.
Please grab a cup of coffee or tea (and perhaps a biscuit if you're peckish) and take the time to read this
      Privacy Policy, as it is important for you to understand how we collect and use your data when you use our
      website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and store your personal data, including any which you
      provide to us. We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and you can see the last time it was update at the
      top of this policy.
Throughout this Privacy Policy we use the following terms:
"Customer" and "Customers" to refer to on-demand platforms and other platforms, businesses and communities that
        work with and support flexible workers and to whom we have arranged the insurance policy for and/or have a
        contract with.
"Beneficiary" to refer to flexible workers who are covered by an insurance policy we have arranged for them,
        placed for a Customer and / or who are required to accept (i) our terms of use, (ii) our terms of business and
        (iii) in the UK our membership club rules.
"Partner" or "Partners" to refer to insurance intermediary, insurers, banking institutions and payment
        processors and third-party suppliers.
"Website User" or "Website Users" to refer to visitors to our Sites.
Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms of a contract we have with you and that personal
      data is not provided when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter
      into with you. In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you
      if this is the case. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep
      us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us through the details set out in the 'Get in
      touch' section below.

      name, email address, or other digital identifiers relating to you such as cookies, IP addresses or logs (think of
      it a little like bringing the classic board game 'Guess Who' into the 21st Century).

      as follows:

      part of this offering. Please review any Third Parties' privacy policy which will be provided to you to understand
      how they process your personal data.
We also aggregate and anonymise your personal data to form statistical or demographic data ('Aggregated Data').
      For example, we may aggregate your Usage data (where you are a Website User) to calculate the percentage of users
      accessing a specific website or platform feature. Such aggregated and anonymised data is not Personal Data and
      does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your
      Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data
      which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How do we collect your Personal Data?
We collect Personal Data about you when you access our Sites, register as a Beneficiary with us either directly or
      via one of our Customers, sign up to our membership club, sign up to our rewards card, sign up to a benefits
      package, contact us, send us feedback, post material to one of our platforms or interact with us through the Sites
      over the telephone, or face to face.
We collect this Personal Data from you either directly, such as when you register with us, or contact us, and
      indirectly, such as your browsing activity while on the Sites (see 'Cookies' below).
We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
Direct interactions.
You may give us your identity and contact information by filling in forms
        or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when
        you:
create an account;
apply for our products or services;

request marketing to be sent to you; and

        collect telematics and gyroscope data from your device when you use the Halo's crash detection feature. We
        collect this personal data:
using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive technical data about you if
            you visit other websites employing our cookies. Please see our
cookie policy
for further details; and
Third parties or publicly available sources.
We receive personal data about you from various
      other third parties and public sources as set out below:
our Customers (where you are an individual working for one of our Customers or a Beneficiary);
Partners who might introduce customers to us such as another insurance intermediary and/or insurers;
technical data from analytics providers such as Google based outside the UK; and
identity and contact data from publicly available sources such as credit reference agencies, or customer due
          diligence providers, or Companies House where you are a Partner or Beneficiary.
And how do we use your Personal Data?
We have set out below descriptions of the ways we use your Personal Data and under applicable data protection
      laws, we must have a 'lawful basis' to do so. We have set out below different ways we use your Personal Data and
      our lawful basis for doing so:
where we need to use your Personal Data to enter into or perform our contract with you, for example, in order to
        fulfil our obligations under the agreement we have in place with you. In respect of our motor insurance product
        in the UK, we will process your Personal Data because it is necessary to enter into or perform our contract with
        you i.e., to check your eligibility;
where we have a legitimate business interest to use your Personal Data. A legitimate interest is when we have a
        business or commercial reason to use your information which, when balanced against your rights, is justifiable
        such as maintaining our business records, ensuring the security of our systems and analysing and improving our
        business model and products. In all such cases, we will always consider your interests and undertake a balancing
        exercise to ensure that our business interest does not cause you harm or override your own interest;
where we need to process your data for compliance with our legal and/or regulatory obligations such as
        compliance with data protection laws; or
in limited circumstances where we have your consent.
When the information that we process is classed as a special category data, we must have one of the following
      additional legal grounds for such processing:
it is necessary for an insurance purpose and it is in the substantial public interest. This will apply where we
        are advising or arranging an insurance policy, assisting with your claims as a Beneficiary under a policy, and
        undertaking any activities to prevent and detect fraud. Please note that this lawful ground will only apply to
        our UK operations;
you have provided your consent. There may be some circumstances that without your consent to use your special
        categories of information we would be unable to arrange your insurance cover. We will notify you when this will
        be applicable and why your consent is necessary; or
where the use of your special category data is necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal claims, for
        example legal proceedings have been brought against us or we want to bring a legal claim ourselves.
We may process your Personal Data in reliance of more than one lawful basis depending on the specific purpose for
      which we are using your Personal Data. If you want to know exactly which lawful basis we're relying on (where more
      than one lawful basis is set out in the table), please get in touch.
Please note that this table is generally applicable to all UK and EU jurisdictions except where otherwise stated.

        or to make a claim.
With payment providers, where this is done through an API to our payment providers websites where you are a
        Beneficiary.
When we are required to do so to comply with a contractual obligation or legal requirement or with the
        directions of the courts or other authorities.
To prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests.
Where it is needed to help our trusted third-party services to provide and improve our services to you. We
        contractually require these service providers to keep your Personal Data safe and secure and to treat it in

Marketing and Opting Out
As we've said above, we will only send you information which we think you will be interested in or which you may

Now we have your Personal Data, how do we look after it?
We have put in place security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or
      accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. These measures include using bank-grade encryption to
      protect your data when we store it and we ensure that, if we are sending it across the internet, it is encrypted.
      We also limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who
      have a business need to access it.
Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password
      confidential. Please do not share your password with anyone.
And how long do we keep your data for?
We have a retention policy which sets out how long we keep information for. We only keep your personal information
      for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and to comply with our
      legal and regulatory obligations
The exact period will depend on your relationship with us and the type of Personal Data we hold and process, for
      example:
As a Beneficiary, we keep Personal Data from your insurance claims as well as from fraud detection in accordance
        with the applicable statute of limitation in order to document our performance towards our Partners and
        Customers.
In the UK, we keep certain data, such as information to an insurance contract we have placed, and complaints, on
        record for seven years to ensure we meet the FCA's (our UK's regulator) requirements.
In Spain, in compliance with legal requirements, before fully erasing your Personal Data we will keep it duly
        blocked for the statute of limitations of potential claims that may arise as a consequence of its processing.
        Once said period has elapsed, we will fully erase your Personal Data.
In Austria, we will erase special category data immediately as soon as it is no longer kept for a legally
        permissible purpose.
Personal Data about your use of the website will be deleted at the latest, in accordance with our cookie policy.
        You can read more by clicking

.
If you have signed up for our newsletters or other marketing material, like prize draws, we will keep your
        Personal Data for as long as you wish to receive this material from us. We retain documentation on your consent
        in accordance with the applicable statute of limitation.
Any feedback or survey responses you provide will be anonymised after a period of 3 months.
We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there
      is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
How do we protect your Personal Data when sending it outside the UK and/or Europe?
Countries outside the UK and/or the European Economic Area (which means all the European Union (EU) countries plus
      Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, together "EEA") may have a lower standard of protection for Personal Data than
      that required by UK and/or EEA data protection laws. The information we collect from you may be transferred to and
      stored outside the UK and/or EEA (including for example the United States of America) and will also be processed
      by people operating outside the UK and/or EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers.
If we need to transfer your data to a company based outside the UK and/or EEA (e.g. to provide technology for
      email, subscription and payment support), we will take steps to make sure your personal data is handled in line
      with UK and/or European data protection law by implementing appropriate safeguards, such as entering into the UK's
      International Data Transfer Agreement (for transfers of personal data from the UK) or the approved EU Standard
      Contractual Clauses (for transfers of personal data from the EEA). If you would like any more detail on the
      specific mechanism used by us to transfer your Personal Data outside the UK and/or EEA, please get in contact with
      us through the details set out in the 'Get in touch' section below.
