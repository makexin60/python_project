You can also choose to log in or register with the App via your account on a third party website (such as Facebook or Google). Where you choose to do this, you will be transferred to the third party website, where you can provide your account details and consent to relevant permissions.

2. To procure and manage journeysyou request through the App.
We will need to process information about you in order to arrange and manage the journeys that you order through the App (whether you travel by taxi, private hire vehicle, e-scooter, e-bike or another mode of transport).
This includes allowing you to interact with maps using Google Maps (which is integrated into the App) so that you can pin the pick-up and drop off locations for your journey on the map or (where you have chosen to activate GPS settings) to identify your location via GPS. We  use Google Maps in order to calculate the anticipated cost of your journey and to interactively show you the distance to the vehicle which will be carrying out your journey.
Where you choose to hire an e-scooter, e-moped or rent a car (depending on legal requirements), we will need to verify your driver's licence. You will only be able to hire once the verification is complete. Verification is valid for 36 months, after which point we will ask you to re-verify before you carry out any more hires.
After you have procured a journey, your driver may phone you about your journey (for example, to inform you about delays or ask your to clarify the pick-up location) – however, we use a phone masking service that means the driver will not be able to see your phone number at any time.

5. To manage ratings of our drivers and passengers

On the App, you can provide ratings of drivers and vehicles used to provide your journey: your rating will be aggregated with ratings from other passengers and used to display the driver's average rating on the App. FREE NOW will be able to view your rating (from one to five stars) as well as the specific journey to which the rating is associated. However, your specific rating will not be shown to the driver you have rated and your associated journey details and individual rating will not be shown publicly via the App.
In addition, your driver can provide a rating for you as a passenger (for instance, to provide positive feedback or to inform us of problems). FREE NOW will use these ratings to create an average passenger rating score for you. Only you will be able to view this in your FREE NOW passenger profile. Your rating will not be displayed to drivers during the procurement of any journeys and your rating will not be used as the basis for any journey procurement or other decision about you. We urge our drivers to choose the passenger rating on the basis of the politeness and behaviour of the passenger.

6. To manage fraud prevention and non-payment risks.
When you create an account with the App, FREE NOW will evaluate the risk of non-payment and/or fraud for each new means of payment linked with your account and for each booked journey. We do this using either of the following two methods in order to make a decision about whether or not you will be able to access the "Pay By App" functionality:
our specially-trained employees review your information for irregularities and determine, based on their experience and discretion, whether or not you will be offered the Pay By App functionality. If one of our employees decides that you should not be offered the Pay By App functionality because, for example, they have identified a risk of fraudulent activity, they may contact your driver during your journey to let the driver know that your Pay By App functionality should not be accepted; and
using an automated decision-making process carried out by our European fraud prevention service provider. The provider will calculate a statistical likelihood of non-payment based on information connected with your account and the relevant payment method (and they will not use your personal data for any other purpose). On the basis of this, we will generate a fully automated decision as to whether you will be offered the "Pay By App" function in the App.
If the outcome of our review is that you cannot use the Pay By App functionality then you will be notified of this by e-mail. You will still be able to use the App to procure journeys and pay by other means (such as cash). If you wish to contest a decision that you will not be offered Pay By App, please contact us via
https://support.free-now.com/hc/requests/new
. You will also be able to contest a decision that has been made by fully-automated means. One of our trained employees will then review and reconsider the decision, taking your viewpoint into account when doing so.
We also carry out fraud prevention checks for your journey by using your profile picture (where you have uploaded one) to identify you. The driver who carries out your journey will temporarily be shown your profile picture to check that it matches the passenger taking the journey.
In addition, we carry out checks of the activity on users of our App to prevent ad-related fraud activity.

6. How we transfer your data internationally
6. How we transfer your data internationally
In some cases, your personal information is transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, our group companies are located inside the UK/EEA and we store all our data with a cloud service provider within the EU or in IT infrastructures and systems (employee computers) at our sites within the EEA/UK. Our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. We have selected our service providers carefully to check that they will protect the personal data we share with them and we have engaged them in writing.
Where we transfer your personal data outside the UK or EU/EEA, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. This includes:
relying on the adequacy decisions in relation to transferring personal to third parties in other jurisdictions that have been deemed by the European Commission or the Information Commissioner in the UK to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data;
entering into Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data that have been approved by the European Commission of the UK’s Information Commissioner where appropriate. We have entered into "controller-to-processor" clauses with our service providers and "controller-to-controller" clauses with any parties that act as a joint or independent controller.
For more information on the appropriate safeguards that we have implemented, you can contact us using the details provided in section 1. We do not sell any personal data to third parties.

8. How we keep your personal data secure
We have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to keep your personal data secure (in particular to protect your personal data against unauthorised access by third parties, as well as accidental or intentional modification, loss or destruction). We review these measures periodically and change them in line with state of the art security processes.
The transfer of your personal data from your device (e.g. smartphone) to us is always encrypted. FREE NOW is PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) certified.
9. How long we retain your data
9. How long we retain your data
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or it to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). In particular:
Call recordings are deleted after 90 days;
Inactive accounts are deleted after 3 years of inactivity.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

10. Updates and changes to this Privacy Notice
We may modify this Privacy Notice from time to time in the future in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations or in response to changing technical or legal developments. When we update our Privacy Notice, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.
