This California Privacy Statement (“California Statement”) supplements the Privacy Statement and applies solely to visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”). We adopted this California Statement to comply with California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”). Any terms defined in the CCPA and not defined here have the same meaning when used in this California Statement.

In addition, we may collect data that is not identifiable to you or otherwise associated with you, such as aggregated data, and is not personal information. To the extent this data is stored or associated with personal information, it will be treated as personal information; otherwise, the data is not subject to this California Statement.

Sensitive personal information, such as precise geolocation data.
We will not collect additional categories of personal information other than those categories listed above. If we intend to collect additional categories of personal information, we will provide you with a new notice at or before the time of collection.

2) Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine the Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once per year per person, must be sent to the email address below, and are free of charge.
We do not disclose personal information protected under the “Shine the Light” law to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
In addition, the CCPA provides California residents with the following rights:
Right to Know:
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about the personal information we collected, used, disclosed, shared and sold about you in the past 12 months. This includes a request to know any or all of the following:

Please note that if you request deletion of your personal information, we may deny your request or may retain certain elements of your personal information if it is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between our business and you.

To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Otherwise use the personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.

Privacy Statement,

3) Submitting a Verified Consumer Request
To exercise your Right to Know, Data Portability, and Right to Delete, you must provide us with sufficient information to allow us to verify your identity, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Once we receive the information you provide to us, we will review it and determine if more information is necessary to verify your identity as required by law, and we may request additional information in order to do so.
To exercise your California privacy rights described above, please submit a verifiable request to us by:
Visiting our
Data Request Form
Calling us at 1-844-730-1450
Visiting us in-person at our California retail location
Only you, or a person authorized by you to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for Right to Know or Data Portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. Given the sensitivity of your personal information that we collect and retain, we will need to verify your identity with at least 2 pieces of information, such as Name, Address or Customer Email.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We may deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity or have reason to believe that the request is fraudulent.
Consumer Request by an Authorized Agent
If any authorized agent submits a consumer request on your behalf, in order to confirm that person or entity’s authority to act on your behalf and verify the authorized agent’s identity, we require a verifiable request be submitted using our
Data Request Form
, along with the below items:
To verify your authorization to request on behalf of a California resident, provide one or more of the following: (1) California Secretary of State authorization, (2) written permission from the California resident, or (3) power of attorney.
To verify your identity, provide evidence of your identity.
To verify the identity of the California resident for whom the request is being made, provide the information set forth above for the verification of the consumer request.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require to create an account with us. However, if you do have an existing login, we will require you to log in to submit a request. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the request’s identity or authority to make the request.
We will acknowledge receipt of the request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability requests, we will provide the responsive information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Do Not Track
We use analytics systems and providers and participate in ad networks that process personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services. We do not currently process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites.
Note, however, that you may find information about how to opt out of Google Analytics and/or block or reject certain tracking technologies in our
Cookie Policy
.
4) Notice of Financial Incentives
From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive and/or price or service difference to our customers
related to the collection of personal information. This Notice of Financial Incentive(s) explains the financial incentives or price or service differences that we may offer, so that you can make an informed decision on whether you would like to participate.
Customers who sign up for our emails may receive a coupon code on their next purchase. You can opt-in
to receive this code by providing your email address and/or phone number. You have the right to
withdraw your consent to participate at any time and can do so by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link at
the bottom of our marketing communications.
Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal information. However, in the event we
are required by law to assign such value in the context of financial incentives or price or service differences that we offer, we have valued the Personal Information collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount code or financial incentive offered, and the calculation of the value is based upon a reasonable and good-faith estimate often involving the consideration of (i) the categories of
Personal information collected (e.g., email addresses and phone numbers), (ii) the value of the discount offered, and (iii) the value of the total purchase (excluding taxes and fees). The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.
5) Modifications and Updates to this California Statement
We reserve the right, at any time, to modify, alter, and/or update this California Statement, and any such modifications, alterations, or updates will be effective upon our posting of the revised California Statement. Your continued use of the Services following our posting of any revised California Statement will constitute your acknowledgement of the amended California Statement.
