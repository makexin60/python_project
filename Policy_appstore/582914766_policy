Such action may include without limitation:
(a)
Removing such reviews or other comments made anywhere on the Website as Rankers acting at its sole discretion deems appropriate;

Ranking Score Percentage::
You acknowledge and agree that in determining the ranking score percentages that appear on the Website that, subject at all times to the provisions of clause 7, Rankers applies as its sees appropriate the following considerations in determining a ranking score percentage:
(a)
A ranking score percentage may include adjustments for credibility and relevancy;
(b)
The average (mean) of all the customer reviews is the primary factor for determining a ranking score percentage;
(c)
Fresh reviews are more relevant and as such carry a greater weight in determining a final ranking score percentage; and
(d)
A reasonable number of rankings is necessary in order for a ranking score percentage to be credible. A ranking score percentage will be moderated where there are only a few reviews, provided further that you also acknowledge and agree that a ranking score percentage is used to sort experiences in ranking tables and is not necessarily a direct measurement of the quality of a particular experience as rated by its customers; and experiences with a decent number of recent and high-rating reviews will tend to sit higher in the ranking tables.
