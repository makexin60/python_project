What our Clients say about us
Modify the existing invite plugin and develop buttons that send a custom notification to the person who invited them.
Satguru Technologies did what I asked them, and more! I'm very happy about their work and will be contacting them in the future for more work. I recommend Satguru Technologies to anyone who needs quality work done.
Building Online Questionnaire
I think the greatest takeaway from this project is that my knowledge of web-based applications is far far greater than what it was prior to the solution Satguru Technologies provided me (I knew nothing about online questionnaires, etc.). I cannot fault the level of patience and willingness Satguru technologies provided to help me understand where the project could perform better than my original expectations. The result is easy to use, looks great, and will most certainly add to my business.
Website/app Conditional Calculator
Satguru Technologies did a fantastic job on my project. They were able to create exactly what I was looking for with little guidance. The finished item is exactly what I had envisaged and I will definitely hire them for future projects.
PHP/MySQL scripting for an online application
I found Satguru technologies to be engaging from the onset. Their team followed my requirements as documented. I was able to review progress with a day of initiation followed by a daily update on code release and open issues/questions. Even though I would have been happy with a bare-bones front end, their team added some quick inexpensive touches to make the front end more polished.
Website Design
Satguru Technologies has a team of professional designers who deliver the project on time and always go beyond expectations. I would 100% consider working with them again.
Build me a Website - for Small Business
Great communication, and delivered changes in a timely manner. Really happy with the quality of their work, and what they delivered. We revised a few times of the look and feel of the website and they took initiative to have input in areas I was not sure about. The team was supportive throughout the whole process, and would highly recommend it!
Build Bootstrap CSS style from brand guidelines
Great communication to clarify project reqs and delivered exactly what they said they would.
Project for Satguru Technologies.
Work is done, great company but they have been too busy to take my new projects. You should be charging more $$ my friend! Been using them for years now! They have done 2 websites and maintenance for a year now.
