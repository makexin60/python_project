When you register for, access, or use the Service, we collect certain personal information, including a unique username and password.
We may also collect and use any other information that you may provide while accessing or using the Service or communicating directly with us, whether through the Site, Service, electronic communications or other channels.

Information Collected by Automated Means
Whenever you use the Site or Service, we and/or our service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect information about how the Site and Service is accessed and used (

Usage Information helps us to keep the Site user friendly and to provide visitors with readily accessible and helpful information. We may also use your Usage Information to troubleshoot issues with access or use of our Site and to improve the Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

’
s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.

By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to anywhere
in the U.S. where the Service or our service providers maintain facilities and the use and
disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
Our goal is to not hold or use your information longer than necessary for the purposes that we collect and use data.
How long we hold your personal data for will vary. The retention period will be determined by
various criteria including:
•
the purpose for which we are using it – we will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and
•
legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your personal data.
Personal Information you submit on the Site or through the Service may be sent to the other countries, on our service providers
’

We are a US based company and by accessing the Site, you grant us expressed consent to transfer your Personal Information to US servers. If you do not wish for us to transfer your Personal Information to the US, please contact us using the information in the

This section sets out the privacy principles we follow with respect to transfers of Personal Information from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States, including Personal Information we receive from individuals residing in the EEA who visits our Websites and/or who may use of our Services or otherwise interact with us.
Please note that for users located in the EEA, the term Personal Information used in this privacy is equivalent to the term
“

V.
What Steps Do We Take to Protect Your Information?
We take measures designed to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information we process and maintain. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other types of misuse. To protect the confidentiality of Personal Information maintained in your account, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site and Service by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us might have been compromised, or if you suspect that someone else is using your account, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided below in the
“
Contact Us” Section.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information. To the extent the law of your jurisdiction allows for notification of a breach via e-mail or conspicuous posting on the Services, you agree to accept notice in that form.
VI.
Payment Information
We do not collect, store, or otherwise maintain any credit card information through the Site.
If the Site or Service collect any payments, the information collected to facilitate the transaction, including information associated with your credit card, will be processed by a third-party payment processor, such as Stripe.
All of our service providers processing payments will utilize a secure tokenization method to capture and process credit card transactions through the Site and Service.  Your payment information, including any
credit card information does not pass through our servers and is not saved in any of our systems.  None or our employees, contractors, or other users of the Site have access to your payment information.
If payment information is used to facilitate a transaction through the Service, our payment processor returns a secure token to us that we can store and use for future transactions.  We store this token for your convenience so that you are not required to re-enter payment information for each transaction.  This token can be deleted and removed from our system upon your request.
Simply use the functionality provided on the Site or contact us below using the information provided in the
“
Contact Us” section.

’

Shine the Light
For clarity, we will not trade, rent, share, or sell your Personal Information to third parties unless you ask or authorize us to do so. However, if we disclose Personal Information that is primarily used for personal, family, or household purposes of a California user to a third party for said third party

Do-Not-Track
Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what
“
Do Not Track” means, how compliance with
“
Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a
“
Do Not Track” signal. We have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law. In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking. See Section
“
Your Access to and Control Over Your Information”.
