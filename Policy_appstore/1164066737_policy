Appendix 1 – PRC’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)
Where the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China ('PIPL') is applicable to you and/or our process of your personal information, the following information in Appendix 1 shall apply as a supplement to the above App Privacy Notice and our Data Privacy Notice.
Minor’s information
For protection of minors’ personal information, our products and services are not specifically targeting minors under 14 years old ('Minors'), and we have no intention to collect any Minors’ personal information, unless it is agreed by their parents or guardians and it is necessary for the purposes set out in accordance to our Data Privacy Notice. If you are under the age of 18, you shall ensure that your parents or guardians have carefully read this App Privacy Notice, and have given all necessary consents on the provision of your personal information to us. Please kindly note that if we discover that you are a Minor and we have not obtained your parent/guardian’s consent when providing us with your personal information, we would immediately cease to provide you with any products or services. Meanwhile, it is suggested that your use of our products and services should be under the guidance of your parents or guardians. If they do not agree for you to provide your personal information or to use any of our products or services, you should immediately stop providing the information or stop using our products and services. Please notify us of such an event as soon as possible, so as to allow us to take appropriate measures accordingly. We will only use or disclose such information to the extent set out in accordance with our Data Privacy Notice.  If you are under the age of 18 (including children under the age of 14), for those personal information we collect with the consent of your parents or guardians, we will only use or disclose such information to the extent allowed by law and regulation or expressly consented by your parents or guardians.
If you are the parent or guardian of a Minor, please read these terms carefully and confirm whether you agree that the Minor can use our services and/or provide personal information to us. You shall confirm that your child uses our services and provides his/her personal information to us with your consent and provide evidence of parental/guardian relationship to us upon our request when necessary.
Withdrawal of PIPL consents
You can choose to withdraw some or all of the consents under the PRC's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) at any time by contacting us through HSBC HK App > Support > Chat with us or our hotline. If you cancel the authorization, we will no longer continue to collect your personal information concerned, nor will we be able to provide you with products and services that necessarily require such personal information. Please kindly note that your decision to withdraw your consent will not affect any collection of personal information based on your consent prior to such withdrawal, nor any other legal personal information processing activities that do not need your consent or mandated by applicable laws and regulations.

Sub-section Policy: 
Sub-policy 0
https://www.hsbc.com.hk/misc/privacy-security/:
Privacy and Security
We build our business on trust between our customers and us. We understand that your data is important. Please see below our privacy notice which explains how we collect, store, use and share your data.
Security
Security is a top priority for us. Both you and we play an important role in safeguarding against fraud. This section outlines what you need to do and what we will do to help maintain security when using this site/app.
What we will do
We try to protect your personal data against unauthorised or accidental access or processing.
We do this by:
implementing appropriate physical, electronic and internal processes to safeguard and secure your personal data,
using 128-bit Transport Layer Security ("TLS") encryption technology, which is an industry standard for encryption over the internet to protect data, in the secure area of this site/app. When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the internet,
protecting our web servers behind "firewalls" and our systems are monitored to try to prevent any unauthorised access,
using the secure email facility if we need to send personal data to you by email. We won’t send your personal data by ordinary email,
taking all practical steps to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary and we comply with all laws and regulations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region concerning the retention of personal data.
What you need to do
Keep your account details and security details secure
.
This means taking steps like:
not sharing or allowing anyone else to know your username or password, so don’t write them down. We’ll never verbally ask you for your password,
choosing a username and password that are not easily identifiable by others (such as your birthday, telephone number or email address),
using the secure email facility on this app/website for general enquiries.
Keep your device on which you access the site/app secure.
This means taking steps like:
keeping your device locked when not in use, with a PIN, password or biometric authentication,
not sharing your device. If you do allow someone else to use your device, please supervise their use to ensure that they don’t access your accounts,
not sharing or allowing anyone else to know any access password that you use on your device,
if you choose to activate the feature that allows you to use your biometric credentials to log onto your device or this app, ensuring that only your biometric credentials are registered on the device to avoid unauthorised access by other people,
only downloading HSBC apps and its updates from an official app store and not from any unofficial sources,
installing the latest anti-virus and anti-spyware software on your device that you use to access this site/app, and keeping it updated. When installing protection, always use a reputable brand from a mainstream supplier,
ensuring the operating system running on your device and the security update is up to date,
not disclosing your online banking credentials to any third parties (including third party mobile aggregator apps),
not using HSBC apps and the Mobile Security Key Feature on any device or operating system that has been modified outside the mobile device or operating system vendor supported or warranted configurations. This includes devices that have been "jail-broken" or "rooted". A jail broken or rooted device means one that has been freed from the limitations imposed on it by your mobile service provider and the phone manufacturer without their approval. The use of HSBC apps and the Mobile Security Key feature on a jail broken or rooted device may compromise security and lead to fraudulent transactions which we may not be responsible for.
If you think that your device has been lost, stolen or is being used by another person or if you think your username or password is known by someone else, please tell us straight away. You may be responsible for unauthorised payments made from your accounts if you have not kept your device, account details or security details safe or if you haven’t followed the security precautions that we advise you to follow from time to time.

Cookies and your privacy
The information cookies collect, and how we use that information, may count as personal data. We may also be able to identify you by name, IP address or session ID. You have rights regarding how we collect, store and use your personal data.
You can learn more about how we use your personal data in our Privacy Notice section below.
Use of Big Data & Artificial Intelligence ("BDAI")
Big data technologies and artificial intelligence (“BDAI”) enable companies to process and analyse a depth and breadth of data which has never been possible before. At HSBC, we are using big data and AI to, for example:
Bring benefits to our customers, for example, by improving customer service
Manage risks for ourselves and our customers
Better identify and offer relevant products and services to customers
Improve operational efficiencies.
Using these new technologies and opportunities come with new responsibilities: we must ensure that big data and AI are used ethically. That is why we have a set of principles to help us consider and address the ethical issues that may arise.
You can find our Principles for the Ethical Use of Data and Artificial Intelligence in https://www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/our-conduct.
HSBC’s Privacy Principles
We build our business on trust between our customers and ourselves. To preserve the privacy of personal data you provide to us, we follow the following privacy principles:
Transparency: We are clear and transparent about how we collect and use personal data, including providing data subjects with a statement of how we may use their data where required.
Fair and lawful usage: We only collect, process and store personal data lawfully and where we have a legitimate reason to do so.
Limited purposes: We only process personal data for specified purposes, and will not use it for another incompatible purpose without first taking any steps required by applicable data privacy laws to enable us to do so lawfully.
Data minimisation and adequacy: We ensure our collection, retention and processing of personal data is proportionate. We will strike an appropriate balance to ensure that we process sufficient data to carry on our business and achieve any specified lawful purposes, while making sure that we do not collect, retain or process excessive amounts of data.
Data quality and accuracy: We maintain appropriate standards of data quality and integrity, and we implement policies in respect of data accuracy, including taking steps to avoid personal data becoming out of date where appropriate.
Privacy by Design: We ensure that new products and services, or changes to existing products or services, are designed to respect data privacy law. We make sure every individual who works with personal data is aware of their legal obligations and their responsibility to follow these principles.
Data security and retention: We retain personal data securely, implement appropriate data retention policies, and we dispose of personal data securely once it is no longer required. We ensure that only persons who are permitted to access your personal data are allowed to do so.
Training and awareness: We ensure that those acting on our behalf with access to personal data are trained appropriately on their obligations regarding such data.
Data subject rights: We respect individuals’ rights in respect of their personal data.
Third parties: Where we appoint a vendor or agent to process personal data, we require them to process the data in a manner consistent with these principles. We only disclose data to governmental or judicial bodies or law enforcement or agencies or our regulators where this is allowed by applicable data privacy laws, or where required by other laws and regulations.
Data transfers: Where we voluntarily transfer personal data to another HSBC Group entity, third party or to another jurisdiction, we ensure that the transfer is lawful and that the recipient is required to process the data in a manner consistent with these principles.
By maintaining our commitment to these principles, we will ensure that we respect the inherent trust that you place in us.

E
Your Credit Information
If you apply for, have, or have had, a loan including a home loan
We'll perform credit checks on you which may involve us providing your loan data to credit reference agencies (CRAs) (including the operator of any centralised database used by CRAs), and in the event of default, to debt collection agencies.  The CRAs will add this data to their database and any centralised database used by them, which is available to other credit providers to help them assess whether to provide you with credit.  The CRAs will keep your data. You can request that we ask the CRAs to delete it once you've fully repaid your loan.  They will only do this if:
none of your payments were more than 60 days overdue in the 5 years before you fully repaid your loan. If they were, the CRAs will keep your data for 5 years from the date you fully paid that missed payment
you’re not declared bankrupt with an amount under your loan being written off. If you are, the CRAs will delete that record after 5 years from the date you’re discharged from bankruptcy (you must tell them when this happens) or 5 years from the date you fully repay the overdue loan amount
If you have a home loan, we’ll ask for your consent to share previous home loan data with CRAs.
This notice will apply for as long as we store your data. We’ll send you the latest version at least once a year. If we use your data for a new purpose, we’ll get your consent.
