At Type One Style Limited, we may transfer your personal information to locations outside of your country of residence, including to countries that may have different data protection laws than those in your jurisdiction. We want to assure you that any such transfers are conducted with the utmost care and in compliance with applicable data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Legal Basis for International Data Transfers
As explained in this privacy policy, we use services whose providers are partly located in so-called third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) or process personal data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the European Union. Where this is the case and the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we have taken appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses of the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations.
If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyze it, and that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed.
Your Rights and Protections
Your rights and protections regarding the processing and transfer of your personal information remain unaffected by any international data transfers. We are committed to ensuring that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored.
