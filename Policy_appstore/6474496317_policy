Last updated: May 3, 2024
Welcome to AI Art (the “App”), where you can generate AI Arts and swap faces online using our advanced artificial intelligence technology to create fun and unique content (“Services”). We value your privacy and are dedicated to protecting it. Rest assured, we take your privacy seriously and ensure that we neither collect nor use your personal information to provide our services.
By downloading and using this App, you agree to our privacy policy. This policy outlines our commitment to maintaining your privacy by ensuring that no personal information is collected about you.
1.1. Your face images:
You can add your face image for the AI Girl feature. We may save that image for future face swapping. You can remove the faces using the app, and they will be deleted from our server and cannot be accessed again.
1.2. Photos and Videos:
We do not collect photos, gifs, and videos when you upload them from your mobile devices while using the App. The generated photos and videos will be deleted from our server after 1 hour and can only be accessed using your device locally.

We do not collect facial feature data from your photos.

The details include traffic data, logs, and other communication data, as well as the resources that you access and use on or through the App are not collected by the App.
1.5. Device Information:
We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device's unique identifier, operating system, browser type, and usage statistics.
2.1. We do not collect and use your photos or facial features for any reason.
2.2. We use your information, other than photos or facial features, to:
a. Provide you with the App and its contents, as well as any other information, products, or services that you request from us.
b. Notify you when App updates are available, and inform you of any changes to the products or services we offer or provide through it.

3.1. When you use the App, certain third parties may utilize automatic information collection technologies to gather data about you or your device. Third parties that we engage to collect data regarding App users include:
a. Mixpanel (
https://mixpanel.com
), which collects information on the App user behavior.

These third parties may employ tracking technologies to gather information about you while using this App.
3.2. We do not have control over the tracking technologies used by these third parties or how they are utilized. If you have any inquiries regarding advertisements or other targeted content, please reach out to the responsible provider directly.

Your face images will be stored on an AWS server in the Ohio region exclusively during your use of the Services. Storing face images facilitates quick generation of images and face swaps.
4.2. The generated content will be stored in the App document. If you close the App and reopen it after a while, you can access your photos without requiring an internet connection.
4.3. The App utilizes the Replicate API for face swapping. The generated and original photos will not be stored on a replicated server and will be deleted after 1 hour. You can access the privacy policy at

If the volume of requests overwhelms the App or if the request is complex and requires extensive action, this period may be extended by an additional two months. In such cases, the App will notify you of the extension and the reasons for the delay within one month of receiving the request.
If you have concerns about our response, lack of response, or any other issues, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country empowered to address such complaints.

Failure to provide satisfactory proof may result in termination of access to our services.
