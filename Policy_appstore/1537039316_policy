      feature when logging in to the Pilleye. This feature helps members directly access and manage their accounts
      without having to re-enter passwords or go through other user verification when reconnecting to the Pilleye
      service on the device.

      Apple, Facebook accounts, and log in to their user account through the credentials of other third-party platforms.
5. Choice of Members
E-mail and SMS. If you do not wish to receive email or specific communications from Pilleye, simply deselect the
    option 'Set up email reception' in the 'Account' section of the Pilleye to refuse receiving them. Please note that
    service-related communications from Pilleye, such as messages related to account transactions, cannot be denied.

    operating systems, you are automatically registered to receive push notifications. If you no longer wish to receive

Identifier matching communication for PillEye. On some third-party sites and apps, PillEye may transmit a
    privacy-protected identifier to the third party in order to deliver online promotions related to PillEye content and
    services to members. A privacy-protected identifier is a value that PillEye converts the original information (such
    as email address or phone number) to prevent the exposure of the original information. The third party considers it
    a match only if the privacy-protected identifier received matches the identifier in their own database that the
    member used for PillEye and the third-party service (such as email address). If there is a match, PillEye can choose
    whether to deliver specific promotional communication to members using the third-party site or app, optimize the
