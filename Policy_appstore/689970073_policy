Access to your personal data
At any time you may request a copy of your personal data that we hold about you and check that we are lawfully processing it or request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Erasure of your personal data
You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party
You have the right to ask us provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you may withdraw that consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Awin Consumers
How do we use data from end users?
Awin primarily uses end user data for the purpose of tracking an end user from a Publisher to an Advertiser. Tracking enables Awin and ShareASale to see that an end user has visited a publisher's service, found a product/service, and clicked the link to be taken to the advertiser's service to review or purchase the product/service.
The purpose of tracking is to attribute sales and marketing effort by a Publisher to a particular transaction, to enable Advertisers to reward Publishers on a per transaction basis. Tracking also allows Awin to provide Publishers and Advertisers with related reports. The majority of these reports contain only aggregated statistical data.
Awin doesn’t know who the end user is, simply that the same end user started their journey with the Publisher and completed it with the Advertiser and that the affiliate marketing campaign was therefore successful in respect of that end user.
By maintaining a limited user profile which does not reveal an end user’s name or identity, Awin can also understand an end user journey when it starts on one device, and ends on a different device. Through this functionality, Awin can understand whether a referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device. The profile is only used to attribute sales and marketing effort to a Publisher, even if the end user has changed devices before completing a transaction.
Awin permits Publishers to enquire as to whether an action by a user ought to have generated a commission for that Publisher. This necessitates the sharing of information, between Publishers and Advertisers. Advertisers use the information provided by Publishers to verify against their own records. Awin enables this data sharing and the payment of any commission due to the Publisher as a result.
How do we collect data from end users?
The main technologies used for Awin’s tracking are Tracking Domain Cookies, Journey Tags and Device Fingerprinting.
Awin Tracking Domain Cookies
: These are cookies served by Awin’s own domain when an end user clicks on an advertisement displayed by a Publisher. We use this information to understand which end users are referred by which Publishers to which Advertiser. Please find some general information on cookies
here
. Our tracking cookies are listed
here
.
Advertiser Journey Tag
: This is JavaScript code integrated into the Advertiser’s service to enable Awin to receive transactional information from Advertisers. Awin uses this information to record, validate and report the completion of transactions, for the purposes of apportioning commissions to Publishers.
Fingerprinting
: This is a method by which Awin can uniquely identify a device by considering certain attributes of the browser or the device (incl. screen size/resolution and user configurations).
What data do we collect from end users?
We take care to collect only the data that we need. The majority of the data Awin uses is machine generated. It lets us single out a person but it does not reveal who that person is. We do not use this data to make predictions or evaluations of users’ interest or personalities.
Awin is one part of the affiliate marketing ecosystem (see our Agreement with Advertisers and Publishers below) and does not always have absolute control over the personal data that it receives from users, Publishers or Advertisers.
Awin participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Awin’s identification number within the framework is: 907.
Awin stores an individual sequence of figures in respect of a transaction that does not reveal the name of a particular end user and contains information on the Advertiser’s campaign, the Publisher, the end user action (i.e. a click or a view and in which country it occurred), and the device that is used.
Awin also receives limited transactional information via the Journey Tag, to confirm that a transaction has occurred and carry out accurate commission allocating, billing and reporting. Such information includes the order value, whether a voucher has been used, product type, and sales channel.
Awin's data processing activities relating to end user data, do not require the direct identification of an individual and therefore Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in this respect. Pseudonymisation is privacy-enhancing. It is the separation of data from direct identifiers so that data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information. Pseudonymisation, therefore, reduces the risks associated with data processing, while also maintaining the data’s utility.
Does Awin have legitimate interest in using data?
We have carried out a balancing test and have identified legitimate interest as a basis for processing user data for the purposes set out in this section of the Privacy Policy.
When assessing Awin’s reliance on legitimate interest, the interests of the full affiliate ecosystem were considered. A balancing test was carried out and it was confirmed that tracking carries a low risk of undue negative impact on the end user’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Legitimate interests are not limited to the interests of Awin, but can be legitimate interests of a third party or to society as a whole. In the context of our service, we consider that:
Advertisers have an interest in carrying on an online advertising campaign, paid for on a performance basis, whereby third party referrers of customers or potential customers of the Advertiser are compensated for referrals which generate revenue for the Advertiser or which undertake another act desired by the Advertiser.
Publishers have an interest in monetising their content, services or other aspects of the Publisher website by generating advertising revenue which is paid on a performance basis.
Advertisers and publishers have an interest in obtaining reports relevant to their respective business revenue generation.
Awin has an interest in operating an affiliate marketing platform, and to provide technology, services and reporting, in return for payment from Advertisers.
Awin, Advertisers, Publishers and society at large have an interest in preventing fraud, misuse of services, or money laundering.
What is our arrangement with Publishers and Advertisers on our network?
Awin's affiliate marketing network connects Advertisers and Publishers, as well as third-party technology partners in some instances, so that they can work together to run affiliate marketing campaigns.
In running the campaign each party plays their part in pursuing the common purposes and each party can make certain decisions about the way data is used.
Awin contractually requires that participation in its network is compliant with data protection law and that participants each fulfil their obligations to respond to requests to exercise data subject rights. You can approach each party, if you intend to exercise your rights in respect of the data which that party controls.
Awin works with these
Advertisers
. For guidance on how to make a request to a Publisher or an Advertiser, please check their respective privacy notices. For more information of how to make a request to Awin, “What rights do you have in respect of user data” below.
For how long do we keep end user data?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
As a general rule, Awin retains tracking data for 36 months after collection.
What rights do you have in respect of user data?
We will honour your rights under applicable data protection laws. These rights are not absolute and they do not always apply in all cases. If you wish to make a request in respect of your user data, as described in this section of the Privacy Policy, please contact
global-privacy@awin.com
You may:
request access to your personal data and information related to our use and processing of your personal data;
request the correction or deletion of your personal data;
request that we restrict our use of your personal data;
request a machine-readable copy of your personal data or that your personal data be transferred to other IT systems;
object to the processing of your personal data ; and
withdraw your consent to our use of your personal data at any time where we rely on your consent to use or process that personal data.
Please note that, as described under “What data do we collect from users?”, Awin mostly holds what is known as “pseudonymous” data in respect of users. Pseudonymisation means that we may not be in a position to identify the individual behind the data we hold and that we therefore cannot provide them with access, rectification, erasure or data portability without the provision of additional data (for example your IP address, or device ID).
How do we use data to administer our business?
We process personal data for the legitimate interests of ensuring that use of our services is lawful and non-fraudulent, does not disrupt the operation of our services, does not harass our staff or other individuals, and to enforce our legal rights and comply with our legal obligations.
Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any of the applicable laws, we may use your personal data to inform relevant third parties such as your email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content.
With whom do we share your personal data?

Your personal data may be shared to the extent necessary for us to provide our services (i.e. to advertisers and publishers and/or third-party technology partners engaged by those parties).
Group members
, personnel, service providers: We keep your personal data confidential, but disclose it to our group members, our personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the personal data, and have agreed to safeguard it. Activities which are carried out by third party service providers include: CRM management software (Pardot, MailChimp), website hosting, [website analytics] and IT support.
Merger or acquisition
: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email, account message and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding this personal data.
Required by law
: In addition, we disclose your personal data to the extent that we are required to do so by law (e.g. to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).
Enforcement
: We disclose your personal data to third parties in order to enforce or apply the terms of agreements, to investigate potential breaches or to protect the rights, property or safety of Awin, our customers or others.
How do we keep your data safe?
We will take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data.
Please be aware that, although we endeavour to provide security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
Do we transfer data outside of the UK/EEA?
We are established in the
following countries

Definitions used in this Privacy Policy
Throughout this Privacy Policy we use several capitalised terms. You can find the definitions for these
here
.
Privacy commitment and scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“
Privacy Policy
”) describes how Personal Data is collected and used by CJ when providing our Services. We care about your privacy and we want you to understand how we process Personal Data and what choices you have with regards to it. We have taken steps to provide you with this information as clear and easy as possible, but if you have any questions you can always
contact us
.
We believe that data protection is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet and that a great online experience can provide significant benefits to users if done properly. In accordance with these believes, CJ creates results for publishers and advertisers in revolutionary ways without compromising users’ privacy or data protection.
By getting familiar with this Privacy Policy, you have taken the first step in understanding how advertising businesses such as ours help contribute to the Internet’s ability to remain a diverse ecosystem of free content, as well as provide a better digital browsing experience.
What does CJ do?
When a consumer visits websites and mobile applications, there are almost always third parties working behind the scenes to help provide a great digital experience. CJ is one of these companies and we provide the affiliate marketing that keeps your favourite blogs free, your favourite stores in business, and your advertising experience more relevant. Please watch
this video
to learn more about CJ and affiliate marketing.
Affiliate marketing is the process of a publisher (for example a blog or a news site) earning commission by promoting products or services of advertisers (for example a retailer). Publishers will promote products or services from advertisers to visitors of their websites or mobile applications and earn a piece of the profit for each sale generated. CJ operates an
affiliate network
, which helps publishers and advertisers connect with each other. An affiliate network acts as an intermediary between publishers and advertisers to help them find advertising programs which are suitable for their needs and channels, and makes sure the right party is rewarded for an effective referral or marketing effort. To make some of these things possible, and to make smarter decisions, we need to use information that is considered Personal Data.
Cookies and device access
We will only place our own Cookies or otherwise access a consumer’s device directly if we have been provided with consent to do so, as required by the ePrivacy Directive and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). However, certain essential Cookies do not require consent. This includes Cookies that are essential to comply with the GDPR’s security principle as well as Cookies that help ensure that content of a page loads quickly and effectively by distributing the workload across numerous computers.
Examples of situations where essential Cookies are used are when we need to identify a consumer to be able to provide them with loyalty points or cash back. If a consumer has requested loyalty points or cash back from one of our partners, we need to access the consumer's device to create/read a Cookie ID so that we can ensure that the loyalty points or cash back are provided to the correct consumer. In these situations, accessing the device is strictly necessary to provide the consumer with a service they have requested.
What Personal Data do we process?
The majority of the Personal Data CJ processes is machine-generated. We do not collect any Personal Data that directly identifies a consumer. As CJ's data processing activities do not require the direct identification of a consumer, CJ only holds what is known as “Pseudonymised Personal Data”. Pseudonymised Personal Data is Personal Data that cannot be attributed to a specific consumer without the use of additional information. Using Pseudonymised Personal Data can reduce the risks to consumers, while also help companies like CJ meet their data protection obligations.
Using only Pseudonymised Personal Data lets us see and follow a consumer’s journey from a publisher to an advertiser, but without revealing who that consumer is in a traditional sense by using name, address or email. In other words, we cannot directly identify a consumer using the Personal Data that we process. We have no interest in or need to know those details about any particular consumer.
When a consumer visits and interacts with a website or mobile application that participates in our Services the following information might be collected and transferred to us:
·
Browser and device information
. This includes information such as user agent string which provides browser type and version, Cookie ID, click, impressions, time stamp, IP address, referring site URL and current site URL.
·
Transactional Data
. This includes information that described the online purchases and actions made by a consumer, Order ID, order information like products and services and online timestamp.
How Personal Data is used and lawful basis
CJ primarily uses Personal Data for the purpose of attributing a referral or a marketing effort on a publisher website or mobile application to a transaction with an advertiser. We do this to enable advertisers to reward publishers on a per-transaction basis for their marketing efforts. It also allows CJ to provide publishers and advertisers with related reports and analytics. Most of these reports contain only aggregated statistical data.
We do
not
use Personal Data to make predictions or evaluations of a consumer’s interest, and we do
not
use Personal Data to create advertising profiles.
Please see our full purposes and lawful bases below.
Purpose
Lawful basis
To identify consumers, including trying to determine what devices are likely to belong to a consumer and trying to distinguish their device from other devices, so that we are able to provide commission accurately to participants of our Services.
Legitimate interest
Support reporting and analytics to participants of our Services on the transactions made.
Legitimate interest
Improve existing systems and software and to develop new products.
Legitimate interest
Monitor for and prevent fraudulent activity as well as ensuring systems and processes work properly and securely.
Legitimate interest
In support of the purposes above we use Personal Data that we hold to determine whether different devices are likely to belong to the same consumer, and to distinguish their device from other devices based on information the device automatically sends, such as IP address or browser type. This helps us understand whether the same consumer starts a transaction on one device and completes it on another. We do this to make sure we can provide commission to the referring publisher accurately.
CJ’s legitimate interests for the purposes above include: providing our Services; ensuring that participants of our Services (publishers and advertisers) are paying and are being compensated for traffic and transactions generated through our Service; and ensuring participants (publishers and advertisers) are only paying and being compensated for traffic and transactions by a natural person (e.g. not a bot). Further information can be provided upon request.
If a consumer has requested loyalty points or cash back from one of our partners, then we need to process Personal Data for the purposes above so that we are able to provide the consumer with the loyalty points or cash back that they have requested. In those cases, the processing is necessary for performance of the contract that the consumer has with one of our partners regarding loyalty points or cash back.
Who do we share Personal Data with?
We share your Personal Data:
-
With companies within the Publicis Groupe for the purposes above,
-
With participants of our Services (publishers and advertisers) so that they can verify that they have either paid, or have been compensated with, the correct amount,
-
With our processors,
-
Third parties in the event of any reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stocks (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) and
-
As we believe necessary and appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal processes and obligations; (c) to respond to requests from public and governmental authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
How long do we keep Personal Data?
We retain all Personal Data in accordance with our data retention policy which abides by applicable law. The retention period depends on the type of data. For example, we retain Pseudonymised Personal Data for up to six (6) years.
Your rights
We understand that you may be interested to know what Personal Data we hold about you (
access
). You can view this information and even
delete
it if you choose to do so by clicking
here
.
If you wish to exercise any other rights you might under Data Protection Laws (including
rectification
,
portability
and
restriction
), please
c
ontact us
.
In situations when we rely on consent you have the right
to withdraw your consent
at any time. If you have provided CJ with consent to place our own Cookies or otherwise access your device directly, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. You can do so by clicking on “Review Consent Preferences” in the footer of our
website
and follow the instructions.
International transfers
In order to provide our Services, we transfer Personal Data to, and Process Personal Data in, countries outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom. More specifically our servers are located in the United States, and our processors operate around the world including the United States and India.
We have taken appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data will remain protected when transferred outside EU/EEA and the UK. This includes implementing Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Data adopted by the European Commission and/or the United Kingdom. Further information about our international transfers as well as the safeguards in place can be provided upon request.
Security
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the Personal Data in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes physical and technical security measures to protect our Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration, and from unauthorised disclosure or access. Although please note that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure.
Contact us
Epsilon International UK Ltd is the controller of the Personal Data that we process as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any question about the processing, please

.
Our Data Protection Officer is tasked with informing and advising us on the obligations that apply to us under Data Protection Laws, as well as monitoring our compliance with the same. If you need to contact our Data Protection Officer, please email us

Data Protection Authority
. The same applies if you are a UK resident, please visit the

For example, the Tradedoubler company, or companies, deciding why and how we use information about you when visiting our websites or contacting us directly. Or the Brand acting as a Data Controller, and where we act as Processor (only acting on their instructions) in collecting information on interaction with ads, from Publishers or Content Creators– see section 11.
​
The
Data Processor
of personal data is the natural person or legal entity who processes personal data on the behalf of the Data Controller. A Data Processor may in turn enlist its own Data Processors, referred to as
Sub-Processors
, to carry out some tasks. For example, where we act as Processor for Brands in collecting information on interactions on ads at Publishers or Content Creators, and where those Publishers and Content Creators then act as our Sub-Processors.
​
As a Data Processor, we do not decide why, or in any material matter how, your personal data is processed.

2. Use of Information We Collect

For example, we may use your most frequently visited stores or shopping history to display offers for similar stores in relevant parts of the Services or to present special offers that may interest you via our Services, including in-store.

If you choose to participate in our referral programs, you represent and warrant that you have a personal relationship with your referral and that you are authorized to share their information with Rakuten for the purpose of Rakuten sending a communication to invite them to join the Services. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information through our referral service and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact our member services at
https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions
.
3. Disclosure of Information
We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:
Disclosure to Our Service Providers
We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Rakuten affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, process payments, facilitate your product purchases, and administer your rewards or payments.
Disclosure to Our Business Partners
We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:
Affiliate Partners
When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.
In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.
Referral Marketing Partners
In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.
If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction and account information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com and receive service messaging from ShopStyle on completing your Rakuten account set up. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit
www.shopstyle.com/privacy.
Financial Partners
For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.
We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.
Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers
To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
.
Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies
We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.
Disclosure for Legal Purposes
We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Rakuten or any third party.
In Relation to Business Asset Transfers
We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Rakuten assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.
In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

We encourage you to maintain the accuracy of the information you submit to us. You may provide account updates by logging into your Service account and updating your information in the Settings.

Email Marketing
We may send you periodic electronic communications and direct mailings when you sign up for an account. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from us at any time by following the instructions provided in those communications to unsubscribe or stop them, modifying the settings of your account, or contacting us through the Services. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may continue to send you non-promotional emails and other types of communications, as permitted by law, such as service emails relating to our ongoing business relationship. Service emails contain service-related announcements that affect your account, such as product order confirmations, reward or payment updates, and responses to your comments and feedback submitted to us.

Data Collection and Sharing Preferences
You may in some cases have the option to decline to provide us with certain information; however, your choice may impact your use of certain features or services for which that information is a necessary component.
Mobile App/Browser Extension
You can prospectively stop all collection of information by our mobile application and/or browser extension by uninstalling our mobile application and/or browser extension. Because the browser extension and mobile application permit data about your online behavior on that device or browser to be collected when installed, even without interaction, they must be uninstalled to withdraw your consent to this data collection. In some instances, you can opt out of certain data collection by updating your Settings within the browser extension or your mobile device settings.

Our Clients’ Visitors
We may also process Personal Information of our Clients’ visitors and customers, and visitors to our Clients’ websites (or our Client’s application downloads) in performance of the Services on behalf of our Clients. In this context we are a “service provider” or “data processor” (as those terms are defined by applicable laws). This Personal Information may consist of Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, account or membership numbers (without a key to personally identify you), and/or email addresses, although, if it is our Clients sending email addresses to us, we request that our Clients encrypt email addresses prior to sending to us. We take security measures to protect all Personal Information, including by hashing IP addresses and further encrypting email addresses. We do not associate Personal Information with individuals and are subject to our Clients’ instructions regarding such collection and use of such Personal Information. As a vendor of our Clients, the bases for our collection and processing of Personal Information of their customers and visitors may be through consent obtained by our Client, our Client’s legitimate interests, or (in accordance with applicable law) a lawful business purpose.

Other than to our Client that is utilizing our Services (who is the “business” or “controller”), Impact does not disclose Personal Information about you with other people or companies that are not Affiliates, except under the following circumstances:
in order to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information
Client Personal Information is accessible through our Client online accounts (“Client Portals”). Clients are able to access their Personal Information to update and correct their Personal Information. If you no longer have access to the Client Portals, you may submit a request to remove Personal Information you provided to us by emailing a request to privacy@impact.com or contacting us by telephone or mail as further specified in the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before removing your information.
We reserve the right to retain and use Client Personal Information as reasonably necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you, and in order to comply with applicable laws, including privacy and/or data protection legislation.
If you are not a Client but have signed-up to receive information from us and would like to be removed from our mailing lists, you may use the “unsubscribe” instructions in our newsletters or electronic communications, or email such request to privacy@impact.com or contact us by telephone or mail as further specified in the How to Contact Us clause of this Privacy Policy.
If you are a customer of one of our Clients, or a visitor to their website (or have downloaded one of our Client’s applications), please contact the Client to request access to your Personal Information, or to correct or have such information deleted. If you do contact Impact, Impact does not associate the data that we process on behalf of our Clients with any particular individual, and Impact may not be able to verify whether we have Personal Information that belongs to you. See information below at How to Contact Us if you have questions regarding this policy or requests regarding your Personal Information.
Other Information
Log Data
Impact collects information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit our Website or use our Services, and we collect browser and device data as part of our Services for our Clients (“Log Data”). When we collect this of our Clients, this Log Data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Website or Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, your activity on those pages and other statistics. In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Services’ functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. When you access the Services by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, your location information and other statistics. Please see the section regarding Location Information below regarding the use of your location information and your options.
The Log Data that we collect for our Clients, of visitors to their website or mobile applications, includes the visitor’s computer or mobile device IP address, browser type, browser version, and the ads that you interact with. If you are referred by one of our Clients to another’s website or application from interactions with the ads, we are passed information if you conclude an action there, such as the purchase of goods or services, signing-up for a newsletter or downloading an application. Impact does not receive your name, address, credit card, or other personally identifying information.
Location Information
In addition to Log Data, Impact may use and store information about Clients and Clients’ visitors’ location depending on the permissions that have been set on the relevant device. We use this information about our Clients to provide features of our Services and to improve and customize our Services. For our Clients’ visitors, Impact collects location information to attribute actions to particular Clients and for fraud prevention. You can enable or disable location services through your device settings.
Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and transferred to your device. For visitors to our Website and our Clients’ visitors, we use cookies to collect information in order to perform and improve our Website and Services. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The “Help” feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Website or Services (or our Clients’ websites) and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Integrations
For Clients, you may enhance the Services by enabling Impact integrations with third-party products. If you provide third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Further, Impact software may request permissions to take actions on your behalf using your third-party account credentials.
Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals (our “agents”) to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Service-related services and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. Examples may include processing and storing data, delivering messages, processing credit card payments, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are under written obligation not to disclose or use your Personal Information for any purpose other than those disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We do not transfer data to non-agent third parties, except as indicated above in “Personal Information Collection and Use”.
Notwithstanding any legal and contractual obligations between us and our agents, we remain potentially liable for any misuse of your Personal Information.
Your Options for Communications
For Clients and our Website visitors that sign-up to be contacted, Impact may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.
Security of Personal Information
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.
International Transfer of Personal Information
Your Personal Information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction, and in some cases be less stringent as compared to those of your own region. Our servers are located in data centers within the United States and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Impact utilizes the EEA’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the purposes of transfers from the EEA to Impact and its Affiliates located outside of the EEA. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. Our Affiliates process Personal Information if necessary and appropriate for the business purposes (or legal basis) for which it was collected, and this may include if you have contacted the Affiliate directly for assistance or provide them directly with your information. Your consent to this Privacy Policy and your submission of Personal Information represents your agreement to those transfers.
Links to Other Sites
Our website and Services may contain links to other web sites or online locations that are not operated or controlled by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every online site or location you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children’s Privacy
Only persons who are age 18 or older have permission to access our Services. Our Services are not for access by anyone under the age of 18 (“Children”). We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a Child without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
If the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to your Personal Information, we confirm that we are a Service Provider for our Clients and that we do not sell your Personal Information (which under the CCPA includes information about your household). We only share such Personal Information as described in this policy. Impact processes your Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy, which include the following “business purposes” under the CCPA:
Security. Impact uses and may disclose information to detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, and for protecting against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity. For example, to protect our Services, Impact may receive or disclose information about IP addresses that malicious actors have compromised.
Analytics & Services. Impact uses information for analytics to understand how our Services are used, as well as in the performance of our Services. We disclose data to our Clients pursuant to our agreements with them and their instructions, and this includes Personal Data of visitors to their websites and applications. If instructed by a Client to delete Personal Data, we delete the data or anonymized it (including automatically after a set period of time).
Maintenance of our Services. Impact uses Personal Information of our Clients to ensure that our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting bugs and other issues that we observe or that are reported to us.
Research and Development. Impact uses Personal Information of our Clients concerning their use of our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our Clients. We do not use Personal Information of our Clients’ visitors for these purposes.
Use of Service Providers. Personal Information is processed by our Affiliates and third-party Service Providers to perform services on our behalf, in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we utilize cloud storage solutions to store data that we process.
Compliance. Impact also uses information to satisfy applicable laws or regulations, and discloses information in response to legal process or enforceable government requests, including to law enforcement.
If the CCPA is applicable to you and you have additional questions or requests related to your rights under the CCPA, see How to Contact Us below.
Retention and Deletion
Impact retains Personal Data only as long as is reasonably necessary for the performance of its Services, and Personal Data of our Clients’ visitors is automatically deleted or anonymized after ninety days. When Impact is requested to delete Personal Data prior to such automatic deletion, we follow a process to make sure that genuine requests are honored. This involves verifying that the requestor is the individual that is the data subject, or, if the request comes from a Client about its visitors, we delete Personal Data as instructed by our Client. Since we do not collect personally identifiable information of our Client’s visitors, if the information comes directly from a Client’s visitor we may not be able to verify that we have any such data, or to match a request with a particular Client.
When deleting data, the Personal Data is completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. If we have collected Personal Data about you from more than one Client, we will delete all instances of the Personal Data that we have at the time of the request (to the extent that we are able to verify and match such data). However, if you subsequently authorize or visit the same Client or another Client’s website or application, we will have processed your Personal Data in relation to such authorization or visit.
Privacy Policy Changes
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of our website and/or the Services after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our website.

Privacy statement
Revised Effective March 25, 2022
1. Introduction and Scope
Partnerize and its subsidiary companies (together “we,” “our” or “us”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the security and privacy of all personal information we collect or handle.
Partnerize is the trading name of Performance Horizon Group Limited, a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom with an address of 6th Floor, West One, Forth Banks, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. Partnerize is registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office with registration number Z2226774.
Partnerize provides websites such as www.partnerize.com, www.pepperjam.com and www.brandverity.com (each a “Website”) and software and services through online platforms that help our business clients find and compensate publisher partners who display their advertisements, and also provides such clients with online brand monitoring services (each a “Platform”, and collectively with the Websites, the “Services”). This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to all Services that link to this Statement.
Data Collection – Partnerize Services
Partnerize controls the collection, use, disclosure or retention of personal information in the following contexts:
When you provide personal information to us through forms or chat functions on our Websites for the purposes of learning more about Partnerize Services;
When you provide personal information to us when you register to use our Services;
When you provide personal information to us as part of an application for employment through the “Careers” page of the Partnerize Website or through other means;
For personal information that our Websites and/or Platforms automatically collect from you as you use and navigate our Services;
When business intelligence service providers or existing Partnerize clients send us information regarding individuals engaging in affiliate marketing; and
When you provide personal information to Partnerize through other channels such as by email, telephone and direct communications.
If you submit information of other individuals to Partnerize through the Services, you must be legally permitted to share that personal information with Partnerize.
Data Collection – Consumers
Partnerize provides software and services that help advertisers find publisher partners to display their advertisements, and help advertisers compensate those publishers when a consumer clicks on one of those advertisements and then engages with the advertiser’s website. In order to enable this, Partnerize records a consumer’s journey from a publisher website to an advertiser website. In this process, Partnerize may record end consumer’s IP addresses, browser information, device and operating system information and/or cookie information. Partnerize also collects limited transactional information from the advertiser relating to subsequent engagement with that advertiser’s website, such as a product purchase. We collect this information to provide client support, invoicing and payment services, fraud detection, system maintenance and to develop additional functionality. We do not collect or record personally identifying information such as names, contact information, shipping information, payment card numbers or usernames from end consumers, nor do we use information from these transactions for our own direct marketing purposes. If you are a consumer, you should review the privacy policies of the advertiser websites to better understand what information is collected on those websites.
Partnerize’s BrandVerity solution provides brand monitoring services. These services do not involve the collection or handling of personally identifying information relating to consumers.
Data Collection – Third Party Services
The websites that link to this Statement may contain links to websites owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. These unaffiliated third-party websites may collect information about you under their own privacy notices and terms of service. Partnerize does not control, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third parties.
