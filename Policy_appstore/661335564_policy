Data processing overview
Provisioning and use of the website
We automatically process the data that is collected when you access the site in order to deliver the pages to you and to ensure the operation of the website. A hosting provider acts as data processor for us. The resulting data is deleted after 7 days. In the context of the use of the website, generally no data directly attributable to you is processed, but only pseudonyms such as the IP address.

Details on data processing
Data processing when using the website
Purpose
We process data on your requests in order to be able to deliver the pages you have requested. In order to be able to check the system stability and to be able to carry out further analyses in case of attacks, we store this data in an access log.
We do not draw conclusions about persons (we reserve the right to do so only in the case of targeted attacks on our server to the necessary extent).
Legal basis
Data processing is carried out in our legitimate interest, which lies in the provision of a functional and stable website via a technically secure system.
Data
We process the following data, which your browser automatically provides us with:
your IP address (and possibly the name in the DNS system belonging to the IP address),
the URL of the call,
often the source of the call (so-called "referrer"), i.e. the embedding or previous page, and
often the browser type, browser version and the operating system used (you can usually disable this transmission in the browser or exchange it for other information).
Our system also processes other data created by us in this context:
Time of the retrieval,
size of the content retrieved and
status of the confirmation.
Storage duration
The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose of collection. The log is kept for 7 days and then deleted.
Recipient
The server operation is carried out by a technical service provider. This is our order processor and can come into contact with the data.
Necessary information
You are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide the data. In the event of a request, you do not have to provide any data at all; instead, these data are processed automatically by the system. Without the above-mentioned data, the delivery of the website is technically impossible.
Cookies
Purpose
We use cookies in order to be able to transfer data between the individual page views, as otherwise each view would be completely independent of the previous ones. This serves in particular to provide technically necessary information.
Cookies are small text files that may contain personal data, but often contain only purely technical information. They are created when the website requests your browser to hold certain information as a cookie. The next time you visit the same website, the browser transmits this information so that the server can take it into account when delivering the website.
Storage duration, cookies used and their specific purpose:
The following cookies may be used:
Cookie name
Content
Purpose
Storage duration
wm-pref
Session ID
user preferences / language selection
approx. 30 min
Please note that cookies are only set if they are necessary. This means that only some of these cookies may be set for you.
Legal basis
We process the data in cookies, insofar as they are necessary for the operation of the website and its offers, on the basis of our legitimate interest in operating a website with extended functionalities.
Deletion
Our site instructs your browser to automatically delete cookies after the above-mentioned storage period has expired. You can delete cookies independently of this at any time in your browser by yourself. This is possible for individual cookies as well as for all cookies together. You can also block cookies for the future. How you do this depends on the specific program you are using. Here you will find the corresponding explanations for some common browsers:

Recipient
We only use cookies that are directly related to our website. Only the service providers necessary for the operation of the website may have access to them (see explanations in the section on the website).
Necessary information
You do not have to provide any of the information stored in the cookies, nor is there any legal or contractual obligation to do so. If you make a certain selection or input that is required beyond the call of the individual concrete page, this information is stored in a cookie.
If you block cookies altogether, certain functional restrictions on the website may occur (it is no longer possible to log in and save preferences such as language). This is due to the fact that cookies are technically necessary for the provision of the service.
Support requests
Purpose
If you contact us with support requests, we will process your data to identify the cause of the problem you describe and remedy it. We also make anonymous copies of the requests to build up a knowledge base that makes subsequent problem resolution faster and more reliable.
Legal basis

Storage duration
The data is stored for up to one year after the last answer/support activity for the respective inquiry, in order to be able to answer your follow-up questions in relation to the problem quickly and effectively. We store the anonymous entries in the knowledge database as long as these entries are relevant. If and for as long as necessary, we then store the data for the purpose of complying with statutory retention obligations.
Recipient
The data is processed via our hoster, which acts as a data processor. It is possible that we work together with development service providers for development and bug fixing. These would then act as necessary data processors for us and only receive the relevant data necessary to complete your request. Otherwise, these data will only be processed by us and persons working for us.
Necessary information
You must provide us with information about the relevant problem, otherwise we will not be able to take steps to correct it. We also need your contact details for our reply. Please provide your name so that we can contact you by name (this is not mandatory). However, none of the information is required by law or contract.
The automatically collected information is necessary for the implementation of our support process, at least temporarily, but you are not required to provide any of it.
