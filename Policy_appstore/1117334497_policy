Currently, the European Commission does not consider Russia as a country that ensures the
            adequate level of data protection under the GDPR. So, when transferring personal data to
            these companies in Russia, we have implemented additional appropriate safeguards as
            required under Article 46 of the GDPR.
To maintain your privacy during the money transfers, we have adopted standard data
            protection clauses approved by the European Commission in accordance with Article
            46(2)(c) of the GDPR with all companies involved in the processing of personal data
            data.
Standard data protection clauses form an agreement that contains the description of mutual
            data protection obligations of data exporter and importer in relation to the processing of
            your personal data. If you need to obtain a copy, please
contact us

Financial institutions and money transfer providers
We cooperate with the network of financial institutions and money transfer institutions in
            many countries in the world, where you can send or receive money transfers. We also use
            payment processing services of international payment systems such as Visa International
            and Mastercard Worldwide.
When transferring data to third parties located outside Cyprus, we follow the below rules:
If you send or receive a transfer to/in countries outside the EEA which are not
                covered by the European Commission’s adequacy decision (such as Vietnam,
                Turkey and others), we share your data with partners in these countries in order to
                execute the money transfer you initiated and to fulfil the contract with you, or
                perform the contract concluded in your interest (such as when you are the recipient
                of the transfer). Article 49(1)(b),(c) of the GDPR provides us the legal basis for these
                transfers. In all cases, the amount of data is strictly limited to what is required for
                the performance of a transfer and partners undertake strict confidentiality
                obligations.
Besides, we endeavor to implement additional safeguards by signing the standard
                data protection clauses with all partners in countries outside the EEA which are not
                covered by the European Commission’s adequacy decision (in accordance with Article
                46(2)(c) of the GDPR).
If you send or receive transfer to/in EEA countries, or countries, ensuring the
                adequate level of protection, no further safeguards are required in relation to the
                personal data transfers to such countries according to Article 45 of the GDPR.
Other parties involved
We may also use third-party data processors to obtain some services and software. Such
            providers grant an adequate, sufficient safeguarding service when it comes to processing
            your data, since we carefully screen service providers by including specific demands in the
            event that their services involve the need to process personal data.

            operations they perform with your personal data on our behalf and instruct them how to

            If we receive from you the opt-out request, we will stop using your data for such a purpose.
Personal data we process
The scope of data collected for the verification purpose depends on:

For transfers below the basic limit, KoronaPay requests the sender’s full name, date of birth,

                from an employer, etc.)

about the existing limits for
            transfers and the verification process.
We may use photos of your passport or other identity document you 
            provide us to develop and improve our identity verification system.
Why we need your data
KoronaPay must check validity of the provided document and verify if the person making a
            payment order is real (not a robot), if a person is a politically exposed person (PEP), if a
            person is included in a blacklist or falls under any other restrictions. We receive the
            information from you directly and consult with AML approved sources and lists.
We use an identity verification system that helps us automatically verify documents. To develop 
            and improve this system, we need sample passports or other identity documents photos.
            We use them to train the system to improve fraud prevention processes and fulfil the AML legislation requirements.
Although the preliminary check is performed automatically, KoronaPay’s Compliance team
            performs manual examinations to make a decision.
How long do we store your data
According to the AML legislation, we must retain user account and all related data and
            documents for at least five (5) years after you made any transfer or identity verification
            request, or any risk is revealed, which requires us to retain data.
At the end of the retention period, we will erase your data, unless we are required to keep
            your data longer on other legal grounds (e.g. as a part of an investigation or if a legislation

to detect and prevent fraud
According to our internal procedures, we divide all transfers into different risk levels.
                Depending on this and several other factors, we monitor money transfers and can
                temporarily block a transfer to manually investigate and assess if it involves any
                illegal activity. We may also need to call or email you to be sure that the transfer is
                valid.

Your data protection rights
Under the GDPR you have several rights as a data subject. Please
contact us
if you want to
            exercise any of them. Note that we may request some additional information from you to
            verify your identity before we fulfill your request.
Right to access
You can ask us whether we are processing your personal data and if so, to receive or get
            access to a copy of your data (Article 15 of the GDPR).
Right to rectification
You can ask us to correct any errors in your personal data and make the data complete if
            you believe it is incomplete (Article 16 of the GDPR). You can correct some of your data in
            the account settings in the Mobile App.
Right to erasure of personal data (‘right to be forgotten’)
You can request us to delete your personal data (Article 17 of the GDPR). Please use the
            relevant option on the Mobile App or write a request to
kpesup@koronapay.com
. Please
            include in the message the phone number that you used to sign up in the Mobile App.
This right is set by the GDPR, but it also has certain restrictions under the GDPR: we are not
            allowed to delete your data upon your request, if we are required to retain it in accordance with law or it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article
            17(3)(b),(e) of the GDPR).
For instance, if you initiated transfers and/or proceeded with the verification of your identity
            in the Mobile App, the AML legislation obliges us to retain your information and all related
            documents for a period of five (5) years. This requirement is set by
Cyprus Law No.
            188(I)/2007 The Prevention And Suppression Of Money Laundering And Terrorist Financing
            Law
(see Article 68),
EU Directive 2015/849 on the Prevention of Money Laundering and
            Terrorist Financing
(see Article 40). So, if we receive your request, instead of deleting it we
            will block your account and stop processing your data for any purposes other than
            compliance with the law. Upon expiration of the retention period required by the law, we will
            delete it entirely.
Once the account is deleted or blocked it is impossible to use it or to register a new account
            with the same phone number, due to security reasons.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict or suppress the processing of your personal data
            (Article 18 of the GDPR).
Under the GDPR, we can fulfil this right in any of the cases below:
You challenge the accuracy of your personal data for a period, enabling us to verify
                the accuracy of the personal data;
You have objected to the processing of your personal data (according to Article 21(1)
                of the GDPR) and you are waiting for verification of whether our legitimate grounds
                override your interests, rights, or freedoms.
You believe the processing is unlawful and want to restrict the use of your data
                instead of deleting your data;
You need us to keep the data for you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Right to data portability
In some cases, you have the right to ask us to provide your personal data in a structured,
            commonly used and machine-readable format, and, if we can perform it technically, to send
            your data to other organisations (Article 20 of the GDPR).
Under the GDPR, we can fulfil this right when:
we rely on a consent or performance of a contract with you as the legal basis for
                such data processing;
we process data with automated tools
Right to object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data (Article 21 of the
            GDPR), if:
we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data; and
we cannot demonstrate a compelling legitimate interest that would override you
                interests, rights or freedoms.
In particular, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for direct
            marketing purposes, such as informing about promotions and offers or viewing ads, 
            and for purposes of developing and improving the identity verification system.
To make this process easier, we provide you with the following opt-out options:
unsubscribe link in communications we send you;
switching off the option of receiving any marketing information from us in the
                personal account settings in the Mobile App;
You may also
contact us
at any time with the relevant request.
Right to withdraw a consent
If you gave us a consent for processing your data, you can always change your mind and
            withdraw it at anytime. This right is set by Article 7(3) of the GDPR.
We use consent as a legal basis in the following cases:
use of analytical and marketing cookies (see
Use cookies technology on the
                Website
);
keeping data of job applicants who expressed interest in other positions at KoronaPay which 
                may later occur (see
Assess if a job applicant is fit for
                a position
).
You can adjust cookies settings either in the web browser or Cookies Control bar on the
            Website. You may also
contact us
at any time with the request to stop processing your data
            for the recruitment purposes.
Right to lodge a complaint
Having received the request or complaint from you, we will make every effort to resolve an
            issue concerning your personal data.
If you believe it to be appropriate you may address your complain to the supervisory
            authority in sphere of personal data of the country where you reside. The right to lodge a
            complaint is set by Article 77(1) of the GDPR.

How we protect your data
We implemented appropriate IT and organisational security measures to prevent your
            personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorised way,
            altered, or disclosed. We follow a risk-based approach, when determining which security
            measures and technologies to implement.
We protect your data when it is in transit and at rest, all money transfers data are
            encrypted; we store your data on secure servers; backup copies of data are stored
            encrypted only and separately from the production system that they were made from; all
            workstations are equipped with anti-virus protection; there are firewalls to segregate
            networks.
Payment card data is securely sent and processed by CardStandard Processing Center that
            is certified under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”). In line
            with this standard and rules of international payment systems (such as Visa International or
            MasterCard Worldwide), we never keep card security codes and do not store the payment
            card details in plain text.
We strictly limit access to personal data to those employees, contractors and third parties
            who have a business need-to-know. All personnel and third parties are bound by
            confidentiality obligations and are required to follow strict data protection and compliance
            standards while using and transferring data.
We regularly test the effectiveness of the measures and audit compliance with the set rules
            and procedures, we monitor security events, identify, and eliminate security vulnerabilities.
We have procedures on how to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify
            you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach, where we are legally required to do
            so. Depending on the circumstances of the breach, KoronaPay and Payment Center (acting
            as joint controllers) may inform data subject separately or jointly, decide on what shall be
            communicated to a subject and the means of such communication.
Policy Amendment
From time to time, we may change this policy and adopt its new version. The main reasons
            of policy amendment are introducing new services and features, termination of services or
            changes in applicable legal requirements.
We will inform you about a new version via a notification on the Website or the Mobile App.
            In the event of significant changes in data processing terms, such as those concerning the
            nature or means of processing, we will notify you about changes before they become
            effective.
