Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
Last updated: November 23, 2021
PRIVACY POLICY
This document explains how Electric French Fries Inc. (“EFF”) uses data that you give us when you use our apps. Our apps use third party tools from Google and Yahoo for advertising and diagnostics purposes and EFF itself also conducts some basic tracking. Please see Google, Yahoo, and Apple privacy policies for more detailed information about how those companies use the information gathered about you through the use of our apps.
About third parties and privacy
EFF uses Google AdMob to display advertising in our apps. This service collects granular (non-identifiable) information about users. For example, it is possible for EFF (and Google) to see the number of times people have viewed ads but not the specific users viewing ads.
EFF uses third parties to collect diagnostics and usage data from our apps. For this we use services called Google Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics, and Yahoo Flurry. The information collected informs us if our apps are crashing and helps us understand how our apps are being used (for example, which features of an app are most frequently used, or the number of daily users an app has in a particular country).
Some of our  apps currently make use of “IDFA” (a unique ID for each device which allows users to limit ad targeting in iOS). It’s safe to assume that any data gathered by Google via IDFA can be used to track you and can be linked to your identity. However, this only applies to devices running iOS 13 and earlier, and we are in the process of phasing out the use of IDFA from all of our apps.
About EFF and privacy
Many of our apps contain a widget called “More From Us” that displays a list of our apps. We use this widget primarily to help our users discover our other apps. We also use this widget to determine which app icons and text descriptions our users prefer. To do this, we measure the number of taps one icon receives versus another. None of the data collected is tied to individual users, the data is anonymous, and we don’t sell it or share it with anyone.
EFF uses camera and microphone functions in many of our apps. Permissions must be given by the user in order for these functions to be activated and at no time are photos, videos, or audio recordings (“media”) transmitted to EFF or any third party. None of our apps collect media in the “background” while the app is closed. In addition, users can restrict any of our apps’ media capturing functions at any time through privacy settings, or by simply deleting the app.
Our apps do not capture, retain, or transmit any photos or “face data” (e.g., photos of your face) without express user action. Some of our apps allow users to capture media (photos, videos, and/or audio); for example, a humorous video showing a user’s face. Such media may be temporarily stored on a device for processing and previewing, but no user-captured media is otherwise stored within the app or transmitted unless by express user action (for example, if the user saves an image to an app’s gallery or shares an image via instant message). No media is collected or transmitted to EFF or any third party and media cannot be viewed, listened to, or obtained by EFF or any third party. Media saved within EFF’s apps cannot be accessed by EFF or by third parties and can be deleted by the user at any time.
EFF may operate social media accounts. Information posted to our social media accounts is generally not retained by EFF, though EFF reserves the right to interact with users over social media platforms and to retain any publicly or privately shared transmissions.
EFF may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.

EFF reserves the right to modify this agreement at any time without giving you prior notice. Your use of the apps following any such modification constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the agreement as modified. The last date these Terms of Use were revised is set forth above.
