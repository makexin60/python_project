Privacy Policy
In general, WebForge does not collect personal information to send to the developer or any outside parties.
As with any iOS app, if the user has opted-in to share analytics with developers (using the feature built-in to iOS), general usage and crash data may be provided to the developer. This data may be used by the developer to debug and improve the app, and may include information about the app's state when the crash occurred. If the user has not opted-in, this information is not collected.
Project information and files are stored either on your device, on iCloud, or other services accessible through iOS file providers. These services may have their own privacy implications and you should be aware of these before using them. In any case, none of this information is sent to the developers of WebForge Pro.
Our business model is App and extension sales, not personal information. We want you to buy, use, promote, and enjoy our product - we do not want your personal information.
