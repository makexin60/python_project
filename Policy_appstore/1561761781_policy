Brexit and EU Data Processing
The UK has been granted an adequacy decision from the EU, meaning the laws and practices of the UK have been found to offer an essentially equivalent level of protection to personal data as is granted in the EU.
In the event the adequacy decision is revoked or expires (without renewal) and to ensure continuity of service for our customers, we have incorporated the SCCs into our customer contracts, accessible here via our Brexit update (
available here
).
The SCCs shall sit silent until and unless they are required to be put in place by either the UK or EU GDPR.

Why we have your information
We process personal data to fulfil our contractual obligations to our customers and to otherwise improve and market our solutions.
There are various ways in which we may process your personal data.
For example, because:
an organisation you work for uses one of our solutions;
an organisation you have engaged with uses our solutions to provide or otherwise make available a service to you;
you have used one of our solutions where we process your data in our capacity as data controller;
you have contacted us;
you work for us;
you visited our website;
your personal data was provided to us by a third party;
as a result of other lead generating activities done by us;
where you sign up or are otherwise registered to one of our platforms;
you are a signatory to a contract with us;
you attended one of our Access led events;
through the deployment of cookies (or similar technologies); or
Because you have provided feedback to us.
On what legal basis we have your information
We will only ever process your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so. We have expanded upon the reasons for us processing your personal data below.
1. Where an organisation you work for uses one of our solutions
If you use our solutions through your employer, for example, our HR, Payroll, or eLearning solutions, then we will process your personal data as a
processor
(your employer is the controller).
We recommend you read your employer’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc.,
Third parties may also process your personal data (on our behalf). The details of these third parties will be included in the contract we hold with the controller (your employer).
See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller.
2. Where you have engaged with an organisation that uses one or more of our solutions
If you use our solutions via a third-party organisation; for example, to submit your CV to a recruitment agency, or to donate money on a charity’s website, then we will process your personal data as a
processor
(the relevant third-party organisation is the controller).
We recommend you read the third-party organisation’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc.,
Some of our solutions have dedicated privacy notices, where this is the case, these are accessible via our
Security Portal
or alternatively, they may be accessible within the solution itself.

See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller.

save for where the exception below applies
