Personal data and processing
Personal data
is any kind of information that is relating to a living person, either directly (for example name or social security number) or indirectly. Examples of information that can be indirectly related to a living person are behavior data, diagnosis, images and audio recordings that are processed in a computer without any names being mentioned.
All types of measures taken which include personal data constitute
processing
of personal data. Common examples of processing are collection, registration, organisation, structuring, using, storage, processing, transmission and deletion.
According to Article 6 of the GDPR, in order to process your personal data, we need to rely on a legal basis, which in our case is contract, consent, weighing of interests or legal obligation. Insofar as we process sensitive personal data (e.g. data about your health), we need to rely on a legal exception for such processing. Such exceptions can be found in GDPR Article 9.2a (explicit consent) and 9.2h (healthcare), 9.2b (labor law) and 9.2f (defense of legal claims).
We will only process sensitive personal data (such as data about your health) to provide you with healthcare or if we have received your explicit consent to do so.

Recipients of data
Employees of Yazen
Your personal data will be shared with our employees (including consultants) who need access to them in order to fulfil their tasks.
Processors
In cases where it is necessary for us to be able to offer our services, we share your personal data with companies that are processors in relation to us. This applies, for example, to our suppliers of IT solutions and marketing. A processor is a company that processes information on our behalf and based on our instructions.
The processors may only process personal data in accordance with the purposes and instructions on processing and security that we have provided to them in a data processing agreement.
Independent controllers
We also share your personal data with certain companies that are independent controllers. The fact that the receiving entity is an independent controller means that we are not determining how the personal data disclosed will be processed by the receiving entity. Independent controllers with whom we share your personal data are:
State authorities (the police, the Swedish Tax Agency, The Health and Social Care inspectorate/IVO, The Social Insurance Agency/Försäkringskassan, or other authorities) if we are obliged to do so by law or in the event of a suspected offence.
Companies offering payment solutions

When your personal data is shared with a company that is an independent data controller, that company's privacy notice will be applicable.
How long do we store/save your data?
We only process your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes described above.
We will delete or anonymize your personal data when you no longer use our services or the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes it has been collected for, unless we have a legal obligation to save the personal data or we need to do so to defend our legal claims. For example, as a registered healthcare provider, we have an obligation under the Patient Data Act to save patient records for ten (10) years, which means that we cannot delete or anonymize the information contained in patient records before that time has passed. Further, there are legal requirements stating that accounting documents need to be saved for seven (7) years, etc.
Personal data stored on the basis of your consent will be deleted if you withdraw your consent. You can read more about how to withdraw your consent in below. Withdrawal of consent does not affect our obligation to keep records or process personal data in accordance with applicable laws as stated above.
Where we process your personal data
We always endeavor to ensure that your personal data is processed within the EU/EEA but it may happen that your personal data is transferred to a third country. Regardless of where your personal data is processed, we take reasonable legal technical and organizational security measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU/EEA. In cases where personal data is processed outside the EU/EEA, the level of protection is guaranteed either by a decision from the European Commission that the country in question ensures an adequate level of protection or by the use of so-called appropriate safeguards. If you would like more information about the protection measures taken, you are welcome to contact us by email to dpo@yazen.com.
Risks and security measures
Yazen uses technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against loss and to protect it against unauthorized access. This includes, for example, secure and private connections (such as VPN), encryption, and that access to your personal data is always limited to those employees who need access to perform their jobs. We continuously evaluate our systems and procedures and policies to ensure that they are secure and protected.
What are your rights?
You have several rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. More information about your rights can be found on the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection/IMY's website:

If you wish to exercise your rights or have questions, please contact us. Contact details can be found at the top of this data protection notice.
Right to information
You have the right to be informed about how we process your personal data, which we provide you through this privacy notice.
Right of access
You can request information as to whether we process personal data relating to you and, if so, receive a copy of the personal data processed - a so-called register extract - together with certain more detailed information
Right of rectification
We have a responsibility to ensure that the personal data we process is correct, but if you consider that personal data relating to you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request that the information be corrected.

Withdrawal of consent does not affect the legality of the processing of your personal data that took place before the withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent does not affect our obligation to keep patient records or process personal data in accordance with applicable legislation. In other words, when there is such relevant legislation to adhere to, we might still have the obligation to process your personal data according to such legislation and if so, we must continue the processing to the extent the legislation states.
Right to limitation of processing
In certain cases, for example if you have objected to the processing, you have the possibility to request a limitation of the processing of your personal data. By requesting a limitation, you have, at least for a certain period of time, the possibility to stop us from using the data other than to, for example, defend legal claims. You can also prevent us from erasing the data, for example if you need the data to claim damages.
Right to erasure
In certain cases, you can obtain the erasure of your personal data. When your personal data is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, is needed to fulfill a legal obligation or when we need to establish, to assert or defend legal claims, we cannot erase the data.

If we process personal data relating to you to fulfill an agreement, you have the possibility in certain cases to obtain your personal data to use it somewhere else, for example transferring the data to another personal data controller.
