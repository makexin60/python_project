Lastly, we may also disclose non-Personal Information, aggregated with information about our other users, to our clients, business partners, merchants, advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if we deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons or justifications.
Finally, we reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Information) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company relating to the Services, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of our business.

How We Protect Information
We take several measures intended to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. No system is 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Transmitting Personal Information is done at your own risk. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third-party providers, such as social networks. We are not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. The Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology intended to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers. The Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm NK's identity before any personally identifiable information is sent.
You should also be aware of the security features available to you through your internet browser. You should use a security-enabled internet browser to submit your credit card information and other Personal Information to the Services.
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from us, at all times.
Non-Personal Information Collected
We also collect non-Personal Information relating to the Services, that is, information that does not personally identify an individual. The non-Personal Information we collect includes how you interact with the Services, information generally collected or logged by Internet websites or Internet services when accessed or used by users, and information about your web browser or device accessing or using the Services.
Examples of the non-Personal Information we collect are:
The pages of our Site that you viewed during a visit or the features of the App you use;
What information, content or advertisements you view or interact with using the Services;
Language preferences;
The city and state in which you are located (but not your precise geographic location); and

Data collected regarding outdoor weather and environmental sensor values with other identifying or geographic location information removed are considered non-Personal Information.
As discussed in more detail below, we sometimes use cookies and other automatic information gathering technologies to gather non-Personal Information. We will not use non-Personal Information to try to identify you, and if we associate any non-Personal Information with information that personally identifies you, then we will treat it as Personal Information. Additionally, we may transform your Personal Information into non-Personal Information (including, with respect to information regarding your geographic location, by generalizing (i.e. abstracting) that location so that it can no longer identify you).
Information collected by the Services may be collected by us or one of our Service Providers (as defined below) or Online Tool Providers.

Cookies
This site uses first and third-party cookies and similar technologies to process personal information for the purposes described in this Policy. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.

Do Not Track
Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. However, you may still exercise your privacy rights as described elsewhere in this Policy.
Global Privacy Control
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit an opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, to online services you visit. When we detect such signal, we place a U.S. Privacy String setting in your browser so that any third party who respects that signal will not track your activity on our website. Your request to opt-out of sale/sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only and not linked to any account information because the connection between your browser and the account is not known to us. GPC is supported by certain internet browsers or as a browser extension.
