Moving to Digital Business.
WolkAbout stands out from other vendors. The scalability and autonomy of their Platform are a great advantage.
The technical elements' quality and their Team's support are also excellent. Platforms based on AWS or Azure components provide fewer degrees of freedom for a higher cost.
