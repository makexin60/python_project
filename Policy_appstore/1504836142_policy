4. Information we may collect:
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data whether the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

During the course of creating an account with Sprive, the information you give to us may include:
Identity Data
- such as your first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth, address and employment history, and citizenship
Contact Data
- such as your address, email address and telephone number
Financial Data
- such as your bank account details, your income and outgoings, credit history including details of any history of bankruptcy or county court judgements, mortgages held, and, if the lender requires, direct debit details, for instance if your chosen mortgage product requires any payment for things such as valuation. As an optional opt-in service, we obtain your credit score and credit report from one of the UK leading Credit Reference Agencies (CRA) on your behalf and refresh the report on a monthly basis.
Transaction Data
- such as your bank account transaction information - but not your login or password - for example, purchase item, price, location, date. This data is provided with your consent through a third party Open Banking provider.
You may also provide us with certain information by filling in other forms, entering competitions or promotions or by corresponding with us by phone, email, text message or through our live in-App chat function.
Sprive does not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race, ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health or your biometric or genetic information). However, this may be subject to change if Sprive begins to sell mortgage protection insurance, which may require us to ask health related questions.
However, it's important to note that some of the information you provide us with may become Special Category data when collated to form part of your mortgage application.
We need your consent to process this data, and this is why we ask you to let us know that you agree to our Privacy Policy.
This means we can continue to process your application with Special Category Personal Data included (as we wouldn't be able to provide our service without it).

7. Storing your information
7.1 Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where legally required to do so.
Where we have given you, or where you have chosen, a password or personal identification number (PIN) which enables you to access certain parts of our website or App, you are responsible for keeping this password or PIN confidential. We ask you not to share this password or PIN with anyone.
7.2 Out of the EEA
Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Areas (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by:
(a) only transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
(b) using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection is has in Europe (known as ‘model contracts’); or
(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
7.3 Data retention
We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements - as documented in Sprive’s data retention policy. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
