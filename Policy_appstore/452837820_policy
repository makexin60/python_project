1. What Information We Collect From You and How We Use It
COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We collect information that can be used to identify or contact a particular person (we refer to this type of information as "
personal information
"). Personal information includes information that does not directly identify you by name or include your contact information, but which may be used to identify that a specific computer or device has accessed our Website and Online Services and which if combined with certain other information could be used to identify you.

LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EUROPEAN VISITORS ONLY)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, the applicable legal basis for our processing of your personal information normally includes one of the following:
´
Based on your consent
. In some cases, at the point at which you provide personal information, we may ask you for your consent to collect and process such information. If you choose to provide us with your consent, you may later withdraw your consent (or
opt-out
) by contacting us using the contact details provided under the
How You Can Contact
Us section below. Please note that if you withdraw your consent it will not affect any processing of your personal information that has already occurred. Where we process your personal information based on consent, we will provide more detailed information to you at the time when we obtain your consent.
´
Performance of a contract
. In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are subject. Where we are processing your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are a party, you may not be able to object to such processing, or if you do choose to opt-out or object to such processing, it may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation that you are owed.
´
Compliance with applicable laws
. In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to comply with an applicable law. Where we process your personal information to meet our legal obligations, you will likely not be permitted to object to such processing, but you will usually have the right to access or review the relevant personal information unless it would impede our legal obligations.
´
Our legitimate interests
. We may process your personal information based on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party) to the extent such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In such cases, you have the right to object to the relevant processing of your personal information by contacting us as described under the How You Can Contact Us section below.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make such legitimate interests clear to you at the relevant time.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the How You Can Contact Us section below.
ACTIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION
Like many other websites, we actively collect information from our visitors both by asking specific questions on the Website and Online Services and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, “Contact Us” forms, or other methods made available to you on our Website and Online Services. Some of the information that you submit may be personal information. We use this information for the purposes for which you provide it and for any other purpose described at the time information is submitted by you, as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as permitted or required by applicable law.
We generally collect and use personal information provided to us on the Website and Online Services for the following purposes:
to establish, develop, and preserve our business relationships with our customers and other individuals with whom we conduct business, and to respond to your inquiries;
to provide our products and services, including, as necessary, to establish or verify the credit of persons who use, or intend to use, our products or services;
to allow individuals to apply for employment with us;
to authenticate the identity and preserve the privacy of customers or potential customers who contact us by telephone, electronic means, or otherwise;
to allow customers and Website visitors to register for and attend training sessions and classes;
for quality assurance purposes;
to manage our business and ensure the efficiency, reliability, and security of our systems;
to meet legal and regulatory requirements and to allow us to meet contractual requirements relating to our products and services;
to ensure our records are accurate and protect customers and our business from error and fraud;
to understand and assess the interests, wants, and changing needs of our customers and Website visitors with a view to improving our products and services and developing new ones;
to provide our customers and Website and Online Services visitors with personalized products and services as well as product recommendations; and
to notify our customers and Website visitors about changes to the Website and Online Services or upcoming products and services offered or provided by us, our affiliates, or our business partners that may be of interest to our customers and Website visitors.
We may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws. In any event, we take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and, where necessary, kept up-to-date.
PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION
Some of the information we collect depends on the settings on your web browser or mobile device. Please check your web browser or mobile device if you want to learn what information your browser or mobile device sends or how to change your settings. In addition to the information sent by your web browser or mobile device, as you navigate through a website or mobile app, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection.
Like most website operators, we and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies, local shared objects (or any other successor tracker technology), Software Development Kits, and pixel tags that automatically receive and track certain data about how you and other visitors interact with our Website and Online Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. For example, we may collect information about the technology you use (such as browser, type of computer, operating systems, mobile device and network used, and Internet service providers) and server log data (such as access dates and times, online features or pages viewed, system activity, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Website). These technologies are described in more detail below.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, mobile apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the website or app you are visiting or using are called “
first party cookies
” (so cookies served by us while you are using our Website are first party cookies). Cookies served by companies that are not operating the website or app you are visiting or using are called “
third party cookies
” (so, a website analytics provider may set a cookie on your computer via our Website while you visit our Website). Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “
Session Cookies
” last only as long as your browser or app is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser or app. Other cookies are “
persistent cookies
” meaning that they survive after your browser or app is closed (for example, they may recognize your computer when you re-open our online services).
“
Local shared objects
” (also called Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies) and any other successor technology refers generally to the collection of cookie-like data stored on a browser or computer by web sites, ads, or third parties.
“
Pixel tags
” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a web page, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, web site visited, time of visit, referring web site, IP address, and other similar information (including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device). Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner.
“
Software Development Kits
” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, thereby allowing such partners to collect certain information about user interaction with the app, information about the user device, and network information.
In this Privacy Policy, these and similar technologies are collectively referred to as “
cookies and technologies
.” Please see our
Cookie Notice
for more information. The following table sets out the different categories of cookies and technologies that our Website and Online Services may use and why we use them:
Cookie Types
Purpose
Authentication
These cookies and technologies tell us when you’re using our Website and Online Services so we can show you the appropriate features and content such as your account information, purchase history, and to edit your account settings.
Security and Website Integrity
These cookies and technologies support or enable security features to help keep our Website and Online Services safe and secure. For example, they enable us to remember when you are logged into a secure area of our Website and help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you.
Online Service Features
These cookies and technologies provide functionality that help us deliver products and services. For example, cookies help you log in by pre-filling fields. We may also use these cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social plugins (for example, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn) and other customized content and experiences.
Analytics and Research
These cookies and technologies are used to understand, improve, and research our Website and Online Services, and better understand the interests of people who interact with our Website and Online Services. For example, we and our approved partners may use these cookies and technologies to understand how you are using Website features, and segmenting audiences for feature testing. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use and interact with our Website and Online Services.
