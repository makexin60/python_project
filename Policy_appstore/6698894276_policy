Privacy Policy
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Merge ("the App"), operated by Merge Labs Ltd ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, shares, and protects your information. This policy applies to anyone who downloads, installs, or uses our Apps, which are provided as a commercial service.
By using the Apps, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Apps.
Information
Information that is kept solely on your devices
We prioritize your privacy and data integrity. Your data is kept solely on your devices, meaning we do not have access to it.
Bluetooth Connection: The App uses Bluetooth to connect to devices and may access Bluetooth identifiers.
Notifications: The App sends push notifications from your iPhone to your watch via Bluetooth.
Location Information: The App requests location permissions to track workout routes, which is only active when a workout is in progress. Some Android versions also require location permissions to access Bluetooth, but the App does not use location for any other purposes.
App Icons: The App may fetch app icons to display them in notifications. Our servers may see anonymous requests for app icons.
Health Information: The App syncs health information from the watch to Apple Health.
Contacts: The App syncs contact information from your iPhone to your watch.
Once your data is synced to Apple Health or Google Contacts, some of it may be sent to their cloud services, as per their policies.
Information We Collect
Anonymous Usage Statistics: The App may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve its functionality and services.
Log Data: In case of errors, we may collect data on your device, including IP address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the App, usage time and date, and other statistics. Log data is retained for three months.
Purchase Information: We may retain information about your past purchases and subscriptions through the App for operational, support, and legal purposes, although subscription transactions are managed by Apple.
Third-Party Services: The App may use third-party services that may collect information, such as IP addresses and identifiers, potentially used to identify you across channels for marketing purposes. Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the App will be provided.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information collected for the following purposes:
Enhancing Functionality: To improve and optimize your experience, prioritize features, and refine the App's services and functionality.
Improving the App: To analyze usage patterns and trends to make enhancements to the App.
Service Providers: We may employ third-party companies to facilitate the App, perform App-related services, or assist us in analyzing usage.
How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal or sensitive user data. We may share anonymous usage statistics with third-party service providers to help us analyze and improve the App. Third parties with access to your information are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purposes unless required by law.
Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals for:
Facilitating our Service;
Providing the Service on our behalf;
Performing Service-related tasks; or
Assisting us in analyzing App usage.
These third parties may have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are prohibited from using it for other purposes, unless required by law. We select service providers that adhere to strict privacy standards. Links to their privacy policies will be provided where relevant.
Children Under 13
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete that information.
Data Security
We value your trust in providing us with your information and use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Transaction and log data, if retained, are encrypted.
Links to Other Sites
This App may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of those websites, as we have no control over and assume no responsibility for their content, privacy policies, or practices.
Data Retention and Deletion
We retain personal and sensitive user data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. Log data is retained for three months for support and troubleshooting purposes.
Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. You are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. We will notify you of updates by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
