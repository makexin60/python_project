Note that we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized to act on behalf of another individual.
How We Protect and Retain Personal Information
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
Our website permits you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.
We retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.
Cookie Policy
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. We use cookies in order to improve your online experience and to facilitate effective site administration. Cookies enable us to keep track of your reservation as you book on our site. They also allow us to recognize guests who have saved their info with us when they visit, and to provide those guests with their account information. If you save your info with Spirit or book on our site, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our site and what you book. If you have not saved your info with us or booked from our site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us to serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and
promotions.
Through our use of cookies, we track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to visiting
www.spirit.com.
Keeping track of the site you came from prior to visiting
www.spirit.com
can help us to improve our site design.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Web browser. However, if you turn off cookies, we may not be able to track your reservation, which means you may be unable to book on our site. Also, we may not be able to recognize you as a guest who has saved information with us.
We allow certain third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (“behavioral advertising” or “targeted advertising”). If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site.
As discussed in the Your Choices section above, if you would like to opt-out of online targeted advertising, you can adjust your choices by clicking the cookie icon button.  You may opt-out of other forms of targeted advertising by submitting a request through our
online portal
as described in that section.
California Notice of Financial Incentive
We offer our customers a loyalty program (
Free Spirit

that provides certain perks, such as rewards and special promotions. We may also provide other programs, such as sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other similar promotional campaigns (collectively, the “Programs”). When you sign up for one of our Programs, we will ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the Program.
You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms. Visit the

Sharing of Information for targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising.
As discussed in the “cookies policy” section below we engage in targeted advertising.

In addition, we also may provide your personal information directly to third parties for the purpose of serving you advertisements or for identifying other people to whom advertisements should be served. In some jurisdictions these activities might be considered targeted advertising.
Some jurisdictions require that we describe the categories of personal information we collect, disclose for a business purpose, and share with third parties. We do not “sell” your personal information for money. As discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies for purposes of targeted advertising.

Please note, not all of the rights described above are absolute, and they do not apply in all circumstances. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request because the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We will not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law.
As required by law, we will require you to prove your identity. We may conduct an identity verification by phone call, email or via other secure means. Depending on your request, we may ask for information such as your name, the last flight booked with us, or the date of your last purchase from us. We may also ask you to provide a signed declaration confirming your identity. Following a request, we will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you in our files.
Authorized Agents
In some circumstances, residents of certain states may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on their behalf. The authorized agent is required to submit a valid power of attorney and complete the affidavit made available on our
online portal.
Note that we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized to act on behalf of another individual.
How We Protect and Retain Personal Information
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
Our website permits you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.
We retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.
Cookie Policy
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. We use cookies in order to improve your online experience and to facilitate effective site administration. Cookies enable us to keep track of your reservation as you book on our site. They also allow us to recognize guests who have saved their info with us when they visit, and to provide those guests with their account information. If you save your info with Spirit or book on our site, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our site and what you book. If you have not saved your info with us or booked from our site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us to serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and
promotions.
Through our use of cookies, we track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to visiting
www.spirit.com.
Keeping track of the site you came from prior to visiting
www.spirit.com
can help us to improve our site design.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Web browser. However, if you turn off cookies, we may not be able to track your reservation, which means you may be unable to book on our site. Also, we may not be able to recognize you as a guest who has saved information with us.
We allow certain third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (“behavioral advertising” or “targeted advertising”). If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site.
As discussed in the Your Choices section above, if you would like to opt-out of online targeted advertising, you can adjust your choices by clicking the cookie icon button.  You may opt-out of other forms of targeted advertising by submitting a request through our
online portal
as described in that section.
California Notice of Financial Incentive
We offer our customers a loyalty program (
Free Spirit
)
that provides certain perks, such as rewards and special promotions. We may also provide other programs, such as sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other similar promotional campaigns (collectively, the “Programs”). When you sign up for one of our Programs, we will ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the Program.
You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms. Visit the
terms and conditions page
of each Program to view full details, including how to join.

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
