GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY
The app you downloaded from the store was developed by me, Daniel Viktorin. I always respect the privacy of every individual who uses the app. This Privacy Policy explains the personal information gathered throughout the app.
The app doesn't gather any sensitive personal information itself. It does not require any registration and doesn't collect sensitive information such as names, payment methods, credit card credentials, etc.
Only if you want to contact me for any reason, I may require some basic information about you (name, surname, email). You can provide this information yourself, or I can try to find you through basic app store statistics (with a very limited extent). Please note that any information I am able to find or that you provide will never be shared with any third party!
The app uses analytics services to gather basic anonymous app usage analytics to identify possible gameplay bottlenecks, and ad services that collect at least IP address and advertising ID to provide relevant ads.
All of these services help keep the game alive and up to date.
