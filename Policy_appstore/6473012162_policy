Note that this right may only apply to automated information which you initially provided consent for the Group to use or where the Group used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where the Group is relying on consent to process your personal data for direct marketing purposes: However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. All marketing communications will contain information about how to opt-out and electronic communications will have a direct link to unsubscribe. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
