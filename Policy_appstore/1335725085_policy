Purpose of the Tracking App
As a participant in an event, that allows tracking using our tracking service, you can decide whether you want to be tracked during the run.
Tracking means that we will display your current position on the course using the corresponding GPS data from your mobile phone on the course map. So your family, friends and other interested parties can track where you are at any given point of the run.
While completing the registration for the event you decide whether you want to be tracked or not. If you decide to be tracked, you will receive a login which consists of your last name and a registration ID. This login is only valid for the selected event.
The people who are interested to track your position within the race can select you from the published list of participants and will be able to track your current position on the course map.
added 06.08.2020
In so-called "virtual races", the "Twin Map Mode" can be used to display both, the virtual position of the participant on the respective original track of the event and the actual position of the participant.
At the end of the race, you actively switch off the tracking.
How and when location data is collected
At a time of your choice (ideally in good time before the start of the race) you log in to the app with your login and actively start tracking by pressing the "start tracking" button. The app will then start collecting and transmit position data until you stop the tracking by pressing the "stop tracking" button.
The collection of location data continues also when the app is closed or not in use ("background location access"). This allows you to turn the display off and/or put the device into your pocket during your race - and you will still be actively tracked. Your position will only be collected during the event period and when you have actively started tracking by yourself.

Recording of this information
We only store the above information for as long as we need it to display the position on the course map during the event. After the event, the data will be combined for statistical purposes (how many participants have been tracked, ...) and the individual data will be deleted.
Transfer of data to third parties
As already mentioned under "Purpose of the Tracking App", "third parties" may be interested in your position within the race. For this purpose, result data will be transmitted to the display function of the app or the result service on the internet via API. This only includes the position of the participant, not the raw data mentioned above
User Rights
Users of the Tracking App are entitled to know at any time whether their personal data has been saved and may contact the responsible body to find out about the content and origin of the recorded data, check its correctness, request its completion, deletion, updating, correction or transformation into an anonymous format or the blocking of data stored unlawfully, as well as to oppose its processing for legitimate reasons. Requests should be sent to the responsible body using the contact details given above.
This application does not support "do not track" requests by web browsers.
Please refer to the respective  privacy policy to find out whether a third party provider follows the do not track protocol.
