        by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account
        various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length
        of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our products or services, the impact on the services we
        provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and
