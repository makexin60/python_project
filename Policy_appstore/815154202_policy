The GoodSAM Data Protection: (GDPR compliance)
We take your data protection extremely seriously. We are registered with the Information Commissioners Office (no: ZA094052) and our technology team take the security of our data and servers very seriously.

In short, we will not sell your data to any third party.
However, the use of the App clearly requires some information to be shared in an emergency.
As an Alerter
- triggering an alert will inform the nearest responders (who accept the alert) of your name, your location and, if you have registered any pre-existing medical conditions you may have (for example epilepsy). Under no other circumstances is any of this data shared.
As a Responder
- we are currently integrating with a number of ambulance services. Your data will not be available to them, except if you are closest to an incident and there is an agreement between your parent organisation (e.g. St John Ambulance) and the regional ambulance service. If such an agreement is in place, and only in the event of a nearby emergency, the ambulance service may be able to see a very limited data set to alert you to the incident.
