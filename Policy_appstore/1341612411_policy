Ensuring our advertisements match the potential interest of users, tracking the efficiency of ads and optimising the effectiveness of our campaigns. We use Conversion APIs provided by Meta, Google and LinkedIn. An API is a software intermediary allowing two applications to talk to each other, when using a conversion API, we allow our server to communicate with these third-party servers.
Where you consent to “Targeting technologies” on our website, we collect information about your usage of our website from our server logs and share this information with these third parties for the abovementioned purposes. We also share what we call “offline” data, which is information we collected from our interactions with you that took place outside of our website and can help us understanding your entire experience with Sage. This data includes your hashed contact details, as well as information about your organisation and information about your interactions with Sage (e.g. whether you are interested in a product, which product it is, how interested you are).
When using the Meta Conversion API, Sage is a joint controller of personal data with Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Block J, Serpentine Avenue, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Meta”) for the purpose of creating, displaying and improving targeted ads.
We have concluded a joint-controllership of personal data agreement with Meta
which can be accessed here
, to determine the respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under the UK and EU General Data Protection Regulations (together “GDPR”) with regard to the joint processing of data.
Under this agreement, Sage and Meta have agreed that Meta would be responsible for enabling data subject rights of individuals with regards to the personal data stored by Meta after the joint processing.

7. Profiling and automated decision making
Profiling
Profiling activities consist of using personal data of individuals to predict their interests and likely behaviours. This is usually carried out using behavioural information and, amongst other uses, helps us to inform our decisions about marketing audiences. This allows us to send the right message to the right audience.
We may use personal data generated when you use our Solutions and Websites to improve them, and give you the best service and experience. This means that we may use personal data (including data collected using cookies and similar technologies) to evaluate and predict your personal preferences and interests. Please note that this is subject to your consent where required by applicable law.
We may conduct profiling activities to
:
support you and personalise the communications we send in relation to our Solutions where permitted by applicable law and in line with your preferences
;
deliver advertising, marketing (including in-Solution messaging) or information which may be useful to you, based on your use of Solutions (considering your preferences as required)
; and
provide you with location-based services (for example location relevant content) where we collect geo-location data.
Please be aware that, in connection with the purposes above, we may use the personal data of your customers, suppliers, employees, and other individuals, whose personal data you input into our Websites or Solutions.
Automated decision-making
We do not conduct any automated decision-making with a significant or legal effect, or otherwise, about you or any individuals.
8. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Sage is committed to innovation and is constantly evaluating new ways to improve its Solutions and develop new ones. Using Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”) allows us to improve our Solutions, giving you access to new, functionalities and automated features (e.g. automatic processing of invoices).
What is ML
?
ML is a type of AI which uses data and algorithms to recognise patterns, drawing inspiration from the way humans learn. It provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. It usually works with ML models, which are programs trained to recognise patterns in previously unseen data sets.
How do we use ML
?
Sage uses ML in some Solutions and may process personal data listed in Section 5(9), “
Data processed using Solutions”
,
to deliver these ML powered services. For the purposes of delivering ML powered services, personal data is generally used for the purpose of
:
(1) Building an ML model, and continuously training it
We build and train ML models using data including personal data, so they can perform the task they have been designed to perform. For example, to design a service allowing the automatic processing of invoices, we would create an ML model designed to recognise specific data fields in an invoice and train this ML model on a number of invoices so it can learn where these fields are located and what they are likely to contain. This ML model would then continually be updated and trained based on new invoices. The purpose of this processing is to create an accurate ML model and continuously ensure its accuracy.
(2) Providing the Solution
Personal data entered in the Solution is consumed by the ML model to deliver the service it has been programmed to deliver. For example, an ML model designed to automatically process invoices would, once trained, be applied to new invoices to automatically recognise fields and populate them into a Sage Solution.
The purpose of our use of AI and ML at Sage is not to make decisions about individuals. Our purpose is to automate manual and time-consuming processes for the benefit of our customers and other parties.
9. The Sage Network
Sage has created a trusted network, the
Sage Network
, with the purpose of interconnecting our Solutions, as well as our partner solutions. The aim of the Sage Network is to provide additional,  innovative and integrated Solutions to you (the “Sage Network Services”), to help automate your workflows and improve your customer/user experience. For this purpose, data inputted into our Solutions, and listed in in Section 5(9), “
Data processed using Solutions
”, may be shared with other Solutions and platforms (together the “Sage Network Platform”), to facilitate provision of the Sage Network Services.
Sage is mostly acting on behalf of its customers in the context of the Sage Network (as a data processor under European Union – “EU”- and UK data protection laws), and the processing of personal data to provide Sage Network Services is covered by our
Data Protection Agreement
.
Data processed in the Sage Network Platform may however be processed by Sage for the following purposes (as a data controller under EU and UK data protection laws)
:
To build and feed ML models, as described in section 8, “
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
”
;
To provide ML powered services, as described in section 8, “
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
”
;
To purchase data sets from third parties, in order to improve accuracy of data held in the Sage Network Platform
;
To carry out research and development activities to improve our Solutions based on data ingested by the Sage Network Platform.
Processing of personal data by Sage as a data controller under EU and UK data protection laws in the context of the Sage Network will be carried out in accordance with this privacy notice.
10. Mobile data
We may obtain personal data through mobile applications that you or your users install on mobile devices to access and use our Websites or Solutions, or which you or your users use to provide other services related to that mobile application (for example, to sync information from our Solution with that mobile application).
These mobile applications may be our own Solutions or be provided by third parties. Where the mobile application is operated by a third party, you must read that third party’s own privacy notice which applies to your use of that third party mobile application. We are not responsible for those third party mobile applications or the use of your personal data by those third parties.
Mobile applications may provide us with personal data related to your use of that mobile application and / or our Websites or Solutions accessed through that mobile application. We may use this personal data to provide and improve the mobile application or our own Website or Solution. For example, activity undertaken within a mobile application may be logged for review.
You can configure application privacy settings on your mobile device, but this may affect the performance the application and the way it interacts with our Websites and Solutions.
11. How long do  we keep personal data for?
We retain personal data about you during and after termination of your relationship with us. This data is held and used for as long as permitted for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention and legitimate business purposes, in accordance with our internal Sage policies. For more information on the retention of personal data, please contact the Sage Privacy Office at
globalprivacy@sage.com
.
12. How is  personal data shared?
Sometimes we may need to share your personal data with third parties.  This will usually be because you have asked us to, we are required to by law, or because a third party integrates with our Solution or provides us or you with a service. You will find in the table below a list of third parties with which we may share your personal data and why.

16. If you are based in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland
Key data protection laws
The key data protection laws in the United Kingdom are the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.
The key data protection laws in the Republic of Ireland are the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the S.I. No. 336/2011 - European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011.
Controllers and processors
This privacy notice describes our processing of your personal data in our capacity as a “data controller” under applicable law in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. A data controller decides how and why your personal data is processed.  Depending on the country in which you are located, a different Sage company may be the data controller of your personal data. You will find
here
the list of all Sage affiliate companies, by region.
Where we process personal data on behalf of another individual, for example our customers, partners, or other parties, we do not decide how and why to process that personal data. In those instances, we are a “data processor” under applicable law rather than a data controller. Where we are a data processor of your personal data, we use it in accordance with the data controller’s instructions to us. Those instructions include the terms and conditions applicable to the product or service you or your employer are using, and our Data Processing Agreement
here
which forms part of those terms.
If we are a data processor of your personal data, then you should also read the relevant data controller’s privacy notice. Make sure that you familiarise yourself with the privacy notice of your own employer, accountant, business, or other organisation that you have a direct relationship with, and which may share your personal data with Sage.
European Union representative
European Union (“EU”) data protection laws require non-EU organisations to have a representative in the EU. The role of the EU representative is to be the point of contact for individuals and authorities for all EU member states.
In the UK, we have appointed Sage Global Services (Ireland) Limited as our EU representative. Sage Global Services (Ireland) Limited’s contact details are
:
Number One Central Park
Leopards town
Dublin 18
662898
Ireland
You can also contact
globalprivacy@sage.com
if you have any questions about or for our EU representative.
Your data protection rights
If you are based within the UK or the Republic of Ireland, you have the following data protection rights
:
the right to be informed about the processing of your personal data
;
the right to obtain access to your personal data
;
the right to have your personal data rectified or erased, or to place restrictions on processing your personal data
;
the right to object to the processing of your personal data e.g., for direct marketing purposes or where the processing is based on our legitimate interests
;
the right to have any personal data you provided to us electronically returned to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or sent directly to another company, where technically feasible (this is known as ‘data portability’)
;
where the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, the right to withdraw that consent subject to legal or contractual restrictions
;
the right to object to any decisions based solely on the automated processing of your personal data, including profiling
; and
the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority responsible for data protection matters in your location. For the UK, this is the
Information Commissioner’s Office
(ICO). For the Republic of Ireland, this is the
Data
Protection Commissioner
(DPC).
Please note that in some circumstances the exercise of the above rights may be limited by legal restrictions and exemptions. If relevant, we will explain this when responding to a request to exercise data protection rights.
If you think we hold any personal data about you which is incorrect or if there are any changes to your personal data, please let us know so that we can keep our records accurate and up to date.
If you wish to exercise your data protection rights as an individual, please access the
globalprivacy@sage.com
.
If you do not want us to use your personal data for purposes set out in our privacy notice, we may not be able to provide you with access to all or parts of our Website or Solutions.
International transfer of personal data
Personal data in EU member states and the UK is protected by data protection laws, but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal data in the same way.  You can find a list of countries that the European Commission considers provide an equivalent level of data protection to that which exists within the European Economic Area (EEA) (“Adequate countries”)
here
.
Our Website and some of our Solutions, or parts of them, may be hosted outside the EEA or UK, which means that we may transfer personal data to third countries which do not have an EU or UK adequacy determination in some circumstances.  In addition, we may use service providers located outside the EEA or UK to help us provide our Websites, Solutions or other services to you and this means that we may transfer your personal data to these regions.
We take steps to ensure that where your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA or the UK, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that data in accordance with applicable data protection laws. All Sage Group companies are subject to an internal  Personal Data Protection governance policy and related procedures designed to protect personal data in accordance with EU, EU member state and UK data protection laws. In each case, such transfers are made in accordance with applicable data protection laws and may be based on the use of (i) the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA, or (ii) the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement and/or the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the UK Addendum for transfers of personal data outside the UK.
