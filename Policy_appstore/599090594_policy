About Spitcast
In the summer of '89, I took my first surf trip. My best friend and I packed our surfboards into my mom's Volvo Station Wagon; along with a copy of Bank Wright's classic "Surfing California". We drove the coast from
Santa Cruz
to
Imperial Beach
, stopping at what felt like every single surf spot; though we were nowhere close. We mind-surfed perfect six-inch peelers at
Campus Point
, were sandblasted by wind torn
Silver Strand
, ate the famous burgers at
Jalama Beach
, and then finally scored south swell peaks near the pier in
Huntington Beach
.
That was the first of countless coastal California road trips. Guide books gave way to hunches and hearsay, which led to diaries, databases, charts, then algorithms. Childhood in
Santa Cruz
, college in
Santa Barbara
, a career in
San Francisco
, and in-laws in
San Clemente
have meant countless opportunties to explore this coast. Spitcast is the culmination of all that. Lots of research guiding key heuristics, plus a little machine learning (I guess it's AI now). My predictions score me great waves all the time. I hope it blesses you with a similar bounty.
Spitcast provides accurate surf forecasts throughout California. Give it a look. Go for a surf. You'll see what I mean.
