Privacy Policy
Appme Studio provides several software applications on the
Apple App Store that include iConverter,Video & Photo Compressor("Application") for
download and use. It is  Appme Studio's policy to respect your
privacy regarding any information we may collect while using one of
these Applications.
Gathering Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data
When using any Application created by  Appme
Studio,  Appme Studio may receive and store certain
personally non-identifiable information, for example device
operating system version, device type, and crash logs. Such
information, which is gathered using various technologies such as
third-party analytics tools, cannot be used to specifically
identify a user.  Appme Studio only collects such information
to better understand users of its Applications and how to better
serve them.  Appme Studio may also gather
personally-identifying information which is described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
When using any Application created by  Appme
Studio, users may interact with an Application in ways that may
require the user to send personally-identifying information
to  Appme Studio. The amount and type of
information gathered depends on the nature of the interaction. For
example, you might contact  Appme Studio by sending
an email, and  Appme Studio will use that data to
provide an answer to your question or resolve your specific issue.
In each case,  Appme Studio collects
personally-identifying information only insofar as is necessary or
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of an interaction. A user can
always refuse to apply such personally-identifying information, but
that may prevent them from resolving an issue or using features of
an Application.
Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information
Appme Studio does not rent or sell any of your
personally-identifying information it collects to
anyone.  Appme Studio does disclose potentially
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organizations that need to know that
information in order to process it on  Appme
Studio's behalf, and have agreed not to disclose it. Other than its
employees, contractors, and affiliated
organizations,  Appme Studio will only disclose
personally-identifying information when required to do so by law or
when Appme Studio believes in good faith that it is reasonably
necessary to protect the rights or property of Appme Studio, urgent
circumstances to protect the safety of users of its Applications or
the public, or to protect against legal liability.
Integrating Third Party Services
An Application created by  Appme Studio may
offer the ability to share content created with an Application to
online third party services, such as social networking services
("Third Party Services"). An Application may ask you to provide
your username and password for the relevant Third Party Services.
By providing this information you are allowing an Application to
pass your log-in information to a service to share content created
with an Application. When you enable a Third Party Service account
in an Application, it will collect your login information and other
relevant information necessary to enable an Application to access
that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third
Party Service. Please remember that the manner in which Third Party
Services use, store, and disclose your information is governed
solely by the policies of such third parties, and Appme Studio shall
have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or
other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled within
an Application.
Privacy Policy Changes
Appme Studio may change its Privacy Policy from
time to time, and at  Appme Studio's sole
discretion. Flambe Studios encourages users to check this web page
for any changes to its Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued
use of any Application created by Flambe Studios will constitute
acceptance of such change.

ChrisInc and Third Party Software Application Developers (“Application Partners”) that provide the Chris Sharing Outlets, Chris  Explore Feed and Chris Promotional Feed (collectively the “Chris Enabled Service”) in their software applications (“Chris Enabled Applications”), provide several software applications on the Apple App Store, Google Play/Android Store and Windows/Windows Phone Store (the “Applications”) for download and use in connection with photographs, images and/or videos taken by the User (“Content”). The Applications and the Chris Enabled Service in Chris Enabled Applications also interact with certain social media platforms (each a “Platform”) that allows users of the Application (“Users”) to interact with the applicable Platform to modify, distribute, share, and store their Content (“Sharing”). It is ChrisInc’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while using one of these Applications.
Gathering Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data
When using any Application created by ChrisInc and/or the Chris Enabled Service in Chris Enabled Applications, ChrisInc may receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information, for example device operating system version, device type, and crash logs.

Certain functions of the Application and the Chris Enabled Service in Chris Enabled Applications may allow Sharing of Content on Platforms. Users should be aware that this involves two different types of data than are covered above. First, in order to access and integrate with your Platform, the User will need to be logged into his or her Platform account (e.g. Facebook account, Twitter Account, Vine Account, Instagram account, etc) and will need to authorize ChrisInc., to access the account by collecting Oauth Tokens, handles, or device identifiers that are used by the Platform to uniquely identify the User.

Users may control and change their settings by logging into their accounts with each Platform.

If you post personal information in any Content, you acknowledge that we have no control over this use of your personal information and, as such, cannot be responsible for it. Please remember that the manner in which a Platform uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed solely by the applicable privacy policy posted at such Platform. ChrisInc shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that may be enabled within an Application and/or the Chris Enabled Service in Chris Enabled Applications.

Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information
ChrisInc does not rent or sell any of your personally-identifying information it collects to anyone. ChrisInc does disclose potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on ChrisInc’s behalf, and have agreed not to disclose it.

Integrating Third Party Services
An Application created by ChrisInc and the Chris Enabled Service in Chris Enabled Applications may offer the ability to share content created with an Application to online third party services, such as social networking services (“Third Party Services”).

California Users: Your California Privacy Rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. ChrisInc has such a policy in place. Despite any indicated preferences opt-out, ChrisInc may still send service related communications.

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Reen Game Player", "we", "us", or "our" refer to Reen Game Player and all of its subsidiaries.
Your privacy is important to Reen Game Player. We designed our Privacy Policy to cover how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information. Please familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
Our Privacy Policy applies only to the collection; use and disclosure of personal information that you may decide to provide to us in your use of our applications for mobile platforms or devices and our web applications accessible on third party social networking services. Any and all of our Reen Game Player Applications, are referred to herein as our "Services".
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services and on the Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update the "Last Updated Date" in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.
Please visit this page periodically to remain up-to-date as to any Privacy Policy changes. Take a moment now to read the following to learn about our information collection practices that may impact you as a registered user with full access to our Services or a non-registered user of our Services (each a " Reen Game Player User "). For information regarding the collection and use of Personal Information (defined below) from children under 14 years old, see the Section below, entitled "Our Policy Toward Children".
We Collect Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information
In the course of using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, and email address (" Personal Information "). We will collect, use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
We also collect non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not permit direct association with you or any specific individual (" Non-Identifying Information "). Non-Identifying Information is aggregated and used to help improve our Services and Third Party Mobile Applications (defined below) by providing a better way to understand the Reen Game Player User experience with the level of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific Applications or specific Third-Party Mobile Applications. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose Non-Identifying Information for any purpose; details provided in this Privacy Policy about what Non-Identifying Information we collect currently, and how we use, transfer and disclose such Non-Identifying Information concern only how such information is collected and used today.
Both Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information may be used alone or in the aggregate with information collected from other Reen Game Player Users. Our primary objective in collecting any Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information is to provide you with a superior and personally relevant user experience.
How we use your Personal Information
Your Personal Information may be used, for instance:
•  To help us to develop, deliver, and improve our Services and advertising;
•  To recommend products of interest directly to you;
•  For market research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community of Reen Game Player Users;
◦    For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with announcements, and promotional materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a "Promotion") via our Services.
▪    If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "Changing or Removing Information" below for further information.)
•  To allow us to keep you posted regarding our latest Service announcements, software updates, and upcoming events;
•  To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or other Service-specific policies. Because this information is important to your interactions with Reen Game Player, you may not opt out of receiving these communications;
•  To audit and analyse data to improve our Services and customer communications.
How we use your Personal Information
One of the instances when we collect your Personal Information is in connection with your registration on our Services.
If you are a Reen Game Player User, you can register either via an Reen Game Player Application or via a third-party application utilizing our Services (" Third Party Mobile Application ") that was designed for mobile telephones or other mobile devices by a third-party publisher (" Third Party Publisher ").
In connection with registration of Reen Game Player Users on our Services, we collect Personal Information which may include your email address, as well as information on mobile device type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier ("Device ID"), Internet Protocol ("IP") address and geo location, as applicable. We use your Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand your use of our Services, or the Third Party Mobile Application that you may choose to access through our Services.
Related to this information collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to other Third-Party Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks or other ad fulfillment metrics. Our use of your Device ID does not enable us to identify you personally, and we do not store this information in connection with your Reen Game Player User account information.
You may also be asked explicitly to provide Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information anytime that you are in contact with Reen Game Player company. If your Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information is shared with our affiliates, such sharing will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Cookies & Other Technologies
As is standard practice, we use "cookies" to help us study traffic patterns and understand the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that we send to your computer’s or mobile device's browser. Other types of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection with our Services are only used to obtain browser-specific information. For example, we do not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies we use can reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular, how much time Reen Game Player Users are spending there, and how they are interacting with the content on such pages.
You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of our Services due to limited functionality.
Some of our Services, including email messaging, use "click-through URLs" linked to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics, Services usability and other measures of Reen Game Player User engagement.
We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively " Pixel Tags ") in connection with our Services and to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
When you use our Services or Third-Party Mobile Applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser or the applicable Service or Third-Party Mobile Application sends ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date stamp, clickstream data and other statistics. We use this information to monitor, analyze and understand trends, for technical administration of Services and Third-Party Mobile Applications, and to gather demographic information about our Reen Game Player User base as a whole. We, and Third Party Publishers may use this information for product and services improvements, and in marketing and advertising services.
BY CLICKING ON THE "SIGN UP" BUTTON, WHERE APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ON YOUR DEVICE.
With Third Parties for Industry Analysis
In addition to sharing aggregated Non-Identifying Information with Third Party Publishers, we may also share aggregated Non-Identifying Information with advertisers and ad networks (" Advertising Entities ") with whom we have strategic relationships. Unless you specifically opt in to share your Personal Information, the information that we share with these third parties will only be used in the form of Non-Identifying Information to support user trend analyses and demographic profiling. Some Third Party Publishers and Advertising Entities also act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, so in those cases we will share your information as described below.
With Preferred Partners
We may share your username, email address and Device ID (collectively, " Specific Shared Data ") with certain of our Third Party Publishers and other business partners ("Preferred Partners ") for those parties to assist us with providing you with the aspect of the Services for which you provided such Specific Shared Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data to provide you with information and marketing materials about Third Party Mobile Applications and other products and services in order, for example, to further enhance your use of our Services and to augment your gaming and social networking experience generally. In addition, in the event of a user inquiry concerning Third Party Publishers or Third Party Applications, we may send Specific Shared Data as well as the inquiry to a Preferred Partner to address the inquiry.
We only share such information with Preferred Partners pursuant to an agreement by which the Preferred Partner is under obligations not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. You may contact us by any of the means provided in the "Contacting Us" section below to request not to have such information provided to Preferred Partners, understanding, however, that if such information is not shared with Preferred Partners it may affect your ability to use or access portions of the Services.
Some Preferred Partners also act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, and in those cases we may also share Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information as described below.

Through use of such services’ application programming interfaces (APIs) we can receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any.
Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other services you use.
User Content
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to create content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly.

If you remove information that you have created on the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.
With our Service Providers
Disclosure of your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information may also occur where we engage or employ service providers, vendors or other third party entities to facilitate provision of our Services (each a " Service Provider ") (e.g., without limitation, improvement of our Services’ features, user account authentication, promotion and marketing, administration, analytics, virtual currency transactions, crowd-sourcing, cloud storage and other related services), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service Providers may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

5. Do Not Track Disclosures Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our sites do not currently process or respond to "do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. Certain third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect information about your online activities over time and across websites. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. Information about how to opt out from your data being used by third parties can be found above under " Information collected by automated means."

We may retain other information that is not personally identifiable for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
7. How We Protect Personal Information We use various efforts intended to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information collected through our Services.
