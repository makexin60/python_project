Sophos Group Privacy Notice
Sophos Group Privacy Notice
General
This is the privacy notice of Sophos Limited and its subsidiaries.
This document was last updated on 11 December 2024.
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personal data. Please read the following privacy notice to understand how we collect and use your personal data, for example when you contact us, visit or use one of our websites, mobile applications, portals, or other parts of our network (each a “Site”), or use our products and services, regardless of how you access them. This privacy notice also explains the rights available to you in respect of your personal data.

What personal data do we collect, how do we collect it, and why?
Data that you provide voluntarily to us
When you use our Site, products or services, or you otherwise communicate with us, we may ask you to provide certain personal data voluntarily, including but not limited to your name, company position, postal address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address, credit card or other payment details, age or date of birth, account usernames, passwords, or gender. For example, we may ask you to provide some or all of this personal data when you register an account with us, subscribe to our marketing communications, purchase products or services, and/or submit enquiries to us. We use this information to create and administer your account, send you marketing communications, provide you with the products and services you request, and to respond to your enquiries. In general, the personal data that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal data.
Data collected automatically
When you use our Site, products, or services, we may collect certain data automatically from your computers or devices (including mobile devices). The data we collect automatically may include your IP address (explained further below), device type, operating system details, unique device identification numbers (including mobile advertising identifiers), browser-type, browser language, operating system, geographic location (as explained further under the heading “
Location information
”) and other technical information. We may also collect data about how your device has interacted with our Site, products or services, including the pages or features accessed and links clicked, the amount of time spent on particular pages, mouse hovers, the date and time of the interaction, error logs, referring and exit pages and URLs, and similar information. Collecting this data enables us to better understand the visitors who use our Site, products, and services, including where they come from and what features are of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes, and to improve the quality, relevance, and security of our Site, products and services.
For example, every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet - its IP address. This log tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser your machine used to view the pages. This data is used for statistical purposes as well as to help customize the user experience as you browse the Site and subsequently interact with Sophos. This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest, which pages are not being requested, and how many people are visiting the Site in total. It also helps us to determine which products and services may be of specific interest to you. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the terms and conditions for use of the Site.
Some of the data may be collected automatically using tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “
Cookies and similar tracking technology
”.
Data that we obtain from third party sources
From time to time, we may receive personal data about you from third party sources (including without limitation recruitment agencies, credit check agencies, agencies providing compliance checks, lead generation providers, resellers, and other partners who sell our products and services to you), but only where such third parties have confirmed that they have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal data to us.
The types of information we collect from third parties include contact details, credit history, and order information, and we use the information we receive from these third parties to carry out compliance checks required under applicable law (such as anti-bribery and corruption checks), make credit decisions, maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you, and market our products and services to you.
We also receive information from other members of the industry that forms part of or otherwise helps us to develop, test, and enhance our own product offering (for example spam lists, malicious URL lists, and sample viruses), some of which could contain personal data (where permitted by applicable law).
We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties.
Data collected through our products and services
We use data that we collect from products and services for the purposes for which you provided it, usage and audience counts, monitoring the performance and effectiveness of the products/services, monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions, enabling compatibility with third party operating systems/products/services, planning future roadmap strategy, planning product/service/feature lifecycles and retirements, conducting spam, threat and other scientific research, developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services, troubleshooting product issues, generating statistics, reporting, and trend analysis. This may include incidental personal data (for example usernames, machine IDs, domain names, IP addresses, file names, and file paths).
Our products and services may collect further additional personal data about you beyond the data described in this privacy policy, or use your personal data in ways that are different to or in addition to those described in this privacy policy. We provide a
Product Privacy Information page
that explains how our products and services collect and use personal data. Please review the relevant section of the Product Privacy Information page for the product or service you are using to ensure that you are fully informed.
Cookies and similar tracking technology
A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on your machine and later retrieve it.
Our Site, products, and services may use cookies, unique device identifiers (like Apple ID For Advertisers on iOS devices, and Android Advertising ID on Android devices), and other tracking technologies (collectively, "Cookies") to distinguish you from other users and better serve you when you return to the Site, product, or service, and to monitor and analyse the usage of the Site, product, or service. Cookies also enable us and our third party partners to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the onsite or in-product experience through content, features, and advertisements.
We, along with our service providers, may also use other Internet technologies, such as Flash technologies, Web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Site, product, or service, as well as serve you ads and personalize/customize your experience when you are using our Site, product, or service and/or when you are on other websites where those cookies can be accessed.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party) other than as described in this privacy policy, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “
Contact
” heading.
With whom might we share your personal data
We may transfer or disclose your personal data to the following categories of recipients:
to
our group companies
, third party services providers, suppliers, agents, and other organisations who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Site, products, or services), or who otherwise process personal data on our behalf for purposes that are described in this privacy policy or notified to you when we collect your personal data (such as advertising, sweepstakes, analytics, research, customer support, fraud prevention, and legal services);;

to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal data save where we need to do so in order to enforce this privacy policy, our End User License Agreement, our rights generally, or where required or permitted by applicable local or foreign law.
Whenever we share personal data, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. This may include without limitation aggregating or de-identifying information so that it is not intended to be used by the third party to identify you.
Data Transfers
As a global company, we and our service providers operate, and our Site, products, and services are accessed from, all over the world. When you give us personal data, that data may be used, processed, or stored anywhere in the world, including in countries that have data protection laws that are different to the country in which you reside.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, these include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of personal data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal data they process from the European Economic Area in accordance with European Union data protection law. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers, and further details can be provided upon request by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “
Contact
” heading.
Data retention
We retain personal data we collect from you for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a product or service you have requested, to ensure that transactions can be processed, settled, refunded, charged back, or to identify fraud), or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or regulatory requirements. Even if you close your account, we will retain certain information in order to meet our obligations.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either securely destroy, erase, delete or anonymise it, or if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

The Site, the products, and the services are not intended for persons under the age of 16. By using the Site, product, or service, you hereby represent that you are at least 16 years old.
Automated decision-making
In some instances, our use of your personal data may result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.
Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review. For example, our products and services use automated decisions to determine whether a domain, URL, or IP address is sending spam or malicious content in order to protect our customers from unwanted or undesirable content. We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal data is subject to automated decision-making, including controlled product releases and regular quality assessments.
When we make an automated decision about you (for example if we block a domain, URL, or IP address used by you), you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contact us using the contact details provided under the “

Sophos Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Privacy Data Sheet
Sophos Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Privacy Data Sheet
The purpose of this datasheet is to provide Sophos customers with information they need to understand how our offering affects their privacy considerations. In this document, we provide information about MDR data handling practices, including personal information collection, use and storage.
PRODUCT SUMMARY
Built on our Intercept X Endpoint technologies, Sophos MDR fuses machine learning technology and expert analysis for improved threat hunting and detection, deeper investigation of alerts, and targeted actions to eliminate threats with speed and precision.
INFORMATION PROCESSED BY SOPHOS MDR
Sophos processes the following types of information as part of the MDR service:
CustomerID
MachineID
UserID
Sophos Intercept X Advanced with XDR Telemetry and/or Sophos XDR Sensor Telemetry
In addition, MDR (and XDR) customers may optionally configure additional Sophos and third-party integrations as part of their service. Sophos processes the following types of information as part of the MDR service only when optionally configured by the customer:
Sophos XG Firewall Telemetry
Sophos Email Telemetry
Sophos Cloud Optix Telemetry
Telemetry from configured third-party integrations
Security events from Sophos and third-party data sources are used to generate MDR detections, and some detections generate MDR Cases. These cases are assigned to an analyst for investigation. Sophos’ case management system tracks and audits all actions taken by the analyst. Integrated systems communicate with Sophos infrastructure using encrypted channels. Depending on the case complexity, an analyst may need to acquire more evidence from the endpoint to aid in the investigation and perform response actions to neutralize an active threat.
During the course of delivering the service and in the course of an investigation, Sophos may have access to the following information:
Full user information—including user credentials used to login to the endpoint
All files contained on the licensed endpoint
Network data associated with the licensed endpoint
All data contained within security events generated by configured third-party integrations
Depending on the case, where a specific file is part of suspicious activity, MDR analysts may open the file. However, in most instances, the MDR analyst will not open the file, but instead submit the file to SophosLabs for analysis purposes. In the majority of cases, these files are binary, PE files (Portable Executables) which do not contain private data.
MDR analysts will only process suspicious files for the purposes of providing evidence to support a case or send to SophosLabs for further analysis.
Sophos Engineering monitors the effectiveness of the product, planning future roadmap strategy and retirements, product development and enhancement, troubleshooting, generating statistics and reports.
Generative AI will be used to streamline MDR analyst workflows and improve service quality, primarily for datainvestigation, summarization, and classification.
WHERE IS SOPHOS MDR DATA PROCESSED
Telemetry from Sophos first-party products and Microsoft telemetry ingested via the Microsoft Graph Security API are processed in the region in which the customer account is provisioned. This region is selected at the time of on-boarding.
SOPHOS RAPID RESPONSE
Sophos Rapid Response offers lightning-fast assistance with identification and neutralization of active threats, delivered by an expert team of incident responders globally.
The Sophos Rapid Response service supports analysis of third-party log data, such as firewall logs, system logs, etc. to aid in triage and define remediation actions. These logs may contain private data, including but not limited to IP addresses, MAC addresses, Hostnames and UserIDs. This data is stored in dedicated customer folders, which can be accessed only by authorized Rapid Response incident responders. Data is deleted when the Rapid Response term ends.
PURPOSE OF INFORMATION PROCESSED BY SOPHOS MDR
Sophos processes the information noted above for the purpose of performing the service in accordance with the
Sophos End User Terms of Use
.
SUB-PROCESSORS
Sophos first-party data processed by MDR is hosted in Box and AWS data centers in the region(s) selected by the customer at the time of Sophos Central account creation. Visit our
Sub-processor listing
to find out more about sub-processors engaged by Sophos.
RETENTION
Sophos applies its retention policies to delete and purge data that is no longer needed for the purpose for which the personal data was originally collected.
By default, Sophos Central and MDR retain Sophos telemetry, third-party telemetry and Detections for 90 days. Customers who optionally choose to purchase the Central Data Storage – 1 yr Pack will have Sophos telemetry, third-party telemetry and Detections data retained in the Data Lake for 365 days. (Sophos Central alert, report, threat graph and audit data continue to be stored for the default 90 days). After these time frames, the data is deleted. Additionally, Sophos Central will store licensed Sophos endpoint telemetry and network telemetry from licensed XG firewalls using Central Firewall Reporting in Sophos Central for 7 days, or a longer timeframe based on the data retention option the customer has purchased. This data is available to be used by the customer to perform their own queries and investigations independently from the MDR or Rapid Response services. All customer data is deleted upon termination of the service.
Upon termination of the MDR service, access to the customer’s MDR interface in Sophos Central is disabled after a 30-day grace period. After this period, the MDR specific data, such as cases, reports, and detections, will be permanently deleted and unrecoverable, however a copy of detections associated with previous cases will be retained for 2 years on an AWS instance which is separate from Sophos Central.
SECURITY
Sophos secures your information by authenticating access via username and password based on managed Active Directory group membership coupled with multi-factor authentication.
The Sophos MDR platform has achieved SOC2 Type II certification and PCI DSS v3.2 attestation to demonstrate its strong security practices, policies and internal controls environment.
For information about the security protections used in the data centers where Sophos MDR data resides, visit the
AWS Security Documentation Center.
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
Sophos is committed to complying with data protection rules and protection of personal data processed by Sophos MDR. Sophos will access data only to enable it to provide the services you have signed up for and in the case of Sophos MDR, to identify security threats or to investigate suspicious activities that are indicative of attacks.
ACCESS
Customer Access
MDR customers have access to the Sophos Central customer portal to administer, configure and manage their estate and access information from licensed and configured Sophos solutions and third-party integrations.
Sophos Access
Access to information processed is restricted to Sophos engineers, and the MDR Operations team. When a support ticket is raised, the Sophos support team will access your account for purposes of troubleshooting and resolving issues.
Customer data is anonymized and may be accessed by SophosLabs or Sophos AI teams for threat research purposes to improve our ability to detect new threats. It is possible a file submission of suspicious files that may incidentally contain personal information. If these files are convicted as malicious, then they are treated as malware and will be blocked globally going forward. If suspicious files containing personal information are not convicted and are cleared as non-malicious, they are permanently deleted within 30 days.
MDR Operations has system level privileges on licensed endpoints, including ability to start and stop software, delete and read files and otherwise take any actions deemed necessary for the purpose of providing the service, according to the customers’ threat response mode preferences set in Sophos Central.
DISCLAIMER
The information contained in this privacy data sheet may change at any time and is only meant for general awareness. This MDR Privacy Data Sheet is not meant to constitute legal advice, warranty of fitness for a particular purpose or compliance with any applicable laws.
