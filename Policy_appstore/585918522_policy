California Privacy Rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law permits users of the Application that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the Contact Information provided below.
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) signed into law June 28, 2018 and entering into effect Jan. 1, 2020, California residents have certain rights and privileges. These rights include the:
Right to Know: the right to request disclosure of PII collected or sold.
Right to Deletion: the right to request deletion of PII collected from you.
*“Do Not Sell Right”: the right to opt-out of the sale of PII (if applicable).
Right to Sue for Security Breaches.
*We do not sell your PII to third parties and have no plans to do so in the future.
We reserve the right to ask for information verifying your identity and residency prior to disclosing any information to you or acting on your request.  Should we ask for verification, the information you provide to verify your identity and residency will be used only for that purpose, and all copies of this information in our possession will be destroyed when the process is complete. We strive to respond to your request within 30 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request, however.
21. To make inquiries, exercise any of your rights set out above, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your Data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your Data), please contact us via this e-mail address: support@triplogmileage.com.
22. If you are not satisfied with the way a complaint you make in relation to your Data is handled by us, you may be able to refer your complaint to the relevant data protection authority.

We will only transfer Data outside the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, e.g., by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, or by signing up to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, in the event that the organization in receipt of the Data is based in the United States of America.
26. To ensure that your Data receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate safeguards and procedures with the third parties we share your Data with. This ensures your Data is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with the Data Protection Laws.
