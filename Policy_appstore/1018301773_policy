Privacy Policy
The app is designed to protect your privacy online and does not collect any personal information.
Our app uses Apple's native Content Blocking API for ad blocking, which provides filters to Safari without accessing your browsing data. The optional video ad-blocking extension needs extended permission to operate, but its use is strictly confined to video websites, and it does not collect any data.
To facilitate subscription sharing across your devices and support our referral program, the app assigns an anonymous user ID.
