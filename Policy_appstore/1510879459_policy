To adapt to the state of your device, Labo Lado's apps may access device sensors such as gravity and acceleration to identify whether your device is in portrait or landscape mode or to allow you to control operations within the app through these sensors.

We do not associate user-uploaded content with any personal information and do not ensure that all uploaded content will be publicly displayed.

5. Links within the App

The app may contain external links to Labo Lado's website, the app store from which you purchased the app, or Labo Lado's social media profiles to provide you with more information about the Labo Lado company and its products and services. These links are only available in the "Parent" section (usually accessible by holding down for 3 seconds or solving a math problem in most apps).

6. Advertising

Labo Lado's apps do not contain any third-party advertisements.

Labo Lado may occasionally promote other apps within its apps. We strive to ensure that these links are placed in the parent section to protect children from clicking on them.

Labo Lado Android apps or HarmonyOS apps obtained from the Huawei AppGallery may include Huawei's HMS SDK, used for in-app payments.

The WeChat Pay SDK requires the acquisition of unique device identification codes, network information, and information about installed apps.

9. WeChat In-App Payments

WeChat in-app payments are implemented through WeChat's payment SDK. We generally do not store any WeChat information of users. The restoration of payments is achieved by checking whether the order number assembled from the user information returned by the SDK call is duplicated. If you encounter duplicate payments or are unable to restore payments, please send a screenshot of your order to our email [app@labolado.com](mailto:app@labolado.com) to apply for a refund.

10. Regarding WeChat Account Binding and Cancellation

Labo Lado's apps may offer the option to bind a WeChat account for certain features or services. If you choose to bind your WeChat account, we will only use the account information to authenticate and authorize your access to those features or services. You can choose to unbind your WeChat account at any time, which will remove any associated data from our systems.

11. Data Retention and Deletion

We will retain user data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. When we no longer need your data, we will securely delete or anonymize it.

12. Security

Labo Lado takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

13. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or through a notice within our apps before the changes become effective.
