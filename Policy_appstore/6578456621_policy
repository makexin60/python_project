Privacy Statement
Hey there! At Coffee & Fun, we’re not just about brewing innovative apps; we’re also serious about safeguarding your privacy. It's our promise to you: no sneaky data collection, no prying into your personal information. We’re in the business of creating fun, not tracking data.
Data Collection Across All Apps
Whether you’re using any of our apps, rest easy knowing we don't collect personal info, browsing histories, or any data from your device. We respect your privacy like we love our coffee – immensely and genuinely.
Data Usage
Our policy is simple – no data collection means nothing to use, store, or share. Your activities in all our apps stay right where they belong: with you.
Data Security
Imagine a vault. Now, think of our apps as vaults for your data. They operate in a self-contained universe within your device, with no data transmission or external storage. We’re all about keeping things secure and in your control.
Continuous Improvements
We're committed to constantly improving our apps. Any updates we roll out will focus on making your experience better and brighter, while our stance on privacy and data protection remains as firm as ever.
Third-Party Services? No, Thanks!
Our apps are free of third-party services that might peek into your data. We believe in a closed loop – just us, our apps, and the awesome you, with no external prying eyes.
Your Privacy is Our Priority
We get it – privacy is a big deal, and we treat it that way. When you use any of our apps, your information is as safe as a secret in a friend’s heart.
