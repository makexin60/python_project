Also, please note that in some jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area we will rely on consent as a lawful basis for processing personal information, even where consent is not specified as an applicable legal basis in the table above. If you want to understand more about the processing undertaken on the basis of consent in your jurisdiction, please use the details in the How to Contact us and Additional Information sections below.  Regardless of our legal basis for marketing, you have the right to prevent future marketing messages being sent directly to you at any time by contacting us at privacy@laerdal.com or by using the unsubscribe links contained in our emails or on the Websites. If you specifically consent to additional uses of your personal information, we use your personal information in a manner consistent with that consent.  Separately, your employer may collect consents from you for their own purposes as a data controller (see the following box).
Please note that if we need to process your personal information in order to enter into a contract with you, and you fail to provide the required personal information, we may not be able to enter into contracts or perform the contract with you.
Where you use the Services at the request of your employer, and we provide Services to your employer, we collect, use and share your personal information for the above purposes at the request of, and in accordance with the directions of your employer. Your employer is the data controller of your personal information for such purposes, and we are the data processor. Your employer has personal information protection policies and processes that may differ from the privacy statement you are currently reading, and we recommend that you read such policies before accessing or using the Services.
If you have yourself individually subscribed to the Services as a controller, we collect, use and share your personal information for the above purposes for and on your behalf and we are the processor of your personal information for such purposes.
We will not sell your personal information or share it with third parties for use in advertising or marketing of their products or services.
4. How We Share Information
We do not share personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement, or as described in other applicable privacy notices. We share personal information with:
Members of the Laerdal Group of Companies and its affiliates and subsidiaries for purposes provided in this Privacy Statement.
Service providers such as suppliers, consultants, professional advisers and other service providers act on our behalf in order to achieve processing purposes specified in this privacy statement.
Customers when we provide Services in the capacity of a service provider that process personal information on their behalf.
Third parties whose products and services are integrated into our Websites and Services in order to deliver desired functionalities.
Third party websites and social media networks when you directly engage with them so that Laerdal can advertise on their websites and networks.
Third parties involved in a business transaction that involve a merger, reorganization, dissolution or other significant business change.
Third parties when we believe that such personal information disclosure is instrumental to protect individuals’ vital interests.
Law enforcement and other public authorities in case we believe in good faith it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation or respond to a valid legal process.
Other third parties after receiving your consent. The category and brief description of activities carried out by those 3rd parties will be disclosed when obtaining your consent.
Other third parties as permitted by applicable laws and regulations such as tax authorities, data protection authorities and as required under medical devices regulations.
Where you use the Services at the request of your employer, and we provide Services to your employer, we share your personal information with your employer for certain purposes as data processor of your employer - see "
How We Use Personal Information
" above.
We use third-party service providers (for example, order fulfillment, website management, event management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery) to store and process your personal information in order to perform business functions on behalf of Laerdal.
Our service providers have entered into contracts with us that require them to follow our express instructions when processing your personal information and they must comply with appropriate retention and security measures to protect such personal information. We do not allow them to use this information for their own purposes.
5. International Transfers of Your Personal Information
Laerdal has operations around the world and our services providers operate in countries across the world. To facilitate global operations, your personal information may be transferred, disclosed, stored or processed in countries other than your own. Those countries may have different privacy and data protection laws from the country where personal information was originally provided. One way in which this may occur is where your personal information is stored in a controlled access repository in the cloud. “In the cloud” refers to servers in a data center that are managed by a third party and accessible through the Internet, and that data center may be in a country other than your own. Whenever we transfer your personal information to other countries, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and that any transfers to countries other than the country of your location are carried out in compliance with applicable legal requirements.
In case that your personal information is transferred outside the European Economic Area we will rely on the European Commission’s 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses, or other applicable data transfer mechanisms. We may also transfer your personal information to countries that have been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection (the list of the adequate countries can be found
here.
We also have equivalent provisions in relation to data being transferred from the United Kingdom (such as the International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses) and Switzerland as required by the laws applicable in those jurisdictions. For personal information transfers between our group of companies, we have implemented an intra-group agreement based on the European Commission’s 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses (with any modifications required by local laws). These also include implementation of appropriate data processing agreements and safeguards with third parties, where relevant. If you would like to obtain a copy of the safeguards, we use to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, please contact us at
privacy@laerdal.com
6. Retention of Your Personal Information
In the limited circumstances where we are the controller of your personal information (see
"How We Use Personal Information"
above for further details), we keep your personal information only for as long as is it is necessary to fulfill the processing purposes described in this statement. Once the purposes for your personal information processing are exhausted or retention period has expired, whatever comes first, we will either delete your personal information by relying on a technical method that makes recovery or retrieval of such information impossible or render data no longer personally indefinable by removing certain data categories that identify you.
To ensure that personal information is only processed for a limited period of time, we have established data retention policies and schedules that specify applicable retention periods for each purpose of personal information processing. Namely, we will delete personal information after the processing purpose is exhausted unless the personal information is required for compliance with legal obligations or establishment of legal claims. By way of example, once your organisation ceases to use our Services, we will delete account information and other personal information necessary to use the Services (in respect of which we are the controller), unless the data is required for compliance with legal obligations or establishment of legal claims.
In case we rely on consent for processing your personal information, we will stop processing when the consent is withdrawn, or the processing purpose is exhausted, whatever comes first. Please note that withdrawing consent will not affect lawfulness of the processing based on consent before withdrawal. Where you have withdrawn your consent, in some cases personal information cannot be deleted, due to the technical reasons, from our systems and backups. Where this is the case, we will ensure that appropriate measures that prevent further use of such personal information are in place. Please note that in some circumstances we store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements (e.g. tax laws, accounting laws, etc.). In specific circumstances we also store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.
Where your employer or another organization is the controller of your personal information, please refer to their personal information protection policies and processes for information about the relevant retention period(s).
7. Personal Information Integrity and Security
We are committed to ensuring a high level of privacy, data protection and security of the personal information in our control or possession. Security of your personal information is our priority and we maintain reasonable technical, contractual, organizational and physical measures to safeguard your personal information. We are certified under the ISO 27001 standard for our Information Security Management System and our information security practices are audited annually by internal and external auditors. The ISO 27001 certification requires us to have appropriate physical, electronic and managerial protection measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, erasure, loss, use, processing or disclosure of your personal information. We have implemented frameworks for continuous improvement of security, privacy and data protection, and we will continue to review and update our security measures where appropriate, as new technology becomes available.
8. Your Rights
If the data processing we undertake is subject to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or equivalent laws, and taking into account certain exemptions, (in some cases this is dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking), you have the following rights in relation to your personal information:

Not to be subject to automated decision-making - You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal or similar effects on you.
To lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority or regulator – You have the right to file a complaint to the relevant authorities in case that you are not satisfied with our privacy practices.
We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing any personal information requested by you.
