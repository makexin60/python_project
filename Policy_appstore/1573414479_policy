The new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) came into force on May 25th 2018. Whilst the new GDPR focuses on ensuring people have more control over their own data and also makes everything more transparent with a clearer environment in which to operate. The introduction of GDPR strengthens data protection legislation through tough measures which the EU trust in what is an established digital economy.
Our clients are now asking us to ensure we are GDPR compliant which is to be expected. We have invested a lot of time in ensuring we are compliant with GDPR with a rigorous programme of activity to audit our data, review the key scope and rules before implementing various processes and policies that enable us to continue working with our clients. All our documents and processes have been carefully reviewed both internally but also by an external law firm. We are proud to say that we are now operating to GDPR compliant standards.

For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature.

Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to them (using both physical and electronic means). Our staff receive data protection training, and we have a set of detailed data protection policies and procedures which personnel are required to follow when handling personal data.
We store personal data in computer storage facilities, paper-based files and other records. We take steps to protect the personal data against loss, unauthorised access, use modification or disclosure, and against other misuse. These steps include password protection and access privileges for accessing our IT system, encryption of data stored and physical access restrictions to paper files. Some of these services, such as hosting our computer file servers, are provided by third parties in the UK and we endeavour to ensure that they also have adequate privacy safeguards in place through the use of contractual measures to protect personal data.

The information we hold is never used for marketing purposes and is never marketed, rented or sold to any third parties.
International transfers
Many of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
Data security
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions carried out by us or our chosen third-party provider of payment processing services will be encrypted using Secured Sockets Layer technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of Our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
We will collect and store personal data on your Device using application data caches and browser web storage (including HTML5) and other technology.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
In some circumstances, the Controller can ask us to delete data: see Your legal rights below for further information.
We do not retain any biometric face data.
Face data is processed by InfoTrack Limited for the provision of their Verification of Identity (“VOI”) checks and this shall be stored and retained in accordance with the eCOS® Privacy Policy which is signposted within the App.
In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
You have the right to:
‍
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
‍
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
‍
Request erasure
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
‍
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
‍
Request restriction of processing
of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(a)       if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
(b)       where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(c)       where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(d)       you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
‍
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
You also have the right to ask us not to continue to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can exercise any of these rights at any time by writing to us at Perfect Portal Ltd, 137 Fylde Road, Southport, PR9 9XP or emailing us at
DPO@perfectportal.co.uk
