Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store your personal data when you use Garmin navigation mobile apps, including the Garmin Drive app, Vault and live view services, Smartphone Link app, Garmin Motorize app, Tread app, dēzl app, Garmin Catalyst app, NAVIGON select Telekom Edition apps, and other websites or apps that link to this policy. NAVIGON is a Garmin brand but is
no longer supported
.
What personal data does Garmin collect?
When you use Garmin mobile navigation apps, we ask for personal data — such as your contact information, location, device information, and email address — so you can receive personalized support, get important information about your devices, and get the most out of our products.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.
When You Use Live Location-based or Voice-based Services
We collect your device information and location to provide quality live services. Can you imagine getting an accurate weather forecast or up-to-date traffic data without a location? That would be tough!
We collect the information above plus your request and other relevant information we may need in order to give you the proper response to your voice command or request.
We also process your app store account email address to be sure that we’re providing the services you’ve subscribed to or purchased.
When You Use select Telekom Edition Apps
We collect device information when you use or make purchases within select Telekom Edition apps to make sure you are a subscriber to the service and to help complete your orders.
When You Store or Access Dash Cam Video Online
When you use features such as Vault or live view, we collect or stream video, audio, location, speed and other relevant data. That way, you can view, edit and share recorded footage, or watch your live footage. We only store footage that you manually save or that is saved automatically via incident detection.

Your personal data belongs to you, and you control what you share and with whom you share it.

Dive Activity Data
Any time you upload a dive, you get to determine how private or public it is. If you want others in the Garmin Dive community to see a dive and cheer you on, just set that dive to public when you upload it.
LIVETRACK
You can share a link to your device’s real-time location with your friends and family so they can follow along as you run.

Privacy Policy for Consumer Automotive Applications
Last Updated: September 7, 2023
Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we process your personal data when you use our Consumer Automotive websites, apps, products, and services, including the Garmin Drive™ app, Vault and live view services, Smartphone Link app, Garmin Motorize™ app, Tread® app, dēzl™ app, Garmin Catalyst™ app, NAVIGON select Telekom Edition apps, and other websites or apps that link to this policy.
NAVIGON, a Garmin brand,
has been discontinued
as of Dec. 1, 2020.
Other Garmin websites, services, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy. For example, if you enable features that upload location-based activity data, such as location, timestamp, elevation, speed, distance, course, tracks, routes, waypoints, and vehicle profile, our use of such data is subject to the privacy policy for
Garmin Outdoor and Recreation
.

The legal grounds for processing personal data specified in this Privacy Policy are based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and laws in other jurisdictions that have similar grounds.

Categories of Personal Data Processed by Garmin
When you create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
In some apps, you may have the ability to add additional information to your profile, such as your vehicle information and photo.
When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
When you use our live location-based services — such as weather, local search, safety cameras, traffic, fuel prices, parking, real-time tracking (e.g., LiveTrack, group ride, or group ride mobile),
Foursquare
,
Flinc
,
Glympse
, and multimodal routing, within our apps, we collect personal data, such as your device identifier, app store account information, and location. We also may create transactional logs that are useful in diagnosing service issues.
When you use NAVIGON select Telekom Edition apps or make an in-app purchase through a NAVIGON select Telekom Edition app, we collect personal data, such as your device identifier.
When you use voice-based search, we collect personal data, such as your device identifier, location, voice-based search requests, and the names of contacts and stored places of interest (POIs) to provide you with location-relevant search results.
If you use a Garmin auto navigation device or app and provide your consent, then we will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording. If you provide your consent when asked, then we may also share this aggregated data with third parties to enhance the quality of the traffic, parking, and other features enabled by content providers.
If you choose to upload or access video through certain features such as Vault or live view, we collect or stream video, audio, and related metadata, such as location, speed, and date and time of recording. Even when you enable video storage, we only upload footage that you manually save or that is saved automatically via incident detection. We will store this data for no longer than the duration specified in your subscription. We do not store any footage viewed during the live view.
You can choose to upload your location-based activity data from your device to your account. Activity data may include data such as location, timestamp, elevation, speed, distance, course, and vehicle profile. You can use your device without uploading your location-based data to Garmin.
You can choose to upload photos and other content (e.g., comments, ratings) to participate in community features available in our apps (such as the Great Ride community in the Tread app).
If a Garmin user adds you as an emergency contact to their account, they provide us with your phone number or email address.
We take steps to identify, detect, and mitigate fraud and abuse on our services, websites, and apps. If we suspect a fraudulent request or claim has been made relating to your account or device, we may process data relating to the device(s) associated with your account, basic account information such as email address, name, phone number(s), and mailing address(es), or our communication history with you in order to adequately investigate the request or claim. We may process content that you have contributed to your account, such as activities, photos, comments, and reviews, to develop and test measures to help identify, detect, and mitigate disruption and damage to our services, websites, and apps potentially caused by or related to such content, to enforce our terms of use, to identify and remove inappropriate, harmful, or abusive content, and for related purposes.
Categories of Recipients of Personal Data

You should use caution in determining with whom you want to share the video and be sure that you trust them to not send the link and passcode to others whom you do not want to be able to view the video.
If you provide emergency contacts to us to be used in the event that an incident is detected or reported and you are involved in such an incident , we will send a notification with information about the incident, such as location, to your chosen emergency contacts via SMS or email.
If you use the Garmin Catalyst™ app, you can connect with other Garmin Catalyst™ users to share your racing session data. In addition, your name, profile picture, vehicle information (e.g., make, model, year), and racing session data may appear on leaderboards.
