1. General information
Many businesses (referred to below as “business partners”) need to be able to identify their contractual partners (“users”). For example, Germany’s Money Laundering Act (
Geldwäschegesetz
– GwG) requires that businesses in certain sectors (such as providers of financial services or special insurance products, or casinos or other organizers/operators of games of chance) verify the identities of their customers/users. In addition to the requirements of the GwG, there are other situations involving an obligation to verify identity, including an identity check following the purchase of a prepaid SIM card as stipulated by the German Telecommunications Act (
Telekommunikationsgesetz
– TKG) and proof of age for the use of adults-only services or online gaming.
In addition to identity checks, some companies also need to verify specific personal authorizations. For example, identifying the user (signer) is an important prerequisite for the creation of a qualified electronical signature (digital signature).
Protection of the privacy of the person to be identified (referred to below as “user”) during the processing of personal data is of great importance to
Deutsche
Post AG and is provided for in all POSTIDENT processes.
POSTIDENT
designates the processes used to gather identity data or the complete process of establishing the identity of individuals (e.g., in a post office or video chat) for business partners.
Identification data
is data (such as data from an ID card) gathered for and provided to a business partner for a specific purpose as part of a POSTIDENT process.
Verification data
is information and recordings (e.g., scans of ID documents) that must be recorded and processed due to legal requirements or legitimate interests in order to prove that identification measures were carried out.
2. Purpose, use and legal basis
All data collected or otherwise obtained in POSTIDENT processes are used by
Deutsche
Post AG for the purpose of checking the identity of individuals on behalf of its business partners. Please contact the responsible business partner for further questions regarding the processing of your personal data. An exception is POSTIDENT E-Signing; see the POSTIDENT E-Signing (digital signature) section. Any other use is only permitted with the user’s consent. The only two exceptions are:
POSTIDENT E-Signing process. See the POSTIDENT E-Signing (digital signature) section. Any other use is only permitted with the user's consent.
Data collected for quality assurance purposes in the AutoID process. See the description of quality assurance in the
AutoID process
3. Type and scope
The scope of data processing and use by
Deutsche
Post AG in connection with identification processes depends on the reasons for such processes, i.e., the intended or existing contractual relationship between you as the user and the business partner concerned, and the legal requirements calling for proof of identification, e.g., in accordance with the
Geldwäschegesetz
(Germany’s money laundering act), the
Telekommunikationsgesetz
(Germany’s telecommunications act), etc.
At most,
Deutsche
Post AG will (depending on the situation) collect the following user data when identifying a person with POSTIDENT.
1. ID card data
Form of address
Title/academic degree
Last name
First name (all first names)
Name at birth
Place of birth
Date of birth
Nationality
Street and house number
Zip code and town/city
ID information such as type of ID, ID number, place of issue, date of issue, issuing authority, expiration date
Mobile telephone
Email address
During the identification process, you may receive an e-mail with a case number that can be used at any time to start the identification process. The user’s e-mail address is needed for this purpose. For some identification methods, a mobile telephone number will be needed to receive a TAN as an additional secure factor for two-factor authentication.
2. Verification data
If the business partner requests identification compliant with certain legal requirements (e.g.,
Geldwäschegesetz
(GwG - German money laundering act),
Telekommunikationsgesetz
(TKG German telecommunications act), eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) Regulation and the like), this includes transmission of the ID information and, depending on the identification method, the verification data. Depending on the method, this can include:
Photo or screenshot of user
Photo or scan of ID document
Photo or scan of driver’s license
Recording (audio and video) of entire identification process
Place and date of identification
Photo or Scan of signature
4. Transfer of data
If the identity check takes place with the specific intention of reaching an agreement with a business partner, the data required for the relevant proof of identity will be transferred to the intended business partner after completion of the identification process.
Service companies and service providers are involved during the identity check and for customer service and IT services.
5. Description of the methods
The rules described below apply for the individual identity check process.
POSTIDENT by post office
Main steps in the identity check
Identity check begins when user presents POSTIDENT coupon.
User’s ID checked with ID reader by post office employee; ID data copied automatically.
Post office employee checks the data and verifies that the photograph on the ID document matches the user.
User verifies data and provides sample signature.
Transfer of data to business partner
Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
Due to legal requirements, your ID document will also be scanned during the identification process at the post office of your choice.
The ID data and the digital copy of the ID document are recorded for transfer to the business partner and for verifying the data. The digital copy of the ID document is only transferred to business partners that are subject to corresponding regulatory requirements such as the
Geldwäschegesetz
(GwG - German money laundering act), the
Telekommunikationsgesetz
(TKG - German telecommunications act) or the eIDAS Regulation.
POSTIDENT by video chat
Main steps in the identification process
Step 1: Identification process begins on business partner website
Transfer from business partner website to identity check on POSTIDENT portal.
Step 2: Selection of POSTIDENT by video chat as method
As needed, entry of personal information and selection of the ID document to be used in the identification process.
Step 3: Video chat
Using the camera in the user’s device, a service employee leads the user through the video identification process, verifies the ID data and takes photos.
Step 4: Provision of identification data
By entering a TAN received via text message, the user confirms and concludes the identification process.
Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
The recordings are checked in the background using software and machine learning methods. This process uses various security features to verify that the ID documents are genuine, and checks that the photograph on the document matches the video sequence recorded by you.
Due to official requirements, the following are also produced during POSTIDENT by video chat:
Photograph or screenshot of user (portrait)
Photograph or screenshot of ID document
Complete audio-visual recording of the process
These recorded data and the identification data can be used by
Deutsche
Post AG for the purpose of monitoring the process, in particular for quality assurance measures taken to ensure compliance with the legal requirements that apply to the process. At the latest, the data will be deleted after expiration of the periods listed in section 7.
Possible processing of biometric data
Over and above this, the processing of biometric data is possible during the POSTIDENT by video chat procedure in order to better detect fraud attempts such as identity theft. During this procedure the postion data of your face will be compared against your ID document.
Your biometric data will not be stored. Only the results of the processing activity are stored; these contain no biometric data and do not allow any inference as to the identity of the person verified. Furthermore
no
further processing, e.g. for analysis or profiling purposes, takes place.
Should you wish to avoid the processing of biometric data, you may opt to make use of an alternative procedure such as POSTIDENT by post office or POSTIDENT by eID, if this is offered by your business partner. If no such alternative is currently available, please contact your business partner.
POSTIDENT by eID
Main steps in the identification process
Transfer of user from business partner website to identity check on POSTIDENT portal
In the portal, the user can choose to use the POSTIDENT by eID via desktop or smartphone
In the case of identification via desktop, the user will be automatically routed to the
Ausweis
App website with the software from the German government’s service provider (
Governikus
) and the
Ausweis
App will start
In the case of identification via smartphone, the identification process runs via the Postident app
By entering the six-digit PIN from their ID, the user agrees to the encrypted transfer of the previously displayed information
Depending on the business partner, photos of the identification document may also be taken
Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
The ID data and photos of the identification document (depending on the business partner) are only recorded for transfer to the business partner and random quality control by
Deutsche
Post AG.
POSTIDENT by AutoID
Create recordings of identity documents as well as a short video sequence of the document and the face. Subsequently, the data is transmitted to the POSTIDENT portal for verification.
Step 1: Capture ID information
Show the front and back of the ID card
The app automatically recognizes the document and reads out the necessary personal data
Step 2: Checking the security features
Vertical and horizontal tilting of the ID document
Checking the security features (including holographic features)
Step 3: ID card comparison
Recording a short video portrait (“selfie video”)
Recording of face and movements
Face image matching and tampering check
Completion: delivery of results
Automatic testing using machine learning techniques
If necessary, quality control by service agents
Automatic transmission of the results of the identification to you
Successful data transmission
After successful transmission of the data to the POSTIDENT portal, the user can be forwarded to a business partners website.
Document review and data provision
The recordings are checked in the background using software and machine learning methods. This process uses various security features to verify that the ID document is genuine, and checks that the photograph on the document matches the video sequence recorded by you. If all checks have been successfully validated, the identification result is automatically forwarded to the business partner.
In the event of abnormalities and to check the correct functioning of the software, qualified service employees can be used to check individual identification processes. For this purpose, all decision-relevant steps are checked for completeness and correctness by the trained service employee. The identification data is automatically transmitted to the business partner after the verification is completed.
The business partner may initiate an automated decision in the subsequent processes.
In accordance with Article 22 (3) GDPR, you have the right to intervene by a person on the part of the controller, to express your own point of view and to contest the decision when using automated decision-making. These rights are to be asserted against the partner, who can, for example, offer you alternative identification procedures.
Explanations of data collected and transmitted
The ID data and verification data (including the digital copy of the ID document) are collected for transfer to the business partner and for validation of the data. The verification data (e.g. the digital copy of the ID document) is only transferred to business partners that are subject to corresponding regulatory requirements (such as the eIDAS regulation). The ID data and verification data may also by processed by
Deutsche
Post AG for quality assurance purposes. See also:
Quality assurance in AutoID
.
Processing of biometric data
As part of AutoID's implementation of the POSTIDENT procedure, biometric data is processed in order to better detect fraud attempts such as identity theft. For example, the position data of the face is compared to the ID document.
Your biometric data will not be stored. Only the results of the processing are stored that do not themselves represent biometric data and do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the person to be identified. In addition, there is no further processing, e.g. for analyses or profiling.
If you would like to avoid the processing of biometric data, you can alternatively use other methods - if offered by your business partner - such as POSTIDENT via post office or POSTIDENT via online ID function. If these are not offered by your business partner, please contact them.
Quality assurance in the AutoID process
The competent controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is
Deutsche
Post AG
.
It may be necessary to collect and use ID data and verification data for the continuous improvement of identification through automated decision-making in the
AutoID process
. In this case the data is used for the purpose of fraud prevention, for example, and to verify that the machine learning methods and associated software are correct and continuously optimized.
Your data will of course only be kept for as long as it is needed to perform these tasks, after which it will be securely deleted.
See retention periods
.
Here, too, the backup of strictly confidential data meets the highest standards at all times, and is monitored continuously by our IT security measures.
If, after the identification process, you wish to withdraw your consent to the use of your data for quality assurance purposes in AutoID, please address your withdrawal request to: AutoID.Postident@
deutsche
post.de
The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Identification data is used for quality assurance purposes in order to allow for continuous quality improvement and to avoid decision-making errors in automated processing. The interests of the data subjects are safeguarded through very limited access rights, a storage period of no more than 180 days and a right to object.
POSTIDENT E-Signing (digital signature, with previous identification)
Essential steps of the digital signature
Step 1: Identification
Transfer of the user with the documents to be signed to the signing portal. Identification of the user (signer) by online ID function (eID) in the Postident App or by video chat.
Step 2: Review documents online
Display of the documents to be signed for review (via Web or App) by the user after successful identification.
Step 3: Digital signature

Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
The collected data regarding the user are used solely for providing identification, certificate generation and signature services; it is subsequently archived. In accordance with the stipulations of the eIDAS Regulation, the data are kept at DPAG until the cessation of the trust service’s activity. Should DPAG cease the activity, the data will then be transferred to the
Bundesnetzagentur
(German supervisory authority responsible for eIDAS) for providing evidence in legal proceedings and for ensuring continuity of the service; (see eIDAS article 24 (2) h). The user data compiled and kept for this identification method are described in the POSTIDENT by video chat section.
POSTIDENT E-Signing with identity transfer (digital signature, without additional identification)
The POSTIDENT E-Signing service with identity transfer creates the opportunity for the business partner (e.g., a bank) to transfer existing identity data to
Deutsche
Post with the consent of the private customer as part of a digital signature. An additional identification using POSTIDENT by video chat to legitimize the digital signature can therefore be omitted.
Essential steps of the digital signature with identity transfer
Step 1: Start on the business partner's website
Start of the digital contract signature process on the business partner's website.
Step 2: Transfer of identity data
Passing on of the necessary identity data from the business partner to
Deutsche
Post with the consent of the user.
Step 3: Digital signature
Digital display of the documents to be signed for verification by the user after successful verification of the mobile phone number.
Step 4: Conclusion of contract
Approval for the legally valid application of the digital signature by entering an SMS TAN (conclusion of contract) as well as the option to download the signed documents.
Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
The personal identity data is used exclusively for the purpose of providing the certificate creation and signature service for a digital contract signing by
Deutsche
Post AG and is then archived. The corresponding data is kept by the trust service (
Deutsche
Post AG) in accordance with the eIDAS specifications.
The following identity and process data are transferred from business partners to
Deutsche
Post AG:
First name(s)
Surname

Deutsche
Post
Step 4: Digital transmission of result data (identification result, place and date of hand over) to the business partner
Notes regarding recorded and transferred data
Recipients ID data will only be used for identity check purpose. Transfer of data to the business partner is limited to the identification result and based on the result either reason of decline or place and date of hand over. The data will be deleted latest after expiration of the periods listed in section 7.
6. Interruption and resumption
Cancelation of the POSTIDENT process and withdrawal
The user can cancel the identification or signature process at any time and withdraw consent for data recording and transfer. To the extent that no identification data have been transferred to the relevant business partner until that time, the recorded data will be deleted (subject to statutory retention periods or other legal requirements).
Cancelation of POSTIDENT delivery process

In order to comply with legal requirements (e.g., Section 99 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO), Section 65 of the German Postal Act (PostG), Section 257 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), Section 147 of the German Fiscal Code (AO, GoBD)) and to ensure that the contract can be processed and fulfilled in accordance with Article 6 (1)(b) of the GDPR, the buyer’s personal data is processed and retained for the applicable statutory periods. In particular:
Method of receipt
Type and number of the product
Email address of the buyer
Payment type
Recent purchases (purchase date, order number, Portocode of the mobile stamp and/or access to the PDF file with the purchased online stamp, email address in case of cancellation)
When you buy a stamp via the Online Franking Post service, various payment methods are available.
One payment method is the online payment service PayPal. The European operator of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.á.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A. 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. If you select PayPal as your payment method, the data required for the payment process will be transmitted to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, you consent to the transmission of your personal data necessary for processing your payment.
Alternatively, a credit card can be used for paying for stamps issued by the Online Franking Post service. We use the Braintree payment service offered by PayPal (Europe) S.á.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A. 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxemburg, for this purpose. The data required to process the transaction (credit card number, expiry data and security code) will be collected and processed by the payment service provider.
We also offer the option of processing payments using Apple Pay. The data required to process the transaction will be collected and processed by the payment service provider. To carry out the payment transaction, personal data such as name, address, company name, email address, landline and mobile number and IP address is regularly transmitted to Apple Pay. The payment provider’s respective data privacy provisions apply. You can find a link in the section below.
These companies to which we transmit personal data are independent controllers, which means that we are not the ones who determine how the data that we transmit is processed. When your data is forwarded to independent controllers, their data privacy provisions apply. We recommend that you read their privacy policies and familiarize yourself with your data privacy rights before interacting with them.
With the exception of the name of the payment service provider used and anonymized IDs (which are necessary in order to process withdrawal or cancellation requests),
Deutsche Post
AG does not store any details on the payment. The entire payment process and the use of the payment data required for this purpose is handled solely by the payment service provider.
PayPal’s data protection provisions can be inspected in the
PayPal data privacy policy
. The data privacy policy for the use of the Braintree service can be found at
https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal
.
You can find the data privacy provisions of Apple Pay at:
Apple Pay data privacy provisions
.
We would like to point out the possibility of transmission to a third country as part of data transmission to these payment service providers. This means that, in order to provde the listed payment services, we may have to transmit certain data to these payment providers located in countries without an appropriate level of data privacy (e.g. to the United States). You acknowledge that these entities may be subject to laws and regulations in their respective jurisdictions that could obligate them to forward data to the relevant authorities in the respective country. By using the payment services, you consent to us transmitting such data for the purpose of providing the services.
To make it easier for you to use your stamps, purchase-specific data such as your order number, date of purchase, email address and the type of postage purchased is stored locally on your mobile device for 30 days or until you uninstall the
Post
& DHL app, and can be found in the “Recent Purchases” section of the app. The legal basis for this is Art 6 para. 1, lit. b of GDPR. Your email address is necessary for order processing so that we can confirm your purchase. The legal basis for the processing is Article 6 (1)c of the GDPR in conjunction with section 368 of the BGB (“
Quittung
”). Additionally, your email address is stored in the app to enable you to cancel if you so choose. Email addresses are only stored locally and are therefore only saved within the application on your mobile device. The legal basis in this regard is Article 6 (1)b of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
For an easier and more pleasant purchasing process, you can also choose to save your email address so it will already be filled in when you next want to make a purchase. Email address are only stored locally, and so are only saved within the application on your mobile device. The legal basis for this is Article 6, para. 1, sentence 1, lit. a of GDPR, i.e. your consent.
We will disclose data to government bodies only if required by law to do so.
We use tracking software (Adobe Analytics) on our website to monitor their frequency of use and the number of users. This software does not collect personal data or IP addresses. The data is used exclusively in anonymized, summarized form for statistical purposes and for the development of the website.

Cookies help us to determine how frequently our Internet pages are accessed as well as the number of users. And they help us configure our offers so that they are as convenient and efficient as possible for you.
On the one hand, we use "session cookies", i.e. cookies that are stored exclusively for the duration of your visit to one of our Internet pages. On the other, we use "permanent cookies” to retain information about visitors who repeatedly access one of our Internet pages. The purpose of using cookies is to be able to offer you optimal user guidance as well as to "recognize" you and thus be able to present (as far as possible) diversified Internet pages and fresh content during repeated use. The content of a permanent cookie is limited to an identification number. Name, IP address, etc. are not saved. We do not create an individual profile of your online activities.
Using our products and services without cookies is also possible.

Item tracking
Item tracking allows you to track a shipment addressed to or sent by you and see when it is likely to be delivered. In order to track an item, simply enter your shipment number to see the current status of your consignment. You also receive all the important detailed information on your shipment. In addition, a sender or recipient can obtain further information on the respective shipment by e-mail or text message. To this end, the e-mail address or mobile phone number of the message recipient can be entered and the notification function activated. In this case, the person entering the data must make sure that the message recipient agrees to their e-mail address, mobile phone number and notification being processed.
The following data are processed in the context of item tracking, for example: shipment number, sender’s name and address, recipient’s name and address, sender’s/recipient’s e-mail address if selected, name and address of substitute recipient if selected, sender’s customer data, product or service designation, item transport history, recipient’s signature, confirmation of minimum age check (over 16/over 18).
Data are processed for the performance of a contract on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
In selected cases, DHL shipment tracking offers you a live tracking option for your item. Live tracking enables you to track the route of your parcel on a live map on the day of delivery. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, as this processing takes place for performance of a contract.
Tracking of domestic express shipments transported by DHL Express Germany
GmbH
is also possible on this page using item tracking. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, as this processing takes place for performance of a contract.
By integrating Google Maps for delivery to a
Pack
station or postal retail outlet, DHL
Paket GmbH
has improved the user experience on this website.
Item tracking: for some shipments we offer the live tracking function, which allows you to track the route of your item live on a Google Maps map.
Delivery to
Pack
station/retail outlet: the item tracking function notifies you when the option exists to reroute your shipment to a
Pack
station or retail outlet if you will not be home at the designated delivery time. You can select your preferred
Pack
station or retail outlet on a Google Maps map.
We use Google Maps from Google Inc. (Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) to display the maps. The following data are transferred to Google:
Referrer (address of the page on which Google Maps is being used)
IP address of the user
Google account (if the user is registered with Google, the account will be recognized and correctly assigned)
Browser; browser preferences, size and resolution; browser plugins; date; language setting
User’s location – only if the user explicitly confirms the browser prompt “
Soll www.dhl.de auf Ihren Standort zugreifen dürfe
n?” (“Allow www.dhl.de to access your location?”)
The data are processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. DHL
Paket GmbH
has a legitimate interest in displaying the DHL locations as accurately as possible for its customers, as one in ten website visitors submit a search request while on the website. In the context of a location search, the map also shows customers the route from their current location to the retail outlet/Packstation. This service would not be possible without displaying a map.
During the location search, only the search address entered by the user is forwarded. We will not link the search to the user, nor will it be saved.

The data is processed primarily for purposes of contract fulfillment pursuant to Article 6(1) letter (b) GDPR. The legal basis for the processing of the (substitute) recipient data in principle is Article 6(1) letter (e) GDPR. The provisions of Section 68 of the Postal Services Act (PostG) allow the processing of personal data to ensure a functioning postal system and are thus in the special public interest as defined in Article 6(1) letter (e) GDPR. This also includes the authorisation under Section 68 para. 3 clause 1 PostG to process the personal data of recipients or substitute recipients insofar as this is necessary for the proper delivery of postal items.
To increase security in online retailing for our customers and safeguard our own legitimate interests, the Deutsche Post Webshop uses AI-powered tools to recognize and prevent fraud in a timely fashion. We compare the data in any order or request with the customer's purchasing history (if there is one) to check for discrepancies that may be suspect. In cases of suspicion, specific payment methods may not be available or your order/request will be checked again manually by our staff. This may lead to a slight delay in order processing in some cases. Data are not forwarded to third parties during this review.
In addition, pursuant to Article 6(1) letter (c) GDPR, data is also processed to comply with statutory requirements such as Section 99 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO), Section 65 of the Federal Postal Services Act (PostG), etc.
Finally, data is also processed for the purposes listed below:
to secure payment,
for our security needs (e.g. to detect criminal offenses),
to produce statistics,
for quality assurance, process optimization and reliable planning and
to provide user-related advertising insofar as this is permitted.
The above constitute legitimate interests of
Deutsche Post AG
so that it can ensure smooth processes and can continually improve its products and services.
Deutsche Post AG
is of the opinion that there are no overriding interests to prevent processing because the intensity of interference with rights by such processing is kept to a minimum, e.g. by using pseudonyms. Article 6(1) letter (f) GDPR thus provides the legal basis for the data processing.
If you wish to utilize your right of objection, especially to the use of your data for promotional purposes, please contact:
Customer service – Letter
As a general rule, shipment data is deleted following contract fulfillment; however, certain aspects should be taken into account. Data from shipments for which no proof of delivery is required is stored for a maximum of 15 working days for the purpose of quality assurance and revenue protection, and for the fulfillment of any additional services ordered. For shipments requiring proof of delivery, shipment data is stored for a period of liability of up to four years (cf. Section 439 (1) HGB) and in accordance with statutory retention period obligations of up to ten years (e.g. Section 257 HGB or Section 147 AO). In the case of basic letter tracking, data is stored for 21 days.
DHL
Paket GmbH
does not disseminate your personal data to third parties and will not do so in future unless this is stipulated by law, required for the purpose of the contract or you have given express consent for us to do so. Data is disclosed to the companies involved in the provision of postal services (e.g. PayPal following the successful purchase of a label via the online franking service. Similarly, data is transmitted to comply with statutory requirements (e.g. to investigating authorities).
Some customer services and IT services are outsourced to external providers. External service providers who process data on our behalf provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that processing will meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation. These providers are contractually bound within the meaning of Art. 28 of the GDPR to maintain strict confidentiality. In these cases, DHL
Paket GmbH
remains responsible for protecting your personal data.  The external service providers process your personal data solely on documented instructions.
As a matter of principle, your data is not processed in third countries. However, where items are shipped abroad, the data is transmitted to the postal service in that country in order to perform the contract.
Redirection and storage services
Your personal data (first and last name, e-mail address where applicable, telephone number where applicable, first and last names of other persons to whom the redirection service should apply where applicable, your (former) address (street name, house number, postal code, city, any additional address information and/or P.O. box), new address (state, street name, house number, postal code, city, any additional address information and/or P.O. box) for redirection, reason for redirection, dates and duration of the redirection service, any additional services) shall be primarily processed for the purpose of mail redirection and therefore performance of a contract pursuant to Article 6 (1b) GDPR in conjunction with Section 68 (1) sentence 3 of the Federal Postal Services Act (
Postgesetz
,
PostG
).
In individual cases, the new address shall also be transmitted pursuant to Article 6 (1c) GDPR, in order to comply with statutory requirements such as Section 99 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure (
Strafprozeßordnung
, StPO), Section 65
PostG
, etc. If you consent to the address data being shared with senders who were aware of your former address by selecting the relocation notification service, the data shall be processed on the basis of a declaration of consent pursuant to Article 6 (1a) GDPR.
Your personal data shall also be processed for the purpose of producing statistics, for quality assurance, process optimization and reliable planning, and to provide you with user-related advertising insofar as this is permitted.
Deutsche Post AG
has a legitimate interest in this in order to ensure a smooth process and to improve products and services on an ongoing basis. Deutsche Post AG believes that data subjects’ privacy interests do not override its own interests because, in terms of the potential magnitude of interference with privacy rights, the data processing is kept to a minimum, e.g. by using pseudonyms. Article 6 (1f) GDPR thus provides the legal basis for the data processing.
Personal data shall be stored for a maximum of two years following submission of the application and then deleted.
Your data shall be transmitted to the companies involved in the provision of postal services. Deutsche Post has outsourced certain customer services and services relating to IT to service providers that are involved in processing orders. We can make the relocation address stated in your redirection application available on request to senders who hold your former address for the purpose of updating your address details. However, we will only do this if:
the requestor knows your former address
and you have signed the declaration of consent in the redirection application
and the redirection application has been made due to a permanent change of address and not due to temporary absence, for example.
If the declaration of consent has not been signed, we will only share the relocation address if we are obligated to provide this information by law:
in the event of requests from courts and authorities that require the new address for the purposes of issuing mail (Section 65 PostG),
in the event of requests from consumer protection associations and similar institutions for the purpose of the legal prosecution of breaches of consumer protection and competition law (Section 13 Injunctive Relief Act (Unterlassungsklagengesetz), Section 13 Act against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb)),
in the event of requests from other postal service providers for their own redirections, provided you have not declined to provide the information to this group of recipients (Section 54 PostG).
If you have signed the declaration of consent and have not objected to Deutsche Post providing your change of address details to other postal service providers, other postal service providers may share the change of address details with the sender of a mail item you have ordered on request for the purpose of ensuring the correct addressing of future mail items. This will therefore ensure that as many future mail items as possible bear the new address immediately. If you do not consent to this particular condition, you may decline to have your relocation address shared with these parties.
Notes regarding the declaration of consent
By requesting a relocation notification, you consent to the storage and transmission of the address data to persons and companies that still hold your former address. We do this in order to meet our customers’ need and desire for all mail to be sent to the correct address. When changing address, people often forget to notify all of their previous communication partners of their new address. To ensure that their mail items continue to reach you, your address shall be transmitted by Deutsche Post itself and/or Deutsche Post Adress GmbH & Co. KG – as well as to other service providers involved in the postal industry where applicable – under the conditions stated above. However, this shall only happen for a maximum of 2 years. Recipients of the new address may use and, if applicable, further process and transmit it in accordance with prevailing data protection legislation. A relocation address outside of Germany shall also only be transmitted under the above conditions, and where the level of data protection in place in the country from which the request originates corresponds with that of the Federal Data Protection Act, i.e. that your address will not be used for any purposes other than those permitted in Germany.
Private customers may include multiple persons on their application for a redirection order with Deutsche Post (for companies, only one company or part of a company may be included per order). In the event that persons making a joint application would prefer to choose different options, this can be amended even after submitting the order. You can withdraw or submit your consent by telephone or online by providing the number on your application confirmation. Our customer service team is available via the following service number +49 (0)228 4333112 (Mon.-Fri. from 8.00 AM - 6.00 PM and Sat. from 8.00 AM - 2.00 PM, excluding national public holidays in Germany) or online at deutschepost.de/meinkundenservice (German only).
Notes on your rights to object
We shall transmit your address details to postal service providers other than Deutsche Post so that they may also redirect your mail items if you do not object to this (Right to Object 1).
To ensure that as many mail items bear your new address as possible going forward and with immediate effect, other postal service providers may also transmit your change of address to senders that have issued mail to your former address if you do not object to this (Right to Object 2, only relevant for redirections due to relocation). If you have not selected the address update service (relocation notification) as part of your order, you will not need to exercise Right to Object 2 as this is exercised automatically.
If you or members of your household would like to exercise a Right to Object, please have the number provided on your application confirmation to hand and contact our customer service team by telephone on +49 (0)228 4333112 (Mon.-Fri. from 8.00 AM - 6.00 PM and Sat. from 8.00 AM - 2.00 PM, excluding national public holidays in Germany) or online at deutschepost.de/meinkundenservice (German only). Please indicate whether each person would like to exercise Right to Object 1, Right to Object 2 or both Rights to Object.
As a matter of principle, your personal data is not processed in third countries. However, if mail is to be redirected to a foreign address, the data shall be passed on to the postal service in that country for the purpose of performance of the contract.

In addition, in accordance with Article 6(1) letter c GDPR, data is processed to comply with statutory requirements such as Section 161 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO), Section 65 of the Federal Postal Services Act (PostG), Section 13a of the German Injunctions Act (UKlaG ), etc.
If there is no statutory obligation to pass data on to public offices or third parties, data will only be passed on to third parties if consent has been given by the holder of the P.O. box. The legal basis is Article 6(1) letter a of the GDPR.
Finally, data are also processed for the following purposes:
To fulfill our security requirements (e.g., for crime detection purposes)
For the purpose of compiling statistics
For the purposes of quality assurance, process optimization and planning security
Deutsche Post AG
has a legitimate interest in this in order to ensure a smooth process and to improve products and services on an ongoing basis. In
Deutsche Post AG
’s view, no overriding legitimate interest exists as the intrusiveness of the processing is kept to a minimum, e.g., through pseudonymization. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1) letter f of the GDPR.
If you want to exercise your right to object, please contact us using the following form:
Customer service form
.
Customers will soon be able to order the additional service of letter notification P.O. box, that is, the forwarding of the letter notification to the customer’s e-mail address. The legal basis for data processing of the additional service is the commission; that is, the processing of this data is necessary in order to fulfill the contract (Article 6(1) letter b of the GDPR).
In addition to being displayed in the customer’s DP AG shop account, which is secured via login/PIN, the item images are sent via the internet on behalf of the customer as unencrypted e-mail and are displayed unencrypted.
Data are passed on to the companies involved in the provision of postal services. Data are also passed on to comply with statutory requirements (e.g. to investigating authorities and to third parties, e.g. on the basis of Section 13a of the German Injunctions Act (UKlaG). Further, data are passed on to third parties if consent has been given by the holder of the P.O. Box. Moreover, some customer services and services in the field of IT are outsourced to external providers.
Your data are not processed in a third country.
Crypto stamp booklets
When you order crypto stamps (booklets), your customer data is stored for the legally permissible period and then deleted. The legal basis for processing this data is Art. 6(1) lit. b of the GDPR, as its processing is necessary for the performance the contract.
The number of crypto stamp booklets that a customer may purchase is limited. To ensure this, the number of booklets purchased is cross-checked with the customer's first and last names and address. The legal basis for this processing is DPAG's legitimate interest under Article 6(1) lit. f of the GDPR in being able to offer the booklets for sale to the largest possible number of customers.
You can redeem crypto stamps you have purchased on the platform of Royal Joh. Enschede B.V. (
Palletweg
78, 2031 DC Haarlem, The Netherlands) with which DPAG collaborates for this purpose.
On the platform of Royal Joh. Enschede B.V., you can consent to the option of having the following data transmitted to DPAG using a secure transmission method: form of address, first name, last name, e-mail address and which NFT is being purchased. In addition, you can optionally consent to having the associated wallet address transmitted to DPAG using a secure transmission method. The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Article 6(1) lit. a of the GDPR. You can revoke the consent you granted to Royal Joh. Enschede B.V. at any time. The revocation of your consent will not affect the validity of any processing that was hitherto conducted. In this connection, the data protection statement that applies to said processing takes precedence.
DPAG uses optional data for advertising, quality assurance and production optimization purposes. This data is stored until you revoke your consent, but no longer than six (6) months at most, and then deleted.

In addition,
Deutsche Post AG
reserves the right to perform a credit check if it provides any goods or services on a credit basis. Accordingly,

believes that there is no overriding interest on the part of the customer as scope for lodging an objection is available. If you wish to make use of your rights of objection – particularly with respect to the use of your data for advertising purposes – please contact
Deutsche Post AG
using the following form:

Data is transmitted to the companies involved in the provision of postal services. Similarly, data is transmitted to comply with statutory requirements (e.g. to investigating authorities). Some customer services and IT services are outsourced to external providers.
Your data is not generally processed in a third country. However, where items are shipped abroad, the data is transmitted to the postal service in that country in order to perform the contract.
b) Processing customer concerns (e.g. customer service, claims management)
Customer’s name, address and other contact data
Recipient’s name and address, if different
Details of the matter including, where applicable, details of the shipped item etc.
Bank account details, where applicable
Depending on the type of claim, additional data, such as title, date of birth, name at birth, nationality, profession, marital status, motor vehicle holder, date of driving license, arrangements with respect to representation, details of family members, ID data, residential situation, the course of events leading to claim, extent of loss etc., may be requested to handle the claim.
The data are primarily processed for the purpose of handling the matter, in accordance with Article 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR.
In addition, in accordance with Article 6 (1) lit. c) GDPR, the data are also processed in order to comply with legal requirements such as Section 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO), Section 65 of the Postal Act (PostG), regulatory requirements, or tax provisions, etc.
If you are not a customer, we process your data within the framework of incident reports on the basis of your consent pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR. This enables us to inform you of the incident status. You may withdraw this consent at any time with effect for the future. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on the consent before its withdrawal.
Finally, the data are also used to prepare statistics. In the opinion of
Deutsche Post AG
, there is no overriding interest worthy of protection, since the intervention intensity of the processing operations is kept as low as possible, e.g. through the use of anonymisation or aggregation. The legal basis for this is thus Art. 6 (1) lit. 1 f) GDPR.
A matter can be referred to another Group company if this is necessary for processing it. Data may be transmitted to insurance companies in connection with the processing of claims. Similarly, data is transmitted to comply with statutory requirements (e.g. to investigating authorities). Some customer services and IT services are outsourced to external providers.
Service providers outside the European Economic Area (EEA) are involved in handling customer concerns. Personal data is only transmitted if the EU Commission has attested that the third country has an appropriate level of data protection or there are other appropriate safeguards ensuring data protection (such as binding data protection regulations within the company or EU standard contractual clauses).
c) Video monitoring at retail outlets
Image data
The legal basis for processing the data is Section 6 of the Industrial Compensation Society’s Accident Prevention Rules, which has the status of a statutory requirement (Art. 6 (1) c) of the GDPR).
In addition,
Deutsche Post AG
has a legitimate interest. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) f) of the GDPR as
Deutsche Post AG
seeks to protect its staff, its property as well as that of its customers and also postal confidentiality.
Data is only accessed if there is any suspicion of criminal activity. In this connection, image data may also be transmitted to the investigating authorities.
Your data is not processed in a third country.
d) Reporting phishing activities
Reporting person’s name and e-mail address
Message contents
The data are used solely as a means to process the matter. The legal basis is a consent according to Article 6 (1) a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is declared by voluntarily reporting the phishing activity.
The received messages are generally deleted after ten weeks. Data are stored longer only in the rare exceptional cases in which the matter could not yet be conclusively processed.
Service providers were used to process the notifications. In addition, data are forwarded to the registrar and the host of the website concerned so that they can close the domains concerned.
Processing takes place in the European Union. However, it cannot be ruled out that the domain is registered outside the EEA and, consequently, information is transferred to the registrar or host outside the EEA in order to close it.
e) Sanctions list screening
A sanctions list check involves the screening of persons with whom it is illegal to do business ("Denied Parties"). Such Denied Parties are natural or legal persons who are included on a regulatory authority's list of parties that are blocked from import or export transactions. Shipments to or from such persons can be held back for further scrutiny by
Deutsche Post AG
until it has been verified that onward transport of the shipment is not prohibited. To facilitate the quick release of the shipment, the sender will usually be requested to submit a copy of your identity card or passport. The following data categories are required: type of document, document number, full first name, any name affixes, full surname, date of birth, place of birth. You can make any other data illegible.
The legal basis for processing is either the compliance with a legal obligation pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. c) GDPR in conjunction with EU Regulations (EU) 2580/2001, (EU) 881/2002 and (EU) 753/2011 or a legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR in conjunction with additional lists such as those of the UN and the US OFAC. Depending on circumstances, local, country-specific lists may also be applicable.
Deutsche Post AG
has a legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws, in particular US laws, and not being subject to sanctions by local authorities. In addition,
Deutsche Post AG
must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations along its entire service and shipping chain as part of its international and highly dynamic network.
You have the right to object to the processing of this data. If you do so, the check will be carried out in another way (for example by examining other documents).
The collected ID documents will be deleted after no more than 5 days.
End-to-end encryption is available if you are sending your ID data by e-mail. This means the e-mail containing the copy of your ID card/passport will be encrypted in line with data protection regulations.
f) Participation in customer surveys
DHL Paket GmbH
and
Deutsche Post AG
regularly conduct satisfaction surveys for various areas and use this customer feedback as a basis to continuously improve their products and services. They welcome your participation, which allows you to inform them what they are already doing well and where you would like to see improvements. Your participation in a satisfaction survey is voluntary and is based on your consent; the legal basis is Article 6 (1), first sentence, lit. a) GDPR.
You can ascertain whether or not a satisfaction survey is anonymous either from the e-mail invitation or from information provided in the questionnaire itself. If a satisfaction survey is not anonymous, your responses can be linked to your contact data. We can thus react directly to your responses and contact you if necessary. In such cases, your personal data is used only in order to communicate with you and is handled in compliance with data protection requirements. If surveys are anonymous, your responses are not linked to your contact data. This means we cannot react to your responses or contact you.
Your consent to participation in the satisfaction survey also includes us being allowed to use your responses for advertising purposes. However, unless separately agreed, the use of your responses for advertising purposes is always on an anonymised basis, i.e., without any reference to you as a natural or legal person, or to your company if you are a business customer of ours.
g) Dialogpost manager
Purchaser’s name, address and further contact details
Recipient’s name and address, if applicable
Notification of client’s customer number (EKP)
Bank account data
Order history
The data are processed primarily for the purpose of processing the request pursuant to Article 6 (1)(b) of the GDPR.
In addition, data are processed in accordance with Article 6 (1)(c) of the GDPR to comply with statutory requirements such as Section 99 of the German Penal Code, Section 65 of the German Postal Services Act, regulatory or tax-rated requirements, etc.
If you are not a customer, we process your data in connection with fault messages based on your consent in accordance with Article 6 (1)(a) of the GDPR. This enables us to inform you about the fault status. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future. The withdrawal does not have any influence on the lawfulness of processing on the basis of the consent prior to the withdrawal of such consent.
Finally, the data are also used to collate statistics.
Deutsche Post AG
believes that there are no overriding interests that prevent processing because the extent of the interference with rights by such processing is kept to a minimum, e.g., by means of anonymization and aggregation. Article 6 (1)(1 f) of the GDPR forms the relevant legal basis.
Data are passed on to the companies involved in the provision of postal services. Similarly, data are passed on to comply with statutory requirements (e.g., to investigating authorities). Some customer services and IT services are outsourced to external providers.
The client’s customer number is required for the performance of postal services for third parties (such as letter shops, service providers); we are authorized to notify the service provider of this customer number on the latter’s request provided the identity is ensured.
Your personal data are not generally processed in third countries. However, where items are shipped abroad, the data are transmitted to the postal service in that country in order to perform the contract.

About this policy
Related privacy practices
We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:
Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like
Chrome Incognito
mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.
To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for
key terms
. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can
contact us
.
Information Google collects
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which
ads you’ll find most useful
,
the people who matter most to you online
, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with
unique identifiers
tied to the browser, application, or
device
you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
personal information
.
Things you create or provide to us
When you create a Google Account, you provide us with
personal information
that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a
phone number
or
payment information
to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and
devices
you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.
The information we collect includes
unique identifiers
, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including
IP address
, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and
referrer URL
of your request.
We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an
Android device with Google apps
, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your
device type and carrier name
, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings,
other information about how you’re using your Android device
.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:
Terms you search for
Videos you watch
Views and interactions with content and ads
Voice and audio information
Purchase activity
People with whom you communicate or share content
Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account
If you use our
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages
, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.
You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.
Go to Google Account
Your location information
We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.
Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:
GPS and other
sensor data from your device
IP address
Activity on Google services
, such as from your searches or
places you label like home or work
Information about things near your device
, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices
The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can
turn your Android device’s location on or off
using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on
Location History
if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about
how we use location information
.
In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from
publicly accessible sources
. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to
protect against abuse
. We also receive information from partners to provide
advertising and research services on their behalf
.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including
cookies
,
pixel tags
, local storage, such as
browser web storage
or
application data caches
, databases, and
server logs
.
Why Google collects data
We use data to build better services
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services
We use your information to
deliver our services
, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services
We also use your information to
ensure our services are working as intended
, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to
make improvements
to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and
customized search results
. For example,
Security Checkup
provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you
personalized ads
based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in
My Ad Center
.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on
sensitive categories
, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
Go to My Ad Center
Measure performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to
link information
about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.
Communicate with you
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public
We use information to help improve the
safety and reliability
of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or
the public
.
We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us
detect abuse
such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use
algorithms
to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.
We may
use the information we collect
across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings,
your activity on other sites and apps
may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.
If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls
You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used
This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the
Privacy Checkup
, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our
Product Privacy Guide

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether
information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services
, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.
Go to Activity Controls
Ad settings

And finally, you can also
request to remove content
from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.
There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:
Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a
cookie
in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services
rely on cookies to function properly
, for things like remembering your language preferences.
Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can
modify location settings
on your Android device.
Sharing your information
When you share your information
Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.
When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in
ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting
.
When Google shares your information
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent
We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you
use Google Home to make a reservation
through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any
sensitive personal information
.
With domain administrators
If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your
domain administrator
and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:
Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
Change your account password
Suspend or terminate your account access
Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings
For external processing
We provide personal information to our
affiliates
and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Respond to any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or enforceable governmental request
. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our
Transparency Report
.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our
users
, or the public.
We may share
non-personally identifiable information
publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to
show trends
about the general use of our services. We also allow
specific partners
to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.
If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure
We build security into our services to protect your information
All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.
We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
We offer a range of security features, like
Safe Browsing
, Security Checkup, and
2 Step Verification
to help you protect your account
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Exporting & deleting your information
You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time
You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.
Export your data

Retaining your information
We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:
Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as your
personal info
or the content you create or upload, like
photos
and
documents
. You can also delete
activity information
saved in your account, or
choose to have it deleted automatically
after a set period of time. We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as
advertising data
in server logs.
We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
You can read more about Google’s
data retention periods
, including how long it takes us to delete your information.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We maintain
servers around the world
and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain
legal frameworks
relating to the transfer of data.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
European requirements
How to exercise your rights and contact Google
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the
controls
described in this policy so you can exercise your rights to request access to, update,
remove
, and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.
If you have additional questions or requests related to your rights,
you can contact Google and our data protection office
. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
Data controller
Unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice, the
data controller responsible for processing your information
depends on where you are based:
Google Ireland Limited for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
Google LLC for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
Google LLC is the data controller responsible for processing information indexed and displayed in services like
Google Search
and Google Maps regardless of your location. Google Ireland Limited is the data controller responsible for processing information to train Google’s AI models for the purpose of deploying them in services provided by Google Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.
Legal bases of processing
We process your information for the
purposes
described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
We process your data in order to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract.
We process your data for our legitimate interests and those of
third parties
while applying
appropriate safeguards
that protect your privacy.
We process your data when necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
We process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so.
We ask for your consent to process your data for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
How you use Google services and your privacy settings will determine what data is processed, the purposes for which this data is processed, and the legal bases for processing data. The table below explains these processing purposes, the kinds of data processed, and the legal grounds for processing this data, in more detail.
Why and how we process data
What data is processed
Legal grounds
To provide Google services, products, and features
Examples of processing activities:
We process the terms you search for in order to return results.
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video.
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account.
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share.
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, we use your shipping address or delivery instructions for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
We process your payment information when you buy extra storage for Google Drive.
We can use contact info (like names and email addresses) of people you interact with in Google products to make it easier to find who you’re looking for when you want to share and communicate with these people in other Google services like Gmail, Photos and Assistant.
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail.
Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
We can help you share your location using
Google Location Sharing
, so that others can find you on a map, or know your estimated time of arrival.
As described in the
Sharing your information
section, we’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent, and provide you with controls to
review and manage third party apps and sites
you have given access to data in your Google Account.
The information processed will depend on how you use Google services and your settings but could include the following:
Things you create or provide to us
:
Content you create, upload, or receive (like photos, videos, emails, docs and spreadsheets).

Algorithm
A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.
Application data cache
An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
and how Google uses data, including cookies,
when you use our partners' sites or apps
.
Device
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Google Account
You may access some of our services by signing up for a
Google Account
and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
IP address
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about
how we use location information.
Non-personally identifiable information
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
Personal information
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Pixel tag
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Referrer URL
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
Sensitive personal information
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
123.45.67.89
is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32
is the date and time of the query.
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars
is the requested URL, including the search query.
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7
is the browser and operating system being used.
740674ce2123a969
is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
Unique identifiers
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about
how Google uses cookies
.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be
managed
in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
Activity on Google Services
If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.
In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.

Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.
This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.

ensure and improve
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
ensure our services are working as intended
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
Information about things near your device
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.

legal process, or enforceable governmental request
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our
Transparency Report
.
make improvements
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
may link information
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.

Places you label like home and work
You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.
You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your
Google Account.
protect against abuse
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
publicly accessible sources
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
rely on cookies to function properly

Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.
Learn more
sensitive categories
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we
require the same from advertisers
that use our services.

from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
third parties
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
use the information we collect across our services
Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.
Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.
Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.

If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.
Views and interactions with content and ads
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
Voice and audio information
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.
Learn more
your activity on other sites and apps
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your
account settings
and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.
