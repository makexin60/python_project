Polestar – Car Privacy Notice
v2.3
17.02.2025
What's new
Download as PDF
1. Introduction
This privacy notice explains how Polestar processes car generated data, when you use a Polestar car and connected services provided by Polestar and its partners.
Learn more about who we are and how you can contact us
.
It is important to us to be transparent and that you are informed about how we use your personal data. In this privacy notice, you will find information about the processing of personal data associated with different car features, but you will not find the explanation of the features themselves here – for this,
check the owner’s manual
. This notice takes precedence, in case of any discrepancy between the notice and the owner’s manual with regard to the processing of personal data.
The scope of the data processing activities depends on the model of your car, the services with which your car is equipped, and on the services which you choose to activate. This notice describes the widest extent of processing possible. If you have an older car model, or if a new model is not equipped with a certain feature, the data processing associated with that feature will not occur.
This privacy notice does not apply to:
The provision of the internet service in your car, which is supplied by a mobile network operator independently from Polestar.
Your use of the Google Automotive Services: Polestar cars come with Google built-in, meaning that the infotainment system runs on the Android Automotive operating system offering Google Automotive Services (e.g., Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Store). The infotainment system also offers the possibility to log-in with a Google account. In these instances, Google is the responsible data controller and Polestar is not involved in the processing of your personal data. For more information,
see Google Privacy Policy
. Your use of the Google Automotive Services is further governed by
the Google Terms of Service
and
Google Maps Terms of Service
.
Your use of third-party applications and services in the car: the features available in the Google Play Store are offered by independent vendors, similarly with how they operate on a smartphone. When you connect your vehicle with a third-party application, your personal data and the data related to your vehicle is transferred to the third-party providing the application to enable the connection and your use of the third-party service. For further information, refer to the individual service providers’ own terms and conditions as well as their privacy policies.
Your use of third-party value-added services based on vehicle data (such as pay-as-you-drive insurance).
Polestar has other privacy documents that should be read together with this notice for a complete picture of how your data is used by Polestar. Access them on the links below:

2.2 Road safety and mobility management
Emergency Call (eCall)
Polestar Assistance (Roadside Assistance)
We may process some of your personal data relating to Roadside Assistance for
customer care
and
quality assurance and development
purposes.
Purpose
To provide the roadside assistance services to you, for example in the event of a flat tyre, breakdown, or accident. Polestar Assistance will be able to send suitable help to you whenever you may need assistance.

You will reach Polestar Assistance by either activating the ‘Connect’ button located in the ceiling of the car, using the contact feature in the Polestar app, or calling your local Polestar Assistance Centre. For more information, check
Polestar.com
The Polestar Assistance is supported by our local partners that operate the call centre and provide you with the necessary roadside assistance services. Relevant information may be transmitted to specialised service providers depending on the nature and scope of the requested roadside assistance (e.g., towing service, hotel, etc.).
Categories of personal data
The data collected when requesting roadside assistance: license number, VIN, engine specification, vehicle model specification, time and place of the request, direction of the vehicle travel (not applicable when initiated through the app or by calling us), audio recording including any additional information that you provide in relation to the delivery of requested support. 

Depending on the nature and scope of the request, we may need to process additional information necessary for the delivery of requested assistance, for example: contact information (home address, e-mail address, phone number), insurance details (policy and claim number), transaction-related data, damage cause and information about the workshop handling the repair.
Legal basis
The processing is necessary to provide roadside assistance services (performance of the contract (GDPR, article 6.1 (b)) and to administer your request (legitimate interest GDPR, article 6.1 (f)).

Contact us if you want to learn more about how we balance your interests against ours.
Retention
We retain your data associated with your roadside assistance request in line with applicable laws relating to the financial reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least 8 (eight) years, except for location data that is deleted after 90 (ninety) days. Vehicle service data will become a part of a vehicle’s service history.

Audio recording: Will be recorded for quality assurance purposes. It will be stored for a maximum period of 6 (six) months, in line with the applicable national laws, unless it is specifically necessary to keep a conversation for longer, for instance, because a dispute arose.
Controller(s)
As the data controller, Polestar Performance AB has entered into contractual arrangements with its local partners providing roadside assistance regulated by the applicable data protection laws per country. Depending on the nature and scope of the requested roadside assistance, relevant information may have to be transmitted to a specialized service provider (e.g., towing service, hotel) that is an independent data controller. If you want to learn more about the processing by specialized service providers, refer to their privacy policy.

4.2 Processing of your personal data outside of EU/EEA
We strive to process your personal data within the EU/EEA area. However, Polestar is a company with an international presence.

We transfer personal data to the United States and the United Kingdom for IT system hosting services, IT support services and customer care services.
We always ensure that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA. As regards the United Kingdom, the Commission has decided that it ensures an adequate level of protection (article 45 of the GDPR), but regarding transfers to the United States we have entered into
EU Model Clauses
with all relevant third parties (article 46 of the GDPR) or they are certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework and/or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition, we take additional technical and organisational security measures when needed, such as encryption and pseudonymisation. Our processors supporting delivering the Polestar products and services are limited by contract in their ability to use your personal data for any purpose other than to provide support for us in compliance with each data processing agreement in place
5. Information security
To protect your personal information from loss, theft, and unauthorised access, use, or disclosure, we have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures including encryption of transmitted and stored data, and access right concepts. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure or impenetrable.

if you object to the use. If so, you can request that we limit our use while we investigate if our interest in processing your data outweighs your interests.
Even if you have requested that we restrict our use of your data, we have the right to use it for storage, if we have obtained your consent to use it, to assert or defend legal claims or to protect someone’s rights. We may also use the information for reasons relating to an important public interest.
We will let you know when the restriction expires.
If we limit our use of your data, we will also inform those we have shared your data with (when applicable) - if it is not impossible or too cumbersome. If you ask us, we will also tell you who we have shared your data with.
6.7 Right to data portability
If the processing is based on your consent or an agreement between us, you have the right to obtain personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transfer it to another controller (“data portability”).

In the privacy settings menu in the centre display, you can turn on or off the sharing and usage of your data for specific services. The privacy settings include microphone, location and app permissions and the data sharing options with Polestar and Google.
