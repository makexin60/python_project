Cloud Software Group uses cookies, web beacons (including pixels and tags), and similar technologies on our Online Channels which may read or write information on your device in order to collect certain information about you by automated means. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
We use these automated technologies to collect information about your device or equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner includes IP addresses and other identifiers associated with your devices including Apple Advertising Identifier or Android Advertising ID, types of devices connected to our Offerings, device characteristics (such as operating system), language preferences, referring/exit pages, navigation paths, access times, email open rates, browser preferences and characteristics, installed plugins, local time zones, local storage preferences, clickstream data, and other information about your online activities.
We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other Internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).
The cookies we use on our Online Channels include: strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, analytics cookies, and targeting/advertising cookies, as described below.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
We use strictly necessary cookies on our Online Channels that are necessary for us to provide you with our products and services. These include cookies used to securely authenticate you to our website and identify you after you have logged in and user-centric security cookies used to increase the security of the products and services we provide to you (such as to detect authentication abuses). Given the necessary functionality of these cookies, they typically do not require consent.
Functional Cookies
These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the Online Channels to evaluate and improve our performance. They may also be used to provide a better customer experience on the Online Channels. For example, remembering your log-in details, saving what is in your shopping cart, or providing us information about how our site is used.
Analytics Cookies
We use analytics cookies to collect information on how users navigate and use our Online Channels, such as how the users traverse our Online Channels, the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Online Channels and make the Online Channels more user-friendly. These cookies are provided by third-party analytics providers, including Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit
Google Analytics
. To learn more about these analytics services and how to opt out, please view the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing analytics cookies for.
Advertising Cookies
Advertising cookies are used to control and manage online advertisements. These cookies may collect information on whether a user has reacted to an advertisement and visited another website. Such cookies help us offer you content and provide targeted information that is more relevant to your interests. They also help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements and communications. In the EU, we deploy analytics and advertising cookies on our websites only when users have opted-in as required by applicable law.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Online Channels.

Additional information about our cookie practices and how to manage your cookie preferences is available in the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using cookies or similar tools.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins on our Online Channels (such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook) also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Cloud Software Group is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.
Interest-Based Advertising
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads). We may use such information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks. Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.
The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Cloud Software Group advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

International Data Transfers
We transfer the personal information we collect through the Channels to, and store such data in, other countries in which Cloud Software Group and its service providers operate, including the United States, which may have different data protection laws than the country in which the information was provided. If we do so, we will transfer the personal information only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. To the extent required by applicable law, when we transfer your personal information to recipients in other countries, we will take measures to protect that information including, as appropriate, by executing data transfer agreements based on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses pursuant to article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or by putting in place other appropriate data transfer mechanism(s).
Your Privacy Rights and Choices
To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may have privacy rights to access, correct, update, amend, delete, restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to automated decision-making based on your personal information.
When Cloud Software Group is acting as a “data controller” under applicable law, you may exercise such rights by completing a
Privacy Request form
or by contacting us using the information under the
How To Contact Us
section of this Privacy Statement, or, where applicable, by accessing your Cloud Software Group account. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a charge may apply before we provide you with a copy of any of your personal information that we maintain. Depending on your location, you may have the right to file a complaint with a government regulator if you are not satisfied with our response.
When Cloud Software group is acting as a “data processor” and you wish to exercise your privacy rights of access and request corrections, suppression, or deletion, we will direct you to the data controller under the applicable data protection laws. Alternatively, to exercise any rights relating to personal information processed on behalf of our customers in connection with the use of our products and services, end users may directly contact the relevant customer, not Cloud Software Group.

Communication Preferences
We also offer choices in connection with the personal information we use to communicate with you, such as via email or telephone. To update your email and telephone communication preferences, limit the communications you receive from us, or submit a related request, please contact us as specified in the
How to Contact Us
section of this Privacy Statement. You can also unsubscribe from our email marketing by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our marketing emails.  Please note that unsubscribing from  marketing communications does not affect your receipt of operational communications that are important to your interaction with us or our services, such as communications about the status of your subscription, service changes, support communications, security updates, event registration updates or account management communications.
Interest-Based Advertising Choices
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ("Principles") of the
Digital Advertising Alliance
in the U.S., the
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
, and the
European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance
in the EU. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit
Ad Choices
,

These websites also provide detailed information about interest-based advertising and tips for managing your privacy online and in applications. Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the Online Channels; rather, opting out means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your interests. When you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through the links above, cookies and other technologies on the Online Channels may still collect information about your use of the Online Channels, including for analytics, fraud prevention, and any other purpose permitted under the Self- Regulatory Principles.
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
Cloud Software Group recognizes Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signals where legally required. GPC is a browser setting that a user can set in order to send a signal to websites visited regarding the user’s cookie preferences. If your browser or browser extension has GPC enabled, we will recognize that signal and opt you out of non-essential cookies. For more information about GPC and how to implement GPC opt-out preference signals, please visit

Other Online Preferences
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners, and social media platforms) may collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. Our Online Channels are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from web browsers. However, you can manage your cookie preferences in connection with the personal information we collect about you by clicking on the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for.
Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. This will not affect the lawfulness of our use of your information based on your consent before its withdrawal. You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority or other data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.
Some of the rights described above may be subject to limitations under applicable law.
How We Protect Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Personal Information.

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
We use these automated technologies to collect information about your device or equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner includes IP addresses and other identifiers associated with your devices including Apple Advertising Identifier or Android Advertising ID, types of devices connected to our Offerings, device characteristics (such as operating system), language preferences, referring/exit pages, navigation paths, access times, email open rates, browser preferences and characteristics, installed plugins, local time zones, local storage preferences, clickstream data, and other information about your online activities.
We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other Internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).
The cookies we use on our Online Channels include: strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, analytics cookies, and targeting/advertising cookies, as described below.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
We use strictly necessary cookies on our Online Channels that are necessary for us to provide you with our products and services. These include cookies used to securely authenticate you to our website and identify you after you have logged in and user-centric security cookies used to increase the security of the products and services we provide to you (such as to detect authentication abuses). Given the necessary functionality of these cookies, they typically do not require consent.
Functional Cookies
These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the Online Channels to evaluate and improve our performance. They may also be used to provide a better customer experience on the Online Channels. For example, remembering your log-in details, saving what is in your shopping cart, or providing us information about how our site is used.
Analytics Cookies
We use analytics cookies to collect information on how users navigate and use our Online Channels, such as how the users traverse our Online Channels, the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Online Channels and make the Online Channels more user-friendly. These cookies are provided by third-party analytics providers, including Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit

Interest-Based Advertising
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads). We may use such information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks. Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.
The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Cloud Software Group advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.

Your Privacy Rights and Choices
To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may have privacy rights to access, correct, update, amend, delete, restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to automated decision-making based on your personal information.
When Cloud Software Group is acting as a “data controller” under applicable law, you may exercise such rights by completing a
Privacy Request form
or by contacting us using the information under the

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
We use these automated technologies to collect information about your device or equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns.

We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other Internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).
The cookies we use on our Online Channels include: strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, analytics cookies, and targeting/advertising cookies, as described below.

We use strictly necessary cookies on our Online Channels that are necessary for us to provide you with our products and services. These include cookies used to securely authenticate you to our website and identify you after you have logged in and user-centric security cookies used to increase the security of the products and services we provide to you (such as to detect authentication abuses). Given the necessary functionality of these cookies, they typically do not require consent.

Interest-Based Advertising
When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads).

Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.
The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Cloud Software Group advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.

Your Privacy Rights and Choices
To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may have privacy rights to access, correct, update, amend, delete, restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to automated decision-making based on your personal information.
When Cloud Software Group is acting as a “data controller” under applicable law, you may exercise such rights by completing a

Sensitive Candidate Personal Information is Candidate Personal Information concerning nationality or citizenship, race or ethnic origin, criminal history, trade union membership, or other protected category of personal information under applicable privacy and data protection laws.
What Candidate Personal Information We Collect
We collect Candidate Personal Information the following ways:
Directly From You. You may use various electronic and paper methods to submit Candidate Personal Information to Us. The primary method is through our online application processing application (Workday), through interviews and other direct interactions with you.
Indirectly From You. For example, from your actions on Our talent acquisition websites and applications or from information your computer or mobile device transmits when interacting with such websites and applications.
From Third Parties. In addition, to the extent permitted by law, We may collect Candidate Personal Information from third parties, for example, from recruiters, in connection with a background, credit, or employment check or an employment reference (subject to your consent where required by law), from a recruiting or other publicly-available web site, such as your professional LinkedIn profile, your professional profile on your current employer’s website, speaker bios on the websites of professional conferences where you have spoken, or articles you have published.

In addition to the above, we may collect Sensitive Candidate Personal Information. For example, we may collect criminal background information when we perform background and criminal checks where permitted by law. We may also process other Sensitive Candidate Personal Information, such as citizenship or nationality information or health information, in order to evaluate a potential reasonable accommodation in the talent acquisition and hiring process where requested, for equal opportunity monitoring, when relevant for a position and permitted by law. We process Sensitive Candidate Data for these purposes when we are required to do so by law or if you have given your explicit consent.
If you have a disability and would like Us to consider a reasonable accommodation, you may provide that information during the talent acquisition process.
How We Use Candidate Personal Information
We process Candidate Personal Information for legitimate human resources and business management purposes.  These include identifying and evaluating candidates for Our positions; communicating with you including notifying you of relevant additional vacancies that may interest you; record-keeping related to hiring processes; analyzing the hiring process and outcomes; and conducting background checks, where permitted by law.

In addition, Candidate Personal Information may be used to comply with Our legal, regulatory, and corporate governance requirements.
Why & With Whom We Disclose or Share Candidate Personal Information
We may share your Candidate Personal Information internally within Cloud Software Group and/or its affiliates for the purposes described in this notice.

Third-party service providers include talent acquisition operations, communication, and verification providers used for the purposes of managing, coordinating, documenting and analyzing our talent acquisition efforts, facilitating communications, marketing, and employment verification. Third-party service providers may also include external advisors (e.g., auditors and legal advisors), insurance carriers, benefits providers, and  compliance and investigation teams (including external advisers appointed to conduct internal investigations).  Such third-party service providers have access to Candidate Personal Information solely for the purpose of performing the services specified in the applicable service contract, and We require the service providers to undertake security measures consistent with the protections specified in this Notice.

You may exercise such rights by completing a
Privacy Request form
