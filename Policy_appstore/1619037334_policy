（A）How do we collect your information
(1) Registering as a Member
We provide membership services to you through a Doorzo platform. To use our membership services, you need to create a Doorzo account and provide your email address and password.
If you provide a nickname and profile, they will be publicly displayed. If you choose not to provide this information, it will not affect your ability to browse, bookmark, or purchase on Doorzo.
(2) Shipping Address Information
When you engage in shopping activities, we will need you to provide your shipping address and contact phone number so that we can provide logistics services for you. If you do not provide this information, we will not be able to provide shopping services for you.
If you already have a Doorzo account, we may display your aforementioned personal information (excluding shipping address information) and the actions you perform on the platform, including showing your profile, benefits, and transaction orders through the platform account. We will respect your choices regarding platform services and platform account settings.
(B) How We Use Your Information
(1) Displaying Product or Service Information to You
To show you product or service information that better meets your needs, we collect and use your browsing and search records, device information, and login information when you visit or use the platform.  Specifically:
Device Information: Based on your specific operations during access and/or use, we receive and record device-related information (including device model, operating system version, device settings, MAC address and IMEI, IDFA, OAID, and other device identifiers, device environment, mobile app lists, and hardware and software information). We also collect device location-based information (including GPS location authorized by you, WLAN access points, Bluetooth, and base station sensor information).
Service Log-in Information: When you access or use products or services provided on the platform website or APP, we automatically collect and record detailed usage information as service logs, including browsing history, click records, search queries, favorites, items added to the cart, transactions, after-sales activities, sharing and posting information, as well as IP addresses, browser types, telecommunications carriers, language settings, access dates, and times.
Please note that individual device information and service log information cannot identify a specific natural person. If we combine this type of non-personal information with other information to identify a specific natural person, or if we use it in combination with personal information, during the period of combination, this non-personal information will be treated as personal information. Unless authorized by you or required by law, we will anonymize and de-identify such information.
(2) Providing You with Favorites, Cart Addition, Follow, and Share Functions
While browsing our website or APP, you can choose your favorite items and add them to your shopping cart, establish relationships with merchants/brands/other members you are interested in, and share product/service information with third parties through the functionality components we provide. During your usage of these functions, we collect service login information, including records of your favorites and cart additions, follow relationships, and sharing history, to achieve the aforementioned functions and other purposes explicitly communicated to you.
(3) Assisting You in Placing Orders and Order Management
When you place orders for specific products and/or services on our platform, we generate orders for purchasing these products and/or services through our system. During the ordering process, you are required to provide at least your name, shipping address, and contact phone number. The order will also include details of the purchased items and/or services, a specific order number, order creation time, the amount you need to pay, and any remarks you provide. We collect this information to help you complete transactions smoothly, ensure the security of your transactions, facilitate order inquiries, provide customer service and after-sales support, and for other purposes explicitly communicated to you.
You can place orders for others through Doorzo. In such cases, you need to provide the others' personal information of the actual receiver and ensure that you have obtained their permission.
To help you understand, inquire, and manage order information, we collect order information generated during your usage of our services to display to you and facilitate your order management.

You can view and manage your order information through the "My Orders" section.

We will share your Doorzo order payment-related information, order security-related device information, and other necessary information required by anti-money laundry laws with payment companies through embedded payment software development kits (SDKs) in the application.
To ensure that we are promptly informed and confirm the progress and status of your payment, we provide you with after-sales and dispute resolution services, you agree that we may collect payment-related information from your chosen transaction partner or other financial institutions you select.
(5) Assisting in Completing the Delivery of Goods or Services to You
In order to ensure smooth, safe, and accurate delivery of your purchased products or services, we will transfer order-related delivery information to the logistics information system and technology service providers for Doorzo. They will then synchronize this information with the chosen logistics delivery entity based on your selection of product or service provider. You understand and agree that the corresponding logistics delivery entity unavoidably gains access to and uses your delivery information for completing the delivery.

At the same time, our professional security team will strengthen the security of personal information (including reporting of sensitive information, encryption of sensitive information storage, access control, etc.).
