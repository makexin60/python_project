Introduction
How Remini protects your images and other data
We want to help you understand how Remini processes your personal data, as well your options when it comes to managing it. It’s important that you also understand how Remini protects your images and videos.
You’ll find all this information in our privacy policy, which is below.
The following bullets highlight a few key details about the app and our security measures:
Remini is a photo- and video-editing app. It enhances photos and videos by improving aspects such as image resolution and colors. Also, it gives you the ability to generate new images with AI.
Remini's technologies are not used to identify or authenticate people in the images or videos.
You retain control over the images and videos you upload, enhance, and generate using Remini. We don’t sell, trade, or claim ownership of any of your images or videos—no matter whether you use Remini to edit your existing images or videos or to generate new ones.
Your images and videos aren’t used to train our AI technologies, unless you explicitly opt in for that.
Your images and videos are safeguarded with appropriate security measures, following privacy and data protection laws and industry standards. This includes encryption and cloud storage for enhanced security.
To know how we process your personal data when using Remini, please refer to the privacy policy.

Types of data, how data is used, and retention: Activities that we perform by default when you use the app
The following activities are always performed when you use our app. This means that if you decide to access the app and make use of its features, your personal data will be used for the purposes listed in this section. If you choose not to provide your personal data, you won’t be able to use the app.
a)
Service delivery
We use your personal data to enable you to use the app, and to provide you with its functionalities. Examples of using the app include editing and enhancing your photos and videos, and generating AI images of yourself. Examples of the functionalities provided include the information shown to you about the app and your editing process, and the suggestions made about the best photos or videos  to edit.
Categories of data.
The following data is used:
User identifiers
(such as Apple ID) and

Device information
(such as device model, device type, OS version, device language, device name, and region)
Information about your
subscription
Information about your
interaction with the app
Images and videos
that you upload, and
images and videos generated
by the app (such as enhanced photos and videos and AI images). To edit photos and videos or generate AI images, the app needs access to your library and your camera. You have to expressly allow this access through the request pop-up that appears on your device. When you allow access to your library and upload the first image for AI generation, Remini may find and automatically select other images in your gallery that feature the same person represented in the uploaded image. Until you decide to upload such images, the images don’t leave your device and are not stored on our servers.
Metadata
and other information extracted from the images that you upload for enhancement (for example, gender, age, skin tone)
Information about faces in the images and videos you upload, including, for example, information that estimates the location and shape of facial features (”
face data
”). Depending on the applicable law of your jurisdiction,  face data may be considered biometric data.  We use face data only to enhance your photos and videos and create the AI images you request, unless you specifically consent to other processing of this data. In no instance does Remini process face data to identify or authenticate people in images or videos you upload.

Additional information for users in Illinois
In accordance with Illinois law, this section provides additional disclosures related to face data. As described in the section
Types of data collected, how this data is used, and data retention periods
, we collect and process face data to enhance your photos and videos and generate AI images. We don’t collect or use face data to improve our generative features nor to train our photo-video editor algorithms. We retain personal data as described in the section
Types of data collected, how this data is used, and data retention periods
. We use cloud storage providers to store face data. We’ll never sell, lease, or trade face data to third parties. As described above, face data may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions. Face data is not used to identify or authenticate individuals in the photos and videos you upload.
Changes to this privacy policy
We may modify, integrate, or update—in whole or in part—this privacy policy. We’ll notify users of any modification, integration, or update in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
If we make modifications, we’ll notify you by revising the date at the bottom of this privacy policy and, under certain circumstances, we may also notify you by additional means (such as via email, pop-up, or push notification).
In-app tracking technologies
When we refer to “tracking technology” or “tracking technologies” in this policy, we mean any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device, including SDKs, tracking pixels, HTML5 local storage, local shared objects, and fingerprinting techniques.
Tracking technologies are usually classified by purpose (technical, analytics, profiling) and by publisher (first-party, third-party). The legal requirements vary based on these classifications.
The tracking technology classifications and some practical examples now follow.
By purpose
Technical tracking technologies
These are used to transmit messages over an electronic communication network or to provide a service specifically requested by the user. Therefore, they’re necessary for the app to function correctly, and for providing the service requested by and offered to the user.
For example, technical tracking technologies can be used to monitor sessions, store specific server access information related to the user configuration, facilitate the use of online content, keep track of items in a shopping cart, or keep track of information used to fill in a form.
As technical tracking technologies are necessary, they don’t
need your consent.
Analytics tracking technologies
These are used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, evaluate and improve the design of an app, or help measure traffic. In other words, they serve to track the traffic and performance of an app by collecting aggregate data on the number of users and how they interact with the app, which helps to improve its services.
For example, analytics tracking technologies may collect information about how users access an app, including the number of users and potentially grouped by geographical area, time zone, how long they stay on the app, which parts of the app they interact with, and the number of users who used a particular feature.
Normally, analytics tracking technologies are used only with your explicit consent. However, in the following cases they’re treated like technical trackers, so don’t need your consent:
When they’re used only to produce aggregated statistics that are performed through the controller’s own resources and that don’t turn into activities that go beyond statistical counting and assisting business-related decision-making
When the third parties don’t match the analytics trackers' data with any other information, and don’t send any data gathered to other third parties
Profiling tracking technologies
These are used to evaluate some personal aspects of certain users, and to trace specific actions or recurring behavioral patterns in the use of the app in relation to specific, identified or identifiable individuals, so they can be grouped within homogeneous, multi-sized clusters. This enables the company to analyze and predict personal elements, provide users with customized services beyond what’s strictly necessary for the delivery of the service, and sending targeted advertising messages in line with the preferences they express during their in-app activities. These serve to convey behavioral advertising, measure the effectiveness of ads, and customize the services offered in line with the user’s monitored behavior.
For example, profiling tracking technologies can be used for the following activities:
To create user profiles and offer content in line with the user’s interests
To send targeted ads or messages
To conduct statistical analysis or other research activities to improve our products and services and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns
Profiling tracking technologies are used only with your explicit consent.
