4.  Sources of personal data
Information collected directly from you
Before using BlackBerry Solutions, you may be required to agree to an applicable supplemental notice that may contain additional information regarding BlackBerry’s Processing of your personal data.
If you provide BlackBerry with personal data about another person, you are responsible for ensuring that you have that individual’s consent to do so or that you are otherwise legally authorized to do so.
Information from third parties
We may receive information about you from our partners you’ve engaged with, as well as information about you or your company from third-party service providers to supplement the information you provided directly to us. This enables us to provide more relevant information about our company, products and services to you.
Use of third-party cookies
BlackBerry and its partners, including advertising networks, use cookies and other tracking technologies to manage our advertising delivered on other sites. We may display targeted advertisements to you while you are using our apps, visiting other company’s websites based on information we obtain from you, or from third parties. The use of cookies is discussed in the
BlackBerry Cookie Notice
.
5.  Sharing of your personal data
We do not sell, lease, or trade the personal data we collect from you. We may transfer your personal data to other BlackBerry entities for the purposes outlined in this Policy. We may provide access or transfer your personal data to authorized BlackBerry personnel, and third-party service providers, including service providers and processors as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), respectively. This includes third-party service providers who help us market, provide support, maintain or service BlackBerry Solutions, or otherwise support our business operations.
The personal data shared with BlackBerry entities may include: your contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address, country/region, company name, and job title, along with your recent interactions with our business applications, and event attendance.
BlackBerry also utilizes third-party service providers, such as advertising networks, to deliver targeted advertisements using aggregated personal data that is derived from profile data Processed by BlackBerry and provides such third-parties with general statistics relating to the advertisements delivered. Please visit “
Withdrawing your consent
” below for more information on managing marketing or commercial communications from BlackBerry.
BlackBerry requires our third-party service providers to take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard your personal data, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to not use your personal data for other purposes unless you have provided consent, or an alternative lawful basis exists to do so.
Because BlackBerry must comply with applicable laws including local legislation, regulations and the orders of courts or other lawful authorities, other lawful requests, or official legal processes, or pursue our legitimate interests to enforce or establish our legal rights, we may sometimes be required to disclose your personal data to government agencies and law enforcement officials. Necessary circumstances when this may occur include response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process or as required by law or to prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud or software piracy, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or in cases where we believe our intellectual property rights may be violated. For more information, please visit
BlackBerry’s Lawful Access Principles and other Corporate Responsibility Practices
and
BlackBerry’s Transparency Report
.
We may also provide access to, assign, or disclose your personal data, where absolutely necessary, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, or purchase of all or a portion of our company assets.
6.  Information sharing to support Third-Party Offerings
When you download software or utilize services provided by third parties (a “Third-Party Offering”), personal data from your computer or device or other BlackBerry Solutions may be accessed by such third parties. When you purchase or use a Third-Party Offering, such as a product, service or software, a paid content subscription service or downloaded application, BlackBerry may share certain personal data with the third-party for purposes of providing you with the Third-Party offering and your personal data will then be subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. We encourage all our users to learn about the privacy practices of such third parties before agreeing to purchase or obtain their products, services or software.
BlackBerry uses contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the personal data is being Processed by our service providers. It is BlackBerry’s policy to enter into confidentiality obligations or employ other lawful data transfer mechanisms with any third-party that obtains confidential information including personal data from BlackBerry to ensure it is adequately protected.
7.  International transfers of your personal data
BlackBerry is committed to ensuring continuity of adequate protection and lawful Processing of personal data regardless of the jurisdiction. Where it has a legal basis to do so, BlackBerry may transfer your personal data outside of your country to a subsidiary, a third-party service provider, or business partner to operate our business and to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy. By virtue of this Policy you are aware that when using our websites or providing any personal data to us, where applicable law permits and unless otherwise specified in a separate specific notice, the Processing of such information may take place outside the country of collection where data protection standards may be different. We will always seek to localize personal data when possible. Several lawful bases exist for BlackBerry to ensure adequacy of data protection when engaging in cross border transfers. BlackBerry will also execute a Data Processing Addendum to facilitate the lawful transfer and adequate protection of personal data across jurisdictions as required by applicable data protection laws.
Transfers to Canada from EU based on adequacy
BlackBerry is a Canadian company headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario. For lawful transfers of personal data to Canada from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) / United Kingdom of Great Britain (“UK”), BlackBerry relies on the EU’s / UK recognition of the adequacy of Canada’s Privacy law, the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), as a lawful mechanism for the transfer of personal data to recipients subject to PIPEDA, which governs how BlackBerry can collect, use, and disclose personal data. Since 2001, PIPEDA has given Canada the benefit of an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. This decision is an acknowledgement by the EU Commission / UK that PIPEDA affords an adequate level of personal data protection to customers that entrust personal data to BlackBerry and allows transfers on the basis of an adequacy determination pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR..
Transfers under EU Standard Contractual Clauses and UK Data Transfer Addendum
As a Data Processor under GDPR, BlackBerry regularly executes with its EU and UK customers or customers with GDPR compliance obligations (Data Controllers) Data Protection Addenda that incorporate the current EU Standard Contractual Clauses and UK Data Transfer Addendum to ensure an adequate level of protection throughout the data Processing lifecycle. This includes BlackBerry’s use of third-party service providers, who are required to Process personal data under comparable terms and conditions.
8.  How we protect your personal data
We take commercially reasonable measures, including physical, administrative and technical safeguards, to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, destruction and disclosure. Despite our taking reasonable security precautions and processes, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect all data we collect and Process, we cannot guarantee the security of any data you transmit to or from our sites, and you do so at your own risk. If you have reason to believe that your Personal Data may no longer be secure (for example, if you feel that the security of an account has been compromised), please
notify us immediately
.
BlackBerry products and services maintain certifications including ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27018:2015. BlackBerry also undergoes AICPA Service Organization Control (SOC 2 Type 2) audits each year for specific products and services. These reports are made available to our clients and partners under a suitable non-disclosure agreement. For more details about which certifications are applicable to the product or service you are using, please see our
BlackBerry Certifications
page.
9.  How long we store your personal data
We retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with our legal obligations, and contractual and business operational requirements. With relation to personal data collected by BlackBerry Solutions, we retain information during the term of the agreement, based upon instructions provided by our customers, or for shorter periods of time as described in the applicable
Product Privacy Data Sheet
or other product or service documentation.
At the expiry of the applicable data retention periods, BlackBerry will take steps to have your personal data deleted, aggregated or made anonymous, unless further retention is required by applicable laws. Consistent with good business practice, BlackBerry continues to evolve our controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to your personal data.
10.  Marketing communications from BlackBerry
BlackBerry may communicate information, surveys, marketing materials, advertisements or customized content which has been personalized to make it more relevant to you as part of your existing business relationship with BlackBerry. For example, we may do so where you have not unsubscribed from receiving such communications and it is permitted by law, where you have explicitly agreed to receive such communications, where you use free services which rely upon advertising (including targeted advertising based on profile information), or through utilizing aggregated data or data that has been made anonymous. BlackBerry may ask you from time to time if you would like to receive additional announcements, news, offers or event invitations regarding BlackBerry and BlackBerry Solutions. You may also choose to provide BlackBerry with personal data in response to various BlackBerry promotions. If you agree to participate in contests, surveys, giveaways, reviews, or other promotions that BlackBerry sponsors or co-sponsors, please ensure that you read the notice that may be associated with these initiatives in order to obtain further details about how your personal data will be managed.

11.  Service-related communications from BlackBerry
BlackBerry may also send you certain service-related communications. For example, BlackBerry may send a welcome email or message when you first activate a BlackBerry Offering to inform you about the service and its terms, to notify you of important changes, to tell you how to manage your credentials or account, to provide service infrastructure notifications or information about upgrades or updates, to provide warranty information, product recall information, safety or security information, or for surveys of current or former users. Because such service-related communications are necessary for the use of your BlackBerry Solutions, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.
12.  Your personal data rights
At BlackBerry we aim to provide the transparency you need to exercise your rights. Below you will find information on your personal data rights as well as how to make requests.
If you are a resident in the EEA/UK and covered by the (UK) GDPR, BlackBerry is the Data Controller of your personal data, except where BlackBerry Solutions have been deployed within an organization, such as your workplace or business, where BlackBerry would then act as a Data Processor under the GDPR.
If you are a resident of the State of California, your rights are addressed in this Policy under Your California privacy rights and BlackBerry’s practices.
Depending on the jurisdiction where you are located, you may also have the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority to lodge a complaint against BlackBerry.
Accessing, rectifying and deleting your personal data
Upon written request, BlackBerry will inform you whether it holds personal data about you and provide you with your personal data within a reasonable timeframe and at minimal or no cost in accordance with applicable laws. If you identify an inaccuracy or incompleteness in your personal data, BlackBerry will amend your information and notify any third parties as required by applicable laws.
Upon written request, and to the extent authorized under applicable law, BlackBerry will also erase any personal data it holds about you using reasonably appropriate technical measures when:
it is no longer necessary to Process your personal data;
you withdraw your consent to Processing unless some other lawful basis exists for BlackBerry to continue to Process your personal data;
you object to the Processing and no overriding legitimate grounds exist for BlackBerry to Process your personal data;
the personal data has not been lawfully Processed by BlackBerry; or

You may exercise aforementioned rights at any time by notifying the BlackBerry Privacy Office at

.
In certain situations, and depending on applicable laws, BlackBerry may not be able to provide you a copy of your personal data it holds about you if access may adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. For example, BlackBerry may not provide access to personal data if doing so:
would likely reveal personal data about a third-party;
would reveal BlackBerry or third-party confidential information;
could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;
includes information that is protected by solicitor or attorney client privilege; or
includes information that was Processed in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law.
In order to safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access, BlackBerry may ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your personal data.
Depending on the circumstances and subject to applicable laws, BlackBerry may deny processing your request or charge a reasonable fee if:
we are unable to verify and authenticate your identity;
it is unreasonably repetitive or automated; or
otherwise excessive, for example if the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass BlackBerry or its employees with no other purpose pursued than to cause disruption.
13.  Withdrawing your consent
At any time, you may withdraw your consent for BlackBerry to Process your personal data in the future in accordance with this Policy (to the extent we base Processing on consent), subject to legal or contractual restrictions. For example, although you can use BlackBerry Solutions for some purposes without providing us with any personal data, BlackBerry may need to Process personal data for some services, including those that require payment or involve an ongoing relationship such as registration or subscription services. As such, BlackBerry may continue to use your personal data as may be required to provide you with requested services, and to the extent that BlackBerry is contractually obligated to do so or as necessary to enforce any contractual obligations you may have with BlackBerry. If you refuse to provide BlackBerry with the personal data it requires or later withdraw your consent to use and disclose this information, BlackBerry may no longer be able to provide you with your BlackBerry Solutions.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by notifying the Privacy Office at BlackBerry at

We use personal data provided in a verifiable consumer request solely to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
These requests may be made only by you, your parent, guardian (if you are under 18 years or age), conservator, a person to whom you have given power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, or an authorized agent. As permitted under California Law, we may request that an individual submitting a request on behalf of a consumer submit proof that they are an authorized agent of the subject consumer, as well as verify the consumer’s identity. To protect your personal data, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent that does not submit adequate proof that you authorized them to act for you.
We are only required to respond to a verifiable consumer Right to Know request twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information to allow us to verify you (or an authorized agent) are the person about whom we collected personal data.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Once we have verified a request from a California resident, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 days and explain how we will process the request. We will then respond to the request within 45 days. We may require an additional 45 days (for a total of 90 days) to process your request, but in those situations, we will provide you a response and explanation for the reason it will take more than 45 days to respond to the request. Our responses will include required information under California Law.
