Welcome to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, where each day thousands of travellers arrive and depart, where retailers welcome shoppers and which is the location of a wide range of enterprises. At Schiphol Nederland B.V. (‘Schiphol’), we take pride in making everyone feel welcome and safe. And protecting your privacy is an important part of this. This privacy statement offers you a transparent and accessible overview of how Schiphol treats your personal data. This privacy statement sets out which personal data we collect, how long we retain this data and which rights you can exercise.
Many people believe that we at Schiphol collect more information about you than is actually the case. There are also other enterprises located at Schiphol that process your personal data, such as the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, Dutch Customs, airlines and the operators of retail units and catering establishments. As a rule, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol does not have access to the personal data they process. If you want to know how they treat your personal data, please consult the websites of these organisations.
In this privacy statement, we describe for each service that Schiphol offers the personal data that we process, why we do this and how long we retain those data. Click on the topic to find out more.
