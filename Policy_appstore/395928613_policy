Non-Identifiable Data:
When you utilize the Site, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about your use of the Site. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
In operating this Site, we may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host our Site give to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.

On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.

Aggregated Personal Data:
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we may conduct research on our end user’s demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information
