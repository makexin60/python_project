Part 1 – Alert Program Privacy Policy
Last update:
April 17, 2024
Your privacy is invaluable. That's why we take the protection and confidentiality of personal information you entrust us with very seriously.
To generate prevention notifications, maintain the Desjardins Insurance Home-Auto mobile application or meet our legal obligations, we need to collect, use and disclose certain personal information.
It's our responsibility to ensure that all data and personal information collected is handled securely. This is the basis of our Alert Program Privacy Policy and how we apply it. It explains why we collect your personal information, 
how we handle it and how we protect it.
Getting your consent
What is my consent to the collection, use and disclosure of my personal information?
By giving your consent, you authorize us to collect, use and disclose your personal information to allow you to participate in the Alert program and meet our legal obligations.
We will get your consent directly from you to allow us to collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the Policy.
If you have to provide us with personal information about another person (like one of your emergency contacts), make sure you have their consent before doing so. You'll also need to let that person know that we will collect, use and 
disclose their personal information for the purposes stated in the Policy or in accordance with applicable laws.
We collect, use and disclose only the personal information that is necessary, unless we have obtained your prior consent or we are permitted or required by law to do otherwise.
This consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is required for participation in the Alert program and takes precedence over any previous consent provided in connection with the program. Your consent 
will remain valid for as long as you use the application or the Alert program is activated in it.
Can I withdraw my consent to collect, use and disclose my personal information or refuse to provide certain personal information?
Downloading the application and activating the Alert program are entirely voluntary. If you do not agree to certain personal information management and protection practices or to the Terms and Conditions, you should not activate the 
Alert program in the application. If it is already activated, you should stop using it. Please refer to the Alert Program Terms and Conditions for more information.
If you decide to
withdraw your consent
to the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information necessary for participating in the Alert program and meeting our legal obligations, we may not be able to offer 
you the program. Your eligibility for certain advantages and discounts on your home insurance policy for subscribing to a professional monitoring service may no longer be available to you.
Collecting only what's necessary
What personal information is being collected about me and how is it collected?
We collect your personal information from 4 main sources:
Directly from you
When you browse our website
When you use the application
From Roost
A) Directly from you
When you communicate with us, regardless of the method used (for example by telephone, email or online chat), we ask you to provide personal information. For example, we need to identify you by asking you to answer authentication 
questions.
The same approach applies if you contact us to get information about the Alert program or the application, request a refund or make a complaint.
In addition, for us or an affiliated general insurance company to offer you home insurance discounts you might be eligible for, we ask you to provide your insurance policy number and your date of birth.
B) When you browse our website
When you browse our website, we collect the address of the website you visited and the language you viewed it in.
When you use our application or visit our website, your information may be stored in cookies and other mobile and web measurement tools that we or third parties install on your computer or device. Cookies help tailor your experience 
interacting with the application or our website.
If you'd like to learn more about what cookies are, which web and mobile measurement tools we use, how we use them and what your options are with regard to these technologies, see our
practices for the use of cookies and other technologies
.
C) When you use the application
Once you've downloaded the application, in order to create your account and confirm your identity, we ask you to provide us with personal information like your first and last name, province, email address and cellphone number.
When you set up your security system in the application, we collect the home address where the system is installed and the serial number for the system's smart base (MAC address).
We also collect data and personal information about your use of the security system within the application:
Security system status (armed or disarmed)
Name of each device connected to the security system that you enter in the application
Security system settings that can be changed in the application
First and last name and telephone number of the emergency contacts that you choose to put in the application
We temporarily collect the various system passwords (4-digit codes) that you create and assign in the application to be used by you, other security system users and designated emergency contacts. We do not store these passwords; they 
are recorded directly into your security system by Roost.
Finally, we collect data about the connection settings for your home Wi-Fi network that you use to keep the security system connected to the internet and working.
D) From Roost
Once your security system is installed and working, we collect certain data and personal information from Roost about events detected by the devices connected to your system's smart base. The data and personal information described 
below is first collected securely by Roost from your system through your home's Wi-Fi network or the cellular network. Then it is securely provided to us in real time using an anonymous identification number to protect your personal information.
The following data and personal information are collected by the security system devices (meaning the smart base, keypad, door and window contacts, motion detector, water and freeze detectors, and/or smoke alarm listener):
Date and time of the event detected by the device
Device battery charge level
Wi-Fi network and cellular network connection quality
System or a system device connectivity, as applicable
Device AC or battery power status
Security system status (armed or disarmed)
User ID of the person who changed the security system status
Silent panic alarm initiation events
Motion detection events
Water or freeze detection events
Humidity level at a given time
Temperature at a given time
Open and close events for each door and window contact
Smoke alarm sound detection event
Roost also provides us with your professional monitoring service subscription status.
How long will my personal information be collected?
Your information is collected as soon as you create your account in the application. It continues to be collected for as long as your security system is installed and active in your application or connected to the internet. Only 
devices that are compatible with Roost's security system can be connected to the smart base.
The security system temporarily or permanently stops collecting data if any of the following happen:
One or more devices are not correctly connected to the smart base
The smart base is connected neither to the Wi-Fi network nor the cellular network
You stop participating in the Alert program by uninstalling your security system from your home and from the smart base settings in the application
We or Roost terminate your participation in the Alert program for the reasons stated in the Terms and Conditions or the Alert program is discontinued
Being transparent about our practices
What do you use my personal information for?
We use your personal information for the purposes identified below and to meet our legal obligations.
We'll inform you if we plan to use your personal information for any other purpose, unless we are legally authorized to use it otherwise.
As such, before we can serve you and provide you with the Alert program, we must:
Identify you
Confirm who is participating in the Alert program by verifying that you are who you say you are (identify you and validate your identity).
Ensure that your personal information is still accurate, complete and up to date before we use it; however, it is your responsibility to inform us of any changes.
Assess your eligibility for the Alert program
Assess whether you meet the eligibility requirements for the Alert program.
Offer you the benefits of the Alert program
Send you notifications in the application or by text message, according to your communication preferences, in the event of smoke, a break-in, a water leak, freezing temperatures or a power outage. You can prevent the application 
from sending you notifications at any time by changing your communication preferences in the application. However, if you disable notifications, it could affect your ability to react to events detected by the system devices.
Offer you or enable you to be offered home insurance premium discounts you might be eligible for from us or an affiliated general insurance company, as applicable.
Design statistical models to deliver products, services and other advantages in connection with the Alert program that meet your needs.
[ 1 ]
note
Maintain the application you downloaded and the Alert program you activated.
Communicate with you about the Alert program and your application by email, mail or telephone.
Handle inquiries, complaints and dissatisfaction.
Manage the risks associated with our activities

[ 1 ]
note
Develop, maintain and improve internal audit systems, processes, methods, practices and procedures.
Design statistical models and build dashboards, indicators and other types of reports to assess and further develop our insurance risk management mechanisms.
[ 1 ]
note
Find, identify and assess risks to continuously improve the Alert program and the application.
Design statistical models and build dashboards, indicators and other types of reports to monitor operations and ensure the security of your information.
[ 1 ]
note
We must also use your personal information to meet our legal obligations to prevent cyber threats, fraud and other financial crimes, and respond to information requests, warrants and orders from courts and other 
organizations.
We do not use your email address or your cellphone number to contact you about products and services other than those in the Alert program, unless we've received your consent to do so.
In addition, if you are insured by us, we do not use the personal information collected to cancel or nullify your home insurance or to refuse to renew it. We do not use the personal information collected to your disadvantage in the 
event an insurance claim is made by or against you. Finally, we do not use the personal information collected to increase or decrease your home insurance premiums. If you are insured by an affiliated general insurance company, your information is also 
not collected or used by the applicable affiliated general insurance company in the manner described above.
Who has access to my personal information?
Access to your information is limited to our employees, service providers, consultants, agents, and representatives who need access to it to perform their duties.
Our employees and consultants commit annually to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they need while performing their duties and must regularly take security and privacy training.
Affiliated general insurance companies
Certain personal information may be disclosed between us and an affiliated general insurance company that you have a home insurance policy with, if applicable, for the purpose of confirming your eligibility for any discounts.
Courts, authorities and other agencies
Certain situations require us to disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement authorities and other agencies.
This may be necessary to prevent cyber threats, fraud and other financial crimes, to respond to requests, warrants and orders, or to meet our insurance obligations.
Suppliers and partners
We may disclose personal information about you to suppliers and partners.
Suppliers and partners could include, but are not limited to, the following:
Information technology services and products companies
Consulting firms mandated by us
Cloud, web-hosting and data-processing services
Legal services
Partners and suppliers must contractually agree to comply with and abide by our strict standards for the protection and confidentiality of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We entrust our suppliers and partners with the personal information they need to perform their duties, functions and contractual obligations with us.
In addition to being subject to confidentiality obligations, the employees of suppliers who have access to personal information must also fully comply with our contractual requirements. Lastly, our suppliers and partners must apply 
adequate physical, information technology and administrative security measures.
More specifically, we provide Roost with only the personal information and data that is necessary to provide you with the Alert program. Personal information is securely transmitted through a wireless network using an anonymous 
identification number to protect your personal information.
We'll inform you if a new need arises, unless we're authorized by law to disclose your information without your consent. In all cases, we ensure the protection and confidentiality of the personal information we disclose.
Protecting the security and confidentiality of your information
Is my personal information secure?
We apply the necessary security measures rigorously to ensure the protection of your personal information.
These measures may consist of:
Technology security measures
Password
Data encryption
Access management system
Monitoring and control to detect suspicious activity
Any other security measures required to limit access
Administrative security measures
Access to your information limited to our employees, consultants, agents and representatives who need it to perform their duties
Adherence to the Code of Professional Conduct and annual certification required for all our employees and consultants, with strict rules governing the protection of personal information
Regular training and education of employees and consultants on the Code of Professional Conduct, policies, practices and procedures on security and privacy
Policies and procedures for monitoring, investigating and updating security systems and measures
Ongoing monitoring and control to detect suspicious activity and potential deviations from our directives and policies
Where is my personal information stored?
Your information is usually stored in Canada, but we may use suppliers or partners in other countries. If required by law or court order, those countries' legal authorities may have access to it, including law enforcement and national 
security agencies.
If we need to disclose personal information to our suppliers and partners, we will ensure the protection and confidentiality of this personal information meets our own requirements and will ask these suppliers and partners to 
contractually agree to comply with and respect these requirements.
In all cases, we'll ensure the protection and confidentiality of your information.
How is my personal information stored?
We store your personal information in a secure and confidential manner for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and meet our legal obligations.
For example, in Canada, we're subject to laws and regulations that stipulate minimum retention periods. The retention periods must take into account the exhaustion of potential remedies and limitation periods applicable in Canada. 
These retention periods vary depending on the situation. Therefore, we may retain your personal information after your relationship with us has ended.
When and how is personal information disposed of?
Once the retention period has expired, we ensure that your personal information is safely disposed of or de-identified. While deletion is a final and irreversible disposal process, de-identification means that your personal information 
is altered so that it can no longer directly or indirectly identify you.
Deletion and de-identification are carried out in a secure manner, in accordance with applicable best practices.
Respecting your rights when it comes to your information
Can I access, correct or update my personal information?
Yes, you can access your personal information at any time.
To do so, you must submit a written request to us. Your request must be detailed enough to allow us to identify the documents or other media containing the personal information you wish to access.
We may need to validate your identity and the reason for your request.
We'll inform you if there are any fees for processing your request. These fees, if any, are reasonable and are usually limited to the cost of transcription, reproduction or transmission. In such cases, we'll ask for your permission 
before proceeding.
Yes, you can correct inaccurate and incomplete personal information we have about you.
If you wish to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we have about you, you can make the changes in the application. You can also contact us.
Some personal information cannot be changed directly in the application. For example, for a change of address, you're responsible for contacting us to update your personal information.
What can I do if I have questions or if I'm not satisfied with the handling of my personal information?
If you have a question, concern or complaint about the processing of your personal information, you can:
First,

Part 2 – Alert Program Terms and Conditions
Last update:
April 17, 2024
1. Introduction
You must agree to these Terms and Conditions to participate in the Alert program. Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you do not want to agree to these Terms and Conditions, you should not participate in the Alert program or 
activate it in the application. See Section 2.5 for eligibility requirements for the Alert program.
You can stop participating in the Alert program at any time, subject to certain conditions. See Section 2.14 for more information.
These Terms and Conditions do not change Roost's terms and conditions or those of the App Store or Google Play as applicable.
2. Program description
2.1 Participating in the Alert program
To participate in the Alert program, you must buy the security system from Roost, download the application if you haven't done so already, and agree to the Privacy Policy and these Terms and Conditions of the Alert program.
2.2 Scope of the Alert program
The Alert program is a prevention program offered by Roost in collaboration with us. It allows you to:
Arm and disarm your security system using your smartphone or the keypad included in your security system; and
Receive notifications in the application or by text message, according to your communication preferences, in the event of smoke, a break-in, a water leak, freezing temperatures or a power outage.
With a subscription to Roost's professional monitoring service, you will also receive:
Text messages on your smartphone, automated calls or, if needed, a call from the monitoring service contracted by Roost in the event of a smoke or intrusion alert to see whether it's necessary to dispatch emergency services to your 
home.
The devices included in the security system do not prevent incidents such as water leaks, frozen pipes, or break-ins from occurring. You can prevent or limit the damage caused by such incidents by taking action when you receive an 
alert on your smartphone about any event detected by the security system. Please also note that receiving an alert does not mean an insurance claim has been started, and the fact that you received an alert has no impact on any insurance claim you may 
file.
If your security system is not installed properly, the functions that the application offers may not work. It is your responsibility to follow the instructions provided and make sure the security system devices are installed correctly. 
You must test and maintain your devices, replacing batteries as necessary.
2.3 Services offered by Roost
The security system and the professional monitoring service are offered by Roost. Information about the status of your subscription to the professional monitoring service and about events detected by the security system are displayed 
in the application, using data provided by Roost.
2.4 Specific information about the smoke alarm listener
The security system does not include a smoke detector.
[ 2 ]
note
The smoke alarm listener included in your security system does not replace the smoke detector in your home and does not detect 
smoke. It only detects alarm sounds emitted by your smoke detector.
Warning: Some older models of smoke detectors are not compatible with the security system.
2.5 Eligibility requirements for participating in the Alert program
Reside in Canada in one of the participating provinces or territories: Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Nunavut or Northwest Territories.
Have a Wi-Fi network connected to a high-speed internet service in the home where the security system is installed.
Have a smartphone (e.g., iPhone or Android) with wireless service.
Buy Roost's home security system.
Install the application on your smartphone and install the security system in your home.
Authorize the collection, use and sharing of your personal information in accordance with applicable regulations and the Alert Program Privacy Policy presented in Part 1 of this document.
2.6 Basic requirements for security system functioning
In order for the security system to work properly, you must:
Ensure the smart base is connected to your home's Wi-Fi network.
[ 3 ]
note
Maintain the power supply to the smart base.
Ensure your devices are paired with the smart base.
Ensure the batteries in each device are charged.
Install all the devices as instructed in the application.
If you make changes to your home's Wi-Fi settings or switch internet providers, you are responsible for updating the Wi-Fi settings for the smart base in the application to make sure the security system continues working properly.
To continue participating in the Alert program, you agree to:
Download all updates available for the application
Not delete or deactivate the application on your smartphone
Not permanently uninstall the security system from the application
2.7 Updating personal information in the application
If you move or if your personal information changes, you are responsible for contacting us to make sure the right address is on file for your security system. You are also responsible for updating your cellphone number in the 
application if you change it. Since your contact information is shared with the central station in case of an emergency (if you have a professional monitoring service subscription), it's important to keep it up to date.
It is also your responsibility to maintain up-to-date information for your emergency contacts in the application.
2.8 Moving to another country, province or territory
The Alert program is available in Canada only. It is
not available
outside Canada or in the following provinces and territories: Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon. If you 
move to one of these provinces or territories or to another country, you can no longer participate in the Alert program.
2.9 Potential discounts on home insurance premiums
The Alert program is not a property and casualty insurance product. However, by participating in the Alert program, you might be eligible for a discount on your home insurance premiums.
The discount is automatically applied to qualifying insurance policies in this application if you meet the following conditions:
You are the primary insured on a home insurance policy that's eligible for discounts from the insurer.
You synced your home insurance policy in this application.
For the discounts for having a centrally monitored security system:
You have the required number of devices and they are connected to the smart base and visible in the app.
You tested that your smoke alarm listener detects your smoke detector using the instructions provided in the application.
For the discount for having a centrally monitored water leak detector system:
You installed at least 5 water and freeze detectors and you've kept them installed in the application and connected to the security system's smart base.
You have an ongoing subscription to Roost's professional monitoring service.
If you do not meet these conditions, please contact us to check whether you're eligible for discounts.
Any discounts you receive will automatically be terminated if you no longer meet one of the conditions mentioned above or if you stop participating in the Alert program. Your discount will expire a minimum of 30 days after you stop 
participating in the Alert program or no longer meet the conditions for the discount.
We reserve the right to change the conditions, activation process and automatic deactivation process for these discounts at any time.
2.10 Smartphone usage
Warning
: The Alert program uses a certain amount of power from your smartphone's battery in order to run in the application. In order for your application to be able to send you alerts about events detected by your 
security system, you must:
Keep your smartphone powered on
Make sure your smartphone's battery is charged
Make sure your security system's devices are installed and working in the application
The types of alerts you receive depend on your communication preferences in the application. You can choose to enable push notifications and/or text messages.
Warning
: The Alert program in your application receives data collected by your security system through a Wi-Fi connection or cellular network. If your smartphone is not connected to Wi-Fi, the Alert program might use 
data from your cellphone plan. You are responsible for paying any data usage fees that may apply.
2.11 Managing your security system from another smartphone
The Alert program can only be used on one smartphone to manage the security system and it can only be associated with one mobile number.
If you want to manage your security system from another smartphone, you must uninstall your security system from the application and reinstall it in the application downloaded onto the other smartphone.
Please note that you cannot manage multiple security systems from the same smartphone because each security system must be associated with its own mobile phone number. If you want to use more than one security system, each additional 
security system must be connected to a unique mobile phone number.
2.12 Installing your security system in another home
All devices from the same security system must be installed at the same address.
To install your security system at another address, you'll first need to uninstall all the devices of your security system from your home. Do not uninstall them from your application. Next, reinstall them at your new address, following 
the best practices for installation described in the application and the Installation and User Guide. If you change the address of the security system, contact us and let us know.
2.13 Changes to the Alert program or the Terms and Conditions
We reserve the right to change the Alert program and the Terms and Conditions at any time. By continuing to participate in the Alert program, you are agreeing to any potential changes. We recommend reviewing these Terms and Conditions 
on a regular basis.
Please check the date at the top of the Terms and Conditions to see when they were last updated.
2.14 Terminating your participation in the Alert program
To end your participation in the Alert program, uninstall your security system from your home and from the application. If you have a subscription to the professional monitoring service, you must cancel it through Roost's online store.
As soon as you stop participating in the Alert program, you will no longer receive alerts related to the security system on your smartphone, and you will no longer have access to the services offered through the Alert program.
We may terminate your participation in the Alert program if you no longer meet one of the eligibility criteria in section 2.5.
2.15 Termination of the Alert program
We reserve the right to terminate the program at any time.

Subject to your compliance with the Terms and Conditions, we grant you a revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable limited licence to use the Alert program in the application on any smartphone in your possession or under your
