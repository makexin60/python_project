We obtain your personal information from the following sources:

Automated technologies, such as cookies, server logs and other similar technologies;

Providers of social media platforms (such as Meta who provide Facebook and Instagram, X, Google who provide YouTube as well as TikTok and Snapchat) where you share our content, tweet, like, follow us or our posts through social media; and
Otherwise as explained below in this What Personal Information do we collect and how do we use it? section.
Our primary goal in collecting personal information about you is to: (i) provide our Services to you and carry out requests made by you on the Sites or in our cinemas or otherwise; (ii) verify your identity and age; (iii) help us improve our products and services and develop and market new products and services; (iv) investigate or settle inquiries or disputes; (v) comply with any applicable law, court order, other judicial process, or the requirements of a regulator; (vi) enforce our agreements with you; (vii) protect the rights, property or safety of us or third parties, including our other customers and users of the Sites and at our cinemas; (viii) provide support for the provision of our Services; and (ix) use as otherwise required or permitted by law.
In particular, we use your personal information for the following purposes:
Back to top
4.1 Fulfilment of products and services
4.1 Fulfilment of products and services
We collect and maintain personal information that is voluntarily submitted to us during the use of the Sites and/or our Services. We use the contact and payment details which are provided to us so that we can fulfil the supply of products and services which have been ordered from our Sites or in our cinemas. We will use contact information to send you service related communications relating to these orders. This includes your purchase of products and services, your registration for an account with us, your attendance at events hosted by us or our third party partners, your hire of our cinemas for your own events and the processing of returns and refunds. For example:
Ticket bookings, gifts and other online purchases.
If you wish to book tickets through our Sites we will need to know your name, and your email address. We may also need this information when you make any other purchases via our Sites, such as ordering 3D glasses. If you request a booking confirmation to be sent by SMS, we will also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
If you request one of our reduced price or free tickets (such as a student ticket, senior ticket, or CEA Carer (or equivalent) ticket) we may ask to see an appropriate form of identification to confirm your eligibility to purchase the reduced price ticket. In some cases, we may need to verify the validity of your ID against third party databases (for example where you are using a CEA Carer Card), but we will not take or keep a copy of your ID on any of our systems.
If you wish to purchase a gift from the Gifts section of our Sites we will need to know your name, and email address. We will also need to know the name of the recipient and the delivery address for gifts sent by post or the name and email address of the recipient where gifts are sent by email.
Events
If you wish to make a private hire booking for an event with us through the Cineworld online events booking portal on our website you will need to register for an Events account (see 4.3 Providing and Administering Online Accounts) and provide details of your selections for your booking such as cinema, date, time, movie and any snacks choices. You will also need to provide your name, email address, contact address, phone number and organisation type together with your details of your booking choices when you book an Event directly with our Venue Hire Team by email or phone.
We use this personal information to process and fulfil your orders and to send you service related emails (and where requested, text messages) for your booking or purchase. We may also use these details to send you a follow-up service email after your cinema visit or event, to check that you were satisfied with our service.
If you choose to pay for your purchases on our websites:
by credit, debit or charge card those payments will be processed by our payment provider, PayPal (t/a Braintree), rather than by us. When processing your payments on our behalf, PayPal acts as an independent data controller of your personal information and its own privacy statement, available at
https://www.braintreepayments.com/gb/legal/braintree-privacy-policy
, will apply.
by Cineworld gift card, e-gift code or other promotional code to pay for your purchases those payments may be processed by our gifts and promotions service providers, rather than by us.
using your PayPal account or, where available, your Google Pay or Apple Pay account you will be transferred to the payment provider’s platform and the payment information and processing activities will be subject to the payment provider’s privacy notice as they will be the controller of your personal information, not Cineworld. The PayPal privacy notice is available at
www.paypal.com/myaccount/privacy/privacyhub
.
When you pay for your Event and venue hire bookings by direct arrangement with our Venue Hire team, your payment will also be processed on our behalf by our payment provider, PayPal (T/a Braintree), rather than by us.
We may receive part of the payment details such as your name, email address and some of the digits of your payment card number from our payment processor. These will be used to help connect your payment with your booking on our Site and may also be used by us if we provide you with a refund.
What is our legal basis?
It is necessary for us to use your personal information to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you such as your contract with us for your ticket or gift purchase. It is in our legitimate interest to use personal information of a gift recipient in order to provide them with the gifts purchased for them. It is also in our legitimate interest to check your ID to verify that you qualify for any reduced price or free ticket.
Where we process information concerning your health for the above purposes, we rely on your explicit consent because we are processing this information to provide a service that you have voluntarily requested.

4.2 Verify the age of persons using our products and services
We welcome children and young people to our cinemas although our Sites are not intended to be used by children aged under 16. In particular, some of our Services and features available on our Sites (including online ticket booking, online Events bookings, Unlimited memberships and My Cineworld accounts) have age restrictions attached to their use. These age restrictions are explained in the terms and conditions relating to our Services, which are located
here
.
This means that we may need to ask you to provide your date of birth and, where some of our products or services are being purchased as a gift, the date of birth of the recipient of the gift.
We may also use your date of birth to understand more about our customers (see the
Customer Insight and Analysis section
for more details about our use of your personal information for this purpose).
What is our legal basis?
Where we use your personal information to verify you or the person receiving our Services meets any age restrictions which we have set, it is in our legitimate interests to do so. Where we use your date of birth to prevent you from accessing age restricted films or purchasing alcohol, we do so because this is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations. When you use our Services, it is also necessary for us to process your personal information for the purpose of performing our contract with you.

Please see the ‘Providing and administering My Cineworld accounts’ section for further details. You can use your My Cineworld account to access your digital Unlimited card, book tickets and manage your Unlimited membership online.

You will also need to provide us with a photo of yourself which will be displayed on the digital Unlimited card and, if you have been issued with a plastic Unlimited Card, printed on the physical Unlimited Card and used to verify your identity at the cinema, to prevent misuse and for fraud prevention purposes. Unless you pay your subscription fees by Direct Debit, throughout your Unlimited membership, you’ll need to provide details of a valid payment card to be linked with your Unlimited membership to pay the Unlimited membership fees, these details will be stored in your My Cineworld account and you can update them at any time in your account. We’ll still need these payment card details, even if you choose to pay for your initial Membership Fees using a gift card/e-gift voucher/promotional code or American Express card.
If you applied for your Unlimited membership before 2nd October 2024, we asked you to provide your postal address (and, if you were buying Unlimited membership as a gift for someone else, their postal address) so that we knew where to send the plastic Unlimited Card and how to get in touch if we needed to contact you (or the gift recipient) about the Unlimited membership account.
Where you use your Unlimited card to obtain discounts or benefits from our third party partners, we may receive personal information about your use of your Unlimited card from these third party partners. Our third party partners are identified on our Sites
here
. Please see the
Customer Insight and Analysis section
for more details about how we use the personal information that we receive from our third party partners.

Where you submit personal information about that person to us, you confirm that you have all necessary permissions and consents to do so (including the consent of the Unlimited member’s parent or guardian, if they are under 16). We will also let the Unlimited member know that you have bought them Unlimited membership as a gift and provided us with personal information about them.
As a part of your Unlimited membership, we will use your contact details to send you service communications, including information about your membership such as renewal reminders, account information and membership summaries and sometimes freebies, details of new cinema openings or changes or additions to our selection of Unlimited partners, the latest films as well as hints and tips on how to make the most of your membership (for example a series of messages about how and where to use your Unlimited Card when you first join Unlimited). You can find out more about what’s included with the Unlimited membership service in our Common Questions section
here
. In addition, where we have a lawful right to send you marketing communications, we will also send you marketing relating to your Unlimited membership. Please see the

8.Transfers of your personal information overseas
8.1 Internally within our group
We transfer your personal information within our group as described in
section 7
.
Some of our group companies that are based outside of the UK and EEA, such as Regal Entertainment Group (a company based in the US), provide various hosting and support services to Cineworld Cinemas, so your personal information may be transferred from the UK/EEA to the US or other non-UK/EEA jurisdictions. Where this happens, we have procedures in place to ensure your personal information receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the UK or EEA and use UK ICO and European Commission approved ‘model clauses’ as the lawful basis for transferring personal information outside of the UK and EEA. A copy of these Model clauses can be provided to you on request.
8.2 To external third parties
Some of the third parties that we describe in section 7 may be located outside of the UK and EEA or may otherwise transfer your personal information outside of the UK or EEA. Where we transfer your personal information to external third parties, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.
In respect of transfers of your personal information outside of the UK/EEA, this means that we will ensure that there is a lawful basis for transferring personal information outside the UK/EEA. Our standard practice is to use ‘model clauses’ which have been approved by the UK ICO and European Commission for such transfers. We may also rely on other mechanisms where appropriate, including reliance on a third party’s ‘binding corporate rules’.

9. Third party links and services
Our Sites contain links to third party websites and services, including those of our third party partners. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website or you request a service from a third party, this Privacy Policy no longer applies.
Your browsing and interaction on any other websites, or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website’s or third party service provider’s own rules and policies.
We do not monitor, control, or endorse the privacy practices of any third parties.
We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to personal information collected by us through our Sites and Services and does not apply to these third party websites and third party service providers.
Back to top
10. How long do we keep your personal information for?
Whenever we collect or process your personal information we will usually keep it for 13 months after our last interaction with you or otherwise in accordance with our data retention policy, pursuant to which we do not retain personal information for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is collected. We may keep personal information you give us in relation to any contract that we have with you for seven years to ensure that we can exercise rights in relation to any legal claims relating to that contract.
If your information is only useful for a short period e.g. for specific marketing campaigns, we may delete it after a shorter period. We usually keep CCTV footage for up to 60 days although we may retain it for a longer period where needed to support investigations of accidents or incidents, insurance claims and related legal, law enforcement or regulatory action.
At the end of the relevant retention period, your data will either be deleted or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning. We keep the length of time that we hold your personal information for under review.
Back to top
11. Confidentiality and security of your personal information
We are committed to keeping the personal information you provide to us secure and we will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration.
We have implemented information security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal information that we have under our control from:
unauthorised access;
improper use or disclosure;
unauthorised modification; and
unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
All of our employees and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal information on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personal information of all users of our Services.
Back to top
12. How to access your information and your other rights
You have the following rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details set out in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy or using any other method described below:
Your right of access.
If you ask us, we’ll confirm whether we’re processing your personal information and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personal information (along with certain other details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
Your right to rectification.
If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you’re entitled to have it rectified. If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
If you have a My Cineworld account, you can log in and amend your contact details and marketing preferences whenever you like.
Your right to erasure.
You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances such as where we no longer need it or if you withdraw your consent (where applicable). If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
Your right to restrict processing.
You can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal information or you object to us processing it. It won’t stop us from storing your personal information though. We’ll tell you before we lift any restriction. If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the restriction where it is possible for us to do so. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
Your right to data portability.
You have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal information you’ve provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.
Your right to object.
You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:
relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal information, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or
processing your personal information for direct marketing.
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing communications sent to you by email or text at any time by using the ‘opt-out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ link that we will present to you in the marketing communication. You can stop push notifications by adjusting the settings in our app on your mobile device. You can ask us to stop sharing your email address in a pseudonymised form with social media platforms by contacting us using the details provided above (see How to contact us). Please note that it may take us a few days (but usually no longer than 14 days) to ensure our marketing systems are updated and during this period you may still receive marketing communications from us.
Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it’s based solely on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you, unless such decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us.
Your right to withdraw consent.
If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we’ve handled your personal information, you can report it to the relevant Supervisory Authority which, in relation to provision of our Sites and Services in:
the UK, the supervisory authority is the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can find details about how to do this on the ICO website at
https://ico.org.uk/concerns/
or by calling their helpline on 0303 123 1113, and
the Republic of Ireland, the supervisory authority is the Data Protection Commission (DPC). You can find details about how to do this on the DPC website at
https://dataprotection.ie/docs/Making-a-Complaint-to-the-Data-Protection-Commissioner/r/18.htm
or emailing them at info@dataprotection.ie.
To exercise any of your rights in relation to personal information you have shared with Braintree/PayPal when making payments on our Sites during the payment process (see
section 4.1
above), you will need to contact Braintee/PayPal directly. More information is available in their Privacy Notices which can be found at

13. Changes to this privacy policy
To ensure that you are always aware of how we use your personal information we will update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes to our use of your personal information. We may also make changes as required to comply with changes in applicable law or regulatory requirements. We will post any changes on our Sites to keep you aware and if you are an Unlimited member or have a My Cineworld or Events account we will notify you by e-mail of any significant changes.

Cookie policy
Last updated February 2025
This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) is intended to inform you how we use “cookies” and similar technologies on our websites at
www.cineworld.co.uk
,
www.cineworld.ie
,
www.cineworld.com
and www.events.cineworld.co.uk and in our mobile applications (“
Sites
”) and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Sites. Please take a moment to read and understand this Cookie Policy. This Cookie Policy should also be read in conjunction with our
Privacy Policy
and our
Online Terms of Use
(which contain our Website Terms of Use).
If you access our Sites from the UK or the Channel Islands, ‘we’ means Cineworld Cinemas Limited, if you access our Sites from the Republic of Ireland ‘we’ means Adelphi-Carlton Limited. We are part of the same group and trade under the Cineworld brand to operate Cineworld Cinemas and the Sites.  Please see our Privacy Policy to find out more about us.
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies and similar technologies are very small text documents or pieces of code, which often include an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website or use a mobile application, a computer asks your computer or mobile device for permission to store this file on your computer or mobile device and access information from it. Information gathered through cookies and similar technologies may include the date and time of visits and how you are using the particular website or mobile application. Cookies are used by us as part of our Sites and they are also used by some of our third party partners.
For more details on cookies and similar technologies please visit
All About Cookies
. For the purposes of the remaining sections of this Cookie Policy we will refer to all technologies using the above features as “cookies”.
CONSENT TO OUR USE OF COOKIES
By using any of the Sites you acknowledge that we may store and access essential cookies on your computer or other device. Necessary cookies are cookies which are essential for the operation of our Sites.
Further, where you give permission, we may also store and access certain non-essential cookies on your computer or other device. These cookies are not essential to the operation of our Sites but allow us to provide additional functionality or to gather additional information about your use of our Sites. You are not obliged to give consent to our use of non-essential cookies and we will not place such cookies until you have given your consent.
If you wish to block or delete cookies, or you would like to withdraw consent to our use of non-essential cookies, you can find out how to do so below and manage your cookies preferences
here
.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH COOKIES?
Necessary Cookies
We use cookies where they are essential for the operation of the Sites, for example to remember that you are signed in to the Sites and to uniquely identify your browsing session on our Sites, which allows us to coordinate this information with data from our Sites server. Without these cookies, services that you have asked for, like booking tickets, cannot be provided.
Analytics Cookies
We use “analytics” cookies. These, along with other information, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people using the Sites and which features of our Sites are most popular, whether you have visited before and the website that you visited prior to visiting our Sites. We use this information to improve the Sites. We do not generally store any information that you provide to us in an analytics cookie.
Display Adverts
We use these cookies to deliver adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement on our Sites and help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited our Sites and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers so that they can make their advertising more relevant to you when you visit their websites (including social media sites).
Social Media Cookies
We use cookies to personalise your interaction with social media, such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Google.  Such cookies recognise users of those social media sites when you view social media content on our Sites.  They also allow you to quickly share content across social media, through the use of simple ‘sharing’ buttons.
Our Sites may also contain features that enable you to use your Facebook, Google and X accounts to sign in and create/maintain an account with us and to enable us to store your content. This involves the use of cookies.
Targeting Cookies
We use targeting cookies to help us deliver our adverts including film adverts when you visit other websites, such as news websites. This is known as ‘retargeting’. This technique helps to ensure that the ads you receive are more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies help to measure the effectiveness of an ad (for example, by reporting whether you have clicked on it) and can also limit the number of times that you see an ad (for example, if you see it twice but don’t click on it, you may not see it again). These cookies are usually placed by advertising networks that we and other advertisers work with to deliver ads. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other ad networks to show you relevant ads.
We may use a third party partner Rokt to provide custom offers from other brands on our Sites. You can learn more about Rokt and learn how to opt-out of Rokt’s personalized brand offers by visiting
www.rokt.com/privacy-policy
or following the links within the ads displayed.
MORE INFORMATION
You can find more information about the individual cookies used in the Sites and the purposes for which they are used, within our cookies management tool
here.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REFUSE, BLOCK OR DELETE COOKIES?
In order to use some parts of our Sites you will need to accept cookies. If you choose to withhold consent to our use of cookies, or you subsequently block or delete cookies, some aspects of our Sites may not work properly and you may not be able to access all or part of our Sites.
HOW TO MANAGE OR BLOCK COOKIES

You can also block the use of cookies altogether by activating the relevant settings in your browser. For more information on cookie management and blocking or deleting cookies for a wide variety of browsers, visit

Privacy Policy
”) explains how Rokt® entities (“

”), collect and use Personal Information (defined below) and sets out the basis on which Personal Information we collect from or about you will be processed by us. This document aims to provide concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible information about how we process personal data – please read it.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Rokt experiences provided via rokt.com and other related Rokt websites (“
Rokt Owned Sites
”), and Rokt technology that is integrated on third-party partner websites, app or mobile-device applications (“

If you are a Rokt employee or contractor, or if you apply for a job with Rokt, your Personal Information collected in the employment or job applicant contexts will be subject to separate privacy policies that we provide to you where and when appropriate.
This Privacy Policy replaces and supersedes the last version of this Privacy Policy for all users. It should be read in conjunction with the

What does Rokt do?
Rokt provides services to ecommerce companies (“
Partners
”) that allow you to receive offers, promotions, coupons, discounts, app download invitations, and calendar subscription invitations, and to interact with other marketing services (including during or after a transaction) (collectively, “
Offers
”) from third-party advertisers (“
Advertisers
”), displayed on Rokt Sites. You may choose to sign up to receive communications in respect of such Offers, including by email, phone or SMS, from Advertisers or Partners, and from Rokt. Rokt also provides the “AfterSell Powered by Rokt” and “Upcart Powered by Rokt” Shopify applications operated by Beam Commerce Inc., a subsidiary of Rokt.
What are the consequences of opting into Rokt’s Offers?
There is no obligation for you to sign up to Offers, at all. If you sign up to any Offers, we may share your Personal Information, where applicable, with the party identified in the Offer, so that any Offers they have offered may be fulfilled by them, and so they may provide further information associated with such Offers, as further detailed below under ‘Use and Disclosure of your Personal Information’. Importantly, there are no negative consequences if you do not sign up to an Offer, nor are you prevented from accessing the services in future from that company – simply no further action will be taken in respect of that Offer.
Our commitment to privacy
Rokt takes your privacy very seriously and is committed to protecting it, as well as securing the data entrusted to us by Partners, Advertisers and you. We understand that you will only use our service if you can trust us to protect your Personal Information and use it appropriately. For more information on the steps we take to secure your data, see ‘Information security safeguards’ below.
What is Personal Information?
“
Personal Information
” or “
Personal Data
” is information about you which (i) can be used to identify, contact or locate you; (ii) can be combined with other information that is linked to you; or (iii) is defined as “Personal Data” or “Personal Information” by applicable laws or regulations relating to the collection, use, storage or disclosure of information about you. Personal Information includes contact information (e.g. email address, telephone number), online information (e.g. IP addresses, device identifiers), and other data which can be used individually or in combination with other data to identify an individual (such as gender, marital status, age, or postcode).
Types of Personal Information that we collect, when, why and from whom (our basis for processing)
We collect and process a number of categories of Personal Information, on the basis of the legitimate interests of Rokt and its Partners and Advertisers:
Personal Information you give us when you engage with us or sign up to Offers across Rokt Sites (such as your name and email address);
Personal Information you provide to us through our various customer contact channels (such as your name, email address, phone number, and/or any other personal details you choose to provide when you contact us);
Personal Information about you provided to us by Advertisers and Partners (as part of our services to them), such as your identifying details (such as email address, gender, age/DOB, postcode, title, phone number), transaction details or conversion data (such as what you purchased, when and via what method);
Usage data about your interactions with the Rokt Sites and/or Offers or any communications sent on behalf of Rokt, Advertisers or Partners, including:
information relating to your Offer interaction, such as Offer click-through rates and viewing data;
device information and website analytics information retrieved from your device/web browser, such as your device profile, IP address, browser type/version, language preferences, access times, referring website address, or your general geographic area based on your IP address;
Information we automatically obtain using cookies, eTags/cache browsers, pixels, web beacons/GIFs, local storage, or other identifiers or other tracking technologies on Rokt Sites and in e-mails we send you, that tell us the pages you view, the links you click, whether an email has been opened, transaction information and other actions relating to our services and technology;
If you engage with Rokt on behalf of your business or employer in furtherance of commercial dealings with us, we will collect Personal Information in the course of managing the relationship, such as your business contact information and our contact history, as well as your login credentials to access your Rokt account.
Personal Information about you that we may obtain from third-party sources and platforms (including data validation services, authentication service providers (including for calendaring services), data enrichment providers, social networking sites, online marketing and segmentation providers and ad-targeting companies) to supplement the information we collect from Partners and Advertisers and directly from you. For example, when you sign up to an Offer using your email address, we verify with a validation service that the email address is real, in order to ensure valid registration information and prevent fraudulent signups. In other cases, we may use age verification providers in order to ensure that Offers are appropriate for a particular individual above or below the age of majority, or the age of digital consent.
In some circumstances where we process your Personal Information on the basis of our legitimate interests and those of our Partners and Advertisers, separate consent may be required by law for us to operate our technology (for example, in the case of cookies or other tracking technology that we use to access end user devices or technology that identifies your general location or geographic position). Your consent may be obtained by us or on our behalf by our Partners and Advertisers.
The legitimate business interests referred to above, which have been balanced against the rights and freedoms of data subjects and their reasonable expectations, include:
(i) the provision and use of website preference management software and analytics services ensuring customers have the best possible website experience by ensuring that content is relevant, engaging and personalized for each user viewing content on Rokt Sites (e.g. “if you just bought this product, you might like…”) or accords with the Partner’s specified user journey or journey parameters;
(ii) the provision and use of website brand management tools to promote brand safety for website users and owners;
(iii) ensuring website safety by ensuring Offers presented to users are age-appropriate and shown only to their intended audience (e.g. not to children);
(iv) the provision and use of website analytics and conversion tracking tools to assess the transaction attributes to optimize future marketing campaigns and future marketing strategy;
(v) the provision of customer and email management software services allowing customers to effectively subscribe or unsubscribe to Offers that may be of interest or value to them;
(vi) allowing website owners to recoup the actual cost of providing website services to users;
(vii) validating users to verify the accuracy of customer data and to reduce fraudulent signups;
(viii) creating and retaining evidential records to validate the provision of consent to direct marketing;
(ix) using limited data sets for suppression purposes to prevent further unwanted processing for users who have either (a) objected to direct marketing or (b) have exercised their right to erasure (in respect of Personal Information provided by them), if applicable; and
(x) managing our customer relationships with Partners and Advertisers, and overseeing our vendors, service providers, and data processors to ensure compliance with contractual and legal obligations.
Note that, depending on local data protection laws where you are located, you may have a right to object to processing on the above basis – see below under ‘Your rights in relation to your Personal Information’.
Note in order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Rokt, information collected through one Rokt service may also be combined with information obtained through other Rokt services.

Rokt’s technology allows us to display Offers from Partners and Advertisers on Rokt Sites, and allows you to sign up to receive communications with respect to such Offers.

Other Offer types
Information consistent with the nature of the Offer being provided, similar in nature to the details set out above
Electronic Communications
– Where a Partner or Advertiser has made an Offer, and you indicate that you wish to accept it (including by swiping and clicking), we disclose your Personal Information to the Partner or Advertiser  (as applicable) so that any Offers they have offered may be fulfilled by them, and so they may provide you with further information associated with such Offers to you via the applicable or appropriate medium (including email, SMS, or communicating with you at the telephone number provided or confirmed (which may include using an automatic telephone dialing system or pre-recorded message)). That information is provided to such party for the purpose of fulfilling the Offer, or other purpose explicitly disclosed at the time of collection, and your information will be handled by that party in accordance with its own privacy policy.
(iii) Further disclosure of your Personal Information
We may additionally disclose your Personal Information as follows:
to third-party agents and processors, such as our technology vendors, CRM and data management platforms, data transmission companies, email service providers, data validation service providers, authentication service providers, data enrichment providers, online marketing and segmentation providers; and ad-targeting companies, as applicable, predominantly located in the USA, for third-party processing;
to Advertisers or Partners if you have entered a contest or promotion sponsored by Rokt via their site;
to any member of the Rokt Group, meaning subsidiaries of parent company Rokt Inc., and their respective professional advisors, directors, employees, contractors and personnel;
as required by any law, subpoena, court order, or other enforceable legal process (including laws outside your country of residence);
as necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
as necessary for us to do in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
as part of or in anticipation of a business sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of substantial corporate assets, reorganization, liquidation, or similar business transaction or corporate event;
and for such other purposes that are consistent with the way we have informed you that we will use your Personal Information in this Privacy Policy or at the time we collect your Personal Information; and subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Disclosure of your Personal Information to recipients ‘overseas’
Rokt processes Personal Information in multiple countries, on high-security servers, possibly located outside the country where you live, with our primary servers located in the USA. Before we disclose your Personal Information to an overseas recipient, we take steps as are necessary and reasonable in the circumstances to help ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach privacy laws in relation to your Personal Information.
Where we disclose your Personal Information to Advertisers and other third-party processors, it is likely (although not assured) the Advertisers or third-party processor will be located in one of the markets in which we operate or have a presence – namely the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Japan, the EU, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and any other countries in which we operate as disclosed at
https://rokt.com/about-us
and
https://rokt.com/rokt-subprocessors
.
Rokt discloses Personal Information of individuals located in the European Economic Area with: (i) suppliers; (ii) other members of the Rokt Group; and (iii) Rokt’s Advertisers and Partners located outside of the European Economic Area. Such transfers may be made: (a) to a third country or territory that is assessed by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection; (b) to recipients who have in place appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses that are approved by the European Commission or binding corporate rules that have been approved by a competent supervisory authority; or (c) where a transfer to a third country is occasional and necessary in relation to a contract between us or in your interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. In order to safeguard transfers of personal data for EU residents outside of the EU, Rokt discloses information concerning EU residents both (i) with suppliers and (ii) within the Rokt Group, on the basis of EU-approved standard contractual clauses approved under Art 47 GDPR.
Information security safeguards
The security of your Personal Information is a priority for us, especially when your personal information is transferred ‘overseas’.
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures (including physical and electronic security) designed to safeguard Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information. However, no method of online transmission or storage of information is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will always be safe no matter what measures we put in place. Specific measures that we use include:
restricting access to Personal Information where practicable;
using industry-standard encryption to help protect data in transit and at rest;
building and maintaining a secure (private) network with no direct access between the internet and systems processing your data;
using pseudonymization techniques such as hashing email addresses or device IDs that we associate with you to reduce the risks when processing that data;
conducting regular scans and penetration tests of our applications and networks to identify (and address) any potential vulnerabilities;
demanding equivalent security and confidentiality measures from any third parties we do business with.
Data retention
Rokt sets data retention periods in consultation with its Partners and Advertisers in determining how long to retain the Personal Information about you supplied to us by them, subject to you exercising your lawful data subject rights, and further subject to any requirement for us to hold data for such period as may be required to establish, exercise or defend legal rights or ongoing legitimate business interests (e.g. to prove that you signed up to a particular Offer or electronic communication). These periods vary by market in accordance with local laws. Please refer to the ‘Your rights in relation to your Personal Information’ section below for more information about how you can exercise your rights.
In respect of other categories of Personal Information and Personal Information collected on Rokt Owned Sites, if Rokt has no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will take all reasonable steps to destroy the information and/or ensure that the information is de-identified or anonymized or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
We rely on the following criteria to help determine the appropriate retention periods: (i) the necessity of the Personal Information to provide our services to Partners and Advertisers; (ii) the types and sensitivity of Personal Information being processed; (iii) regulatory requirements that we are subject to, including laws and regulations related to tax, employment, accounting, and securities; and (iv) whether a legal claim might be brought against us, for which the Personal Information would be relevant.
Rokt is not responsible for how long Partners and Advertisers may retain your Personal Information. You should consult the privacy notices provided by Partners and Advertisers with whom you interact in order to determine how long they may retain your Personal Information.
How we use Tracking Technologies
Like many companies, when we display online Offers to you, we may use one or more persistent “
Tracking Technologies
” (such as cookies, entity tags (eTags), pixels, web beacons/ GIFs, local storage, or other identifiers on your device and browser settings) in order to recognize you and your device each time we display Offers to you. We also apply statistical probabilities to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user). Tracking Technologies may set or alter settings or configurations on your device. We use both session and persistent Tracking Technologies.
We use these technologies for a number of purposes to enhance your online experience, such as for preference setting, Offer selection, analytics, conversion attribution and fraud reduction. By rejecting Tracking Technologies, this does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit Rokt Sites.
Further information on our use of Tracking Technologies, and how you can exercise your rights not to accept the use of Tracking Technologies, is set out in our ‘Cookies’ Policy.
What this Privacy Policy does not cover
Where Rokt provides information to a third-party (such as an Advertiser or Partner, for example, in relation to an Offer), you acknowledge that your Personal Information will be handled by that third party in accordance with its own privacy policy and not in accordance with the Rokt Privacy Policy. You should consult our Advertiser’s and Partner’s own privacy policies for further details on their use, disclosure, transmission or storage of your Personal Information.
This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that Rokt does not own or control, or to people that Rokt does not employ or oversee even if Offers, coupons or links to their websites appear within our technology.
As a marketing technology provider, Rokt does not endorse any specific Partner or Advertisers, nor does it take any responsibility for concluding or finalizing Offers on their behalf. Rokt gives you the opportunity to elect to receive information about Offers that you determine are of interest to you – without taking any of your specific personal circumstances into account.
Your privacy rights
Where provided for by applicable law where you are located, you may have a number of rights regarding the processing of your Personal Information, including some or all of the following rights:

Non-discrimination and applicability of these rights
Other users may have similar rights granted to them under local laws. In such case we will act in accordance with those laws.  You will not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights.   We may deny certain requests, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. As noted earlier, if you are an employee or contractor, or if you are a job applicant, your rights with respect to your Personal Information collected in those contexts will be described in a separate privacy notice that we provide to you where and when appropriate.

Verification and security
We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your requests. The verification steps will vary depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the nature of your request. Note as a security measure, to ensure that we properly identify you, such requests will only be actioned in respect of, and confirmed by way of reply email to, the specific email address from which the request was made. Note we will refuse requests made in respect of email addresses which a user cannot access. User requests will be answered as soon as possible but not later than one month after they are made or such other time that may be required under applicable privacy laws.
How do I withdraw consent / unsubscribe from marketing communications?
Withdrawing consent from Rokt for direct marketing communications / unsubscribing
Where you have given your consent for specific purposes, such as sending direct marketing by electronic mail, Rokt provides a facility for you to withdraw such consent for Rokt to process the Personal Information for that purpose. Note there are no adverse consequences for withdrawing your consent.
To unsubscribe from:
any
specific
electronic correspondence from Rokt, use the ‘unsubscribe’ link contained in emails we send you or reply “
STOP
” to any SMS message you receive;
all
future email correspondence from Rokt, please send an email to
privacy@rokt.com
with the subject “
Withdraw Consent
” and we will unsubscribe you from all communications we send you.
Note: if you withdraw consent, we will keep a copy of your email address on file to record that you have withdrawn your consent, and we will retain any information not provided on the basis of consent, and any information to the extent necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal rights. Even if you opt-out, we will still send you non-marketing emails, such as emails about recent transactions or updates to our legal terms.
Withdrawing consent from Rokt’s Advertisers and Partners for direct marketing communications / unsubscribing
In order to withdraw consent from our Advertiser and Partners, to exercise your data subject rights or to otherwise access, update or delete any of your Personal Information retained by them, you should contact them directly.
Where Rokt Advertisers and Partners have integrated with the Rokt unsubscribe mirroring service, where you request to unsubscribe from any further email correspondence from Rokt, you will be presented with the option to also unsubscribe from the applicable Rokt Partner or Advertiser’s communications at the same time. This may only be done by following the unsubscribe link contained in the emails we send you, and will be confirmed at the time of making the unsubscribe.
Otherwise, if you wish to unsubscribe from any further electronic correspondence from a Rokt Partner or Advertiser, you should submit a request to those organizations directly using the unsubscribe facility provided by them, or otherwise as described in their communications to you, or as set out in their privacy policy.
Is unsubscribing the same as opting out?
No. Unsubscribing/ withdrawing consent means we won’t send future electronic communications to you unless you sign up again to subsequent Offers. However, if you want to avoid in the future seeing any third-party Advertiser Offers on Rokt Sites, you should ‘opt out’. The next section deals with Opting Out.
How do I opt out of Offers?
Opting out from Advertiser Offers
Rokt provides a facility for you to opt out of seeing all future third-party Advertiser Offers on Rokt Sites (thereby avoiding any targeted third-party Offers in the future).
To request this please send an email to
privacy@rokt.com
with the subject “Opt Out”. Note we will keep a copy of your email address on file to retain a record that you have opted out. If you use another email with a Rokt Partner, then you may need to opt out from multiple email addresses in order to ensure you don’t see any targeted third-party Offers in future.
Even if you opt out you will still need to unsubscribe directly from any of our Partners’ or Advertisers’ mailing lists if you want to stop receiving electronic communications from them.
Opting out from Partner Offers
Even if you opt out you will still see offers from Partners which are native to the Partner’s site. You cannot opt out from seeing first party Partner Offers.
