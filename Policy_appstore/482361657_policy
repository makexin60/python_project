about us
Your privacy is very important to us
WalkThru Publications is a UK based developer and publisher of games for mobile devices. We respect your privacy and strive to ensure we do not collect personal information on our servers.
3rd Party suppliers, such as App and Google  for advertising, do collect data, and we conform to their standards and procedures.
Further details about this are contained within this Privacy Notice.
Our privacy policy covers the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information collected when you visit our website or download our games and applications, and any information shared with us by our business partners (which we refer to as “Services”).
The services we use may have their own privacy policies, and we strongly recommend that you read their policies as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or services.
The Information Collection and Use
WalkThru does not collect information via registration, or directly from our website and apps, with the exception of when you contact us and ask for support.
We do use information collected via app stores and ad providers for the purposes of understanding how our users review our apps and also anonymous information such as the general location of basic usage of the apps we provide.
Information Provided by Third Parties
When you download an Application, we have access to information as permitted by the app store provider (usually the Apple App Store or Google Play). The App Store will often allow us to access information relating to “crashes” of our games and apps. We use this to diagnose and fix problems in our software, and then do not access this information again. We also read and sometimes respond to any reviews you post.
We also receive your personal information from app stores, analytics and advertising partners. They provide other information that is indirectly collected as you use our games and apps. For example, your IP address, device type, unique device identification number, browser-type, general geographic location device serial number or MAC address, the open Unique Device Identifier (UDID) of the device and other related technical information. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes to improve our games and apps.

Use of Your Information
We do not share your personal information with any third parties other than as described in this Privacy Notice except when required by law. For example, if we are legally required to respond to a subpoena, court order, or any other legal process.
If your data is shared with us via our partners, such as  Apple or Google, your information is kept secure and is used in accordance with our agreement with the relevant third partners policies. We do not share this information other than as set out in our Privacy Notice or unless specifically authorized or required by law.
Ad Serving Technology
Our games and apps include advertising to fund their development. The advertisers collect and use information about you, such as your session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address. This information may be used to provide advertisements of interest to you. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more likely to be tailored to your particular interests.
By using our games and applications, you agree that such third-party advertisers may collect and use data and information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the information practices of advertisers and partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by advertisers and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from our own Privacy Notice. If you do not want to have your information shared with these advertisers, do not use our games or apps.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 16. If we learn that we have collected personal information of an individual under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
