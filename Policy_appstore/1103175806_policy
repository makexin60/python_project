Privacy Policy
Zoetis (“Zoetis”, “we” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes what information we may collect about you, how we may use and share it, how we protect it, and what choices you have on how that information is used. At Zoetis, we want you to feel as comfortable as possible visiting our websites and using our Services.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information we collect when you:
Visit this Website or another website owned, maintained, or controlled by Zoetis;
View or click on any of our online content, or interact with a chatbot on our websites;
Receive or reply to email or other electronic communications from us;
Interact with us on our social media pages, channels, or websites;
Create an account or otherwise register for, or purchase, services;
Fill out a survey, complete a questionnaire or quiz, or participate in a promotion, giveaway, or sweepstakes, or apply for scholarships;
Purchase a product from us or are party to a transaction with us;
Use software applications made available by us on computers or mobile devices; and
Interact off-line with us, such as during site visits or by attending, live or virtually, an event or conference.
Collectively, we refer to the above as “Services.”
The Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws and jurisdictions of any state, country or territory other than those of the United States. Zoetis has multiple websites each with their own content, features, and functionality and with different services. You are advised to review the Privacy Policy specific to the service/site where they are posted.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control. We may provide third party content or links to third party websites or applications, but the inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. When you interact with a third party, you should also read such third party's privacy policies and terms of service to make sure you understand how third party might collect and share information about you.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook,
Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our mobile applications or our social media pages.
What Information We Collect
The type of personal information we collect varies based on the Services provided. Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. During a Service, we may collect personal information, including name, home and mobile phone numbers, postal address, email address, payment card and third-party payment services information, and photographs and videos.
Unless specifically requested, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose to us, any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background)
How We Collect Information
We collect personal information directly from you through the Services we provide. For example, you may provide your contact information when you register on our Website in order to receive information about, or purchase, our products.
In addition, we may gather information about you indirectly through your use of the Services. For example, we might track information provided to us automatically by your browser, including, but not limited to, your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, the website you came from (known as the referring URL), the type of browser you use, your location, mobile carrier, connection type and the time and date of access, and other information collected via/used by cookies. Please see the section below on Use of Cookies and Other Similar Technologies for more information.
We may also use or augment the personal information we have about you with information obtained from other sources, such as public data bases and social media platforms, and with information provided to us by third parties. For example, we may collect information from other sources
to verify the licensure status and identity of veterinarians or other animal-health care professionals who register on our Website.
If you submit any personal information of other people to us, such as in connection with our Tell-A-Friend referral function, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How We Use Information
We may use personal information we collect for legitimate business purposes, including to:
Develop, operate, promote, improve and market our products and services or other animal-health related products or services;
Connect you with third parties;
Process purchases and other transactions;

Establish and defend legal rights, protect our operations and pursue available remedies;
Conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all our assets; and
Verify your identity.
We may also use personal information for any other purpose that we disclose at the time we collect your information.
We may also aggregate or deidentify personal information you provide and use it for any purpose, including product and service development and improvement activities and market analysis. Aggregated or deidentified information no longer identifies you or any other individual.
How We Share Information
We may share personal information we collect with:
Our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;
Third-party service providers/vendors to facilitate services they provide to us, such as marketing, advertising, market research, website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, chatbot functionality (including through storage of chat transcripts and provision of tools that enable us to analyze your interactions on our websites), customer service, email delivery, auditing, and other services;
Third-parties or affiliates in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a sale, consolidation or merger of a Zoetis business;
Third-parties for other legal reasons, such as to enforce our terms and condition or to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, you or others;
Governmental or other public authorities (including regulators and law enforcement) as permitted or required by law, regulation, or court order; and
Your veterinarian or other animal health professional.
We will limit sharing of your personal information where appropriate and where legally required. We may also disclose to third parties aggregated or deidentified information that is not personally identifiable for any purpose.

This Notice does not govern the use of the website, nor the privacy terms on this website. To learn more about our terms of use, please consult the

WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on the browser or hard drive of your computer (or similar device) by websites that you visit. Cookies are typically used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide various information to the owners of the particular website.
WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE AND WHY?
Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. Cookies are used to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website, and allow us to improve our website.
Whether a cookie is considered as a “first” or “third party” cookie refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those cookies set by a website that is being visited by the user. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie (e.g. Google Analytics).
Whether a cookie is considered as a “persistent” or “session” cookie refers to the duration of the cookie. A persistent cookie remains on a user's device for the period of time specified in that cookie, and is activated each time that said user visits the website that created the concerned cookie. A session cookie allows linking the actions of a user during a browser session. A session starts when a user opens a browser window and ends when the browser window is closed. Once the browser is closed, all session cookies are deleted.
