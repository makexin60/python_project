Brief Overview
Information about how this policy applies to our global company
As a global organization, different Nasdaq entities, products/services and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where you are located. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some Nasdaq entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal requirements imposing it.
For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the “controller” of your Personal Data will be the entity that delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the Site that you are using. You can identify the Nasdaq company that hosts a particular Site through the Site’s footer or “About” link. A list of Nasdaq’s different business locations is available
here
.
Although your data controller may be a specific Nasdaq entity, contact and other customer relationship information that we collect may be held in a customer relationship management or contact database which can be accessed by other Nasdaq entities which may be located globally; further information about international transfers of information is provided below. To the extent required or permitted by applicable law, by visiting or using our Sites, you are consenting to us collecting and processing information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Situations where this privacy policy does not apply
This Privacy Policy also does not apply to Personal Data processed in connection with delivery of services to Nasdaq by suppliers or contractors; such relationships are governed solely by the Personal Data processing terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the supplier/contractor. It also does not apply to job applicants (which are covered by our separate Job Applicant Privacy Policy) or employees, which are subject to relevant separate privacy notices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that:
Nasdaq’s contract for delivery of products or service prescribes different Personal Data terms and conditions for the processing of your information;
Nasdaq is delivering products or services as a data processor in which the contractual terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the controller/contracting party shall govern;
The Site for the products or services sets forth an additional or alternative Privacy Policy; or
Applicable law imposes different processing or privacy requirements on your information.

With respect to situations where we process Personal Data based on our legitimate business interest, reflecting that, outside of certain direct consumer interactions, such as our Nasdaq+ services, we are generally a business-to-business product and service provider, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about corporate customer points of contact and individuals acting in their professional capacities as part of our overall effect to reduce the privacy impact on individuals. To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on a legitimate interest as legal basis. Please see the section below regarding your rights to find out more. Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Automated Decision-Making
Nasdaq does not engage decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning an individual or similarly significantly affects an individual.
As part of Nasdaq’s surveillance programs for its exchanges, we utilize certain software that uses machine intelligence and learning to identify situations that potentially constitute market abuse, insider trading, fraud or violations of our published rules. Such software relies on identifying patterns indicating misconduct based on past activity. The conduct involved may include conduct by a corporate member, trading algorithm or individual action. Alerts are referred for investigation by our Surveillance team which determines which actions to take based on our published rules and applicable law.
How We Share Your Information
From time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to any contractual limitations on sharing Personal Data set forth in a relevant contract for products and services, we may share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, customers/members (such as where we process your Personal Data in connection with your role with your employer or financial services provider), third party service providers and authorities in the following circumstances:

Rights for users in the UK, EU and other jurisdictions outside of the United States
To the extent required by applicable law, in our capacity as the controller of your Personal Data, we will also provide you with the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your Personal Data and at any time to access, correct, update, oppose, delete, block, limit or object to our use of your Personal Data. The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations that apply to our business – for example, financial regulations that apply to our EEA Regulated Business - may prevent us from immediately deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.
To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide additional information that will help us identify which information is yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority.
The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your Personal Data is processed subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation:
Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of processing.
You have the right to request:
Access to your Personal Data. This means that you have the right to request information on our use of your Personal Data. You also have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data being processed at no cost. However, we may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you with additional copies of the Personal Data. If you make your access request by electronic means such as email, we will provide you with the information in a commonly used electronic format.
Rectification of your Personal Data. We will at your request, or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymize, erase or complement Personal Data that you or we discover is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right to complete the Personal Data with additional data if relevant information is missing.
Erasure of your Personal Data. You have the right to request that we erase your Personal Data if we do no longer have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this, erasure shall be made by us if:
the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,
we use your Personal Data with your consent and you withdraw your consent,
you object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding legitimate ground for the processing,
the Personal Data has not been lawfully processed,
we are required to erase the Personal Data due to a legal obligation, or
you are a child and we have collected the Personal Data in relation to the offer of information society services.
However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your Personal Data. In such case, we will stop using your Personal Data for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable law, or the relevant compelling reason.
Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily restrict the processing of your Personal Data. You have the right to request restriction of the processing when:
you have requested rectification of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we are verifying the accuracy of the data,
the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal Data to be erased,
as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
you have objected to our legitimate interest for the processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest overrides your privacy rights.
We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any recipients of your Personal Data regarding any rectification, erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal Data.
Right to object to processing.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or if continued processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
Right to portability.
You have the right to receive certain of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller. You only have this right when your Personal Data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the processing is performance of a contract between you and us.
Right to lodge a complaint.
You have the right to lodge any complaints regarding our processing of your Personal Data with the supervisory authority.
Security of Your Information
We employ a number of technical, administrative and physical security measures designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.
International Transfers
Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as detailed in “
How We Share Your Information
”, may be located in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home country. Where required, Nasdaq has implemented appropriate cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain Personal Data, including, but not limited to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (available at
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using our Sites, and providing us information about you, you consent to the international transfer of information about you to the above parties.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain each category of Personal Data identified below for as long as reasonably necessary to maintain the Sites, to meet legal and accounting obligations, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by law, unless specifically authorized to be retained longer.

You can request to opt-out of this “sale” of your Personal Data here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request.

Brief Overview
Information about how this policy applies to our global company
As a global organization, different Nasdaq entities, products/services and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where you are located. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some Nasdaq entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal requirements imposing it.
For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the “controller” of your Personal Data will be the entity that delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the Site that you are using. You can identify the Nasdaq company that hosts a particular Site through the Site’s footer or “About” link. A list of Nasdaq’s different business locations is available
here
.
Although your data controller may be a specific Nasdaq entity, contact and other customer relationship information that we collect may be held in a customer relationship management or contact database which can be accessed by other Nasdaq entities which may be located globally; further information about international transfers of information is provided below. To the extent required or permitted by applicable law, by visiting or using our Sites, you are consenting to us collecting and processing information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Situations where this privacy policy does not apply
This Privacy Policy also does not apply to Personal Data processed in connection with delivery of services to Nasdaq by suppliers or contractors; such relationships are governed solely by the Personal Data processing terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the supplier/contractor. It also does not apply to job applicants (which are covered by our separate Job Applicant Privacy Policy) or employees, which are subject to relevant separate privacy notices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that:
Nasdaq’s contract for delivery of products or service prescribes different Personal Data terms and conditions for the processing of your information;
Nasdaq is delivering products or services as a data processor in which the contractual terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the controller/contracting party shall govern;
The Site for the products or services sets forth an additional or alternative Privacy Policy; or
Applicable law imposes different processing or privacy requirements on your information.

We may use the information we collect for the purposes identified below.

With respect to situations where we process Personal Data based on our legitimate business interest, reflecting that, outside of certain direct consumer interactions, such as our Nasdaq+ services, we are generally a business-to-business product and service provider, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about corporate customer points of contact and individuals acting in their professional capacities as part of our overall effect to reduce the privacy impact on individuals. To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on a legitimate interest as legal basis. Please see the section below regarding your rights to find out more. Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Automated Decision-Making
Nasdaq does not engage decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning an individual or similarly significantly affects an individual.
As part of Nasdaq’s surveillance programs for its exchanges, we utilize certain software that uses machine intelligence and learning to identify situations that potentially constitute market abuse, insider trading, fraud or violations of our published rules. Such software relies on identifying patterns indicating misconduct based on past activity. The conduct involved may include conduct by a corporate member, trading algorithm or individual action. Alerts are referred for investigation by our Surveillance team which determines which actions to take based on our published rules and applicable law.
How We Share Your Information
From time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to any contractual limitations on sharing Personal Data set forth in a relevant contract for products and services, we may share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, customers/members (such as where we process your Personal Data in connection with your role with your employer or financial services provider), third party service providers and authorities in the following circumstances:

Advertising Partners
.
Third-party advertising companies for the interest-based advertising purposes described above.
Business Transfers.
We may transfer your information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, brands, affiliates, subsidiaries or other assets; to the extent that such a transaction results in you being a current or prospective customer, vendor or other third party point-of-contact for both the portion of the business that is transferred and the portion that remains with Nasdaq, your information may be both transferred to the transferee and retained by Nasdaq. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information with a prospective buyer or transferee of the business as part of the diligence process provided that we require any such third party to maintain the confidentiality of your information and protect it with appropriate technical and organizational security measures.
Other Users and the Public
. Your account and other user-generated content data (except for messages) may be visible to other users of the Site and the public. For example, other users of the Site or the public may have access to your information if you chose to make your account or other personal information available to them through the Service, such as when you provide comments, reviews, survey responses, or share other content.  This information can be seen, collected and used by others, including being cached, copied, screen captured or stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines), and we are not responsible for any such use of this information.
We may share your information with other parties as directed by you or subject to your consent. We may also share and otherwise process aggregated information or de-identified information that does not identify you individually with other parties. For example, from time to time, we may utilize survey information collected from you on an aggregate, not individually identifiable, basis. We also use this aggregated or de-identified information for our various business purposes, including the creation and sale of other products and services to our clients and potential clients. This aggregate or de-identified information is not traceable to any particular client or user and will not be used by a third party to contact you.
For certain Sites that are intended for public use, news posting and other information distribution, the Site works on advertising-supported basis. On such sites, we may participate with third parties who provide services related to the advertising appearing on such Site or provide us information on your use of our Sites; such third parties may operate as a “data controller” with respect to Personal Data collected by them from your use of our site which they may use to provide tailored advertising to you on the Site or other sites of their customers.  We post a current list of such third parties along with a link to their respective privacy policies on our
Website Third Party Participant List.
Marketing Communications and Advertising
We process Personal Data within the scope of our marketing and market segmentation. With market segmentation, we mean that we categorize our customer base based on professional affiliations and functions, alignment with our services and products and information gathered from public sources of information. For customers or users of our Sites, we may also use information gathered from your use of our products, services and/or Sites for marketing purposes to market our products and services to you, as well as to tailor advertisements of products and services of our advertisers, sponsors and partners to you when you are on our Sites. You always have right to request that we stop using your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on a legitimate interest as legal basis. You also always have the right to withdraw your consent at any time when we need your consent in order to process your Personal Data. If you withdraw your consent, you will no longer receive information and offers that are tailored for you. Please see the section below for more information about your rights.
If you no longer wish to receive direct marketing communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails by: (1) using the unsubscribe method provided in our communications; (2) if you created an online account when you registered to receive our emails, you may log-in to your account on the applicable Site and make changes to your communication preferences; or (3) you can opt out by updating your preferences in the Email Alert section of our Sites. In particular, you have the right to object our use of your Personal Data for direct marketing and in certain other situations (in accordance with applicable law) by contacting us at
privacy@nasdaq.com
. If you are having difficulty unsubscribing from our email marketing communications using the above methods, please contact us as at
privacy@nasdaq.com
.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable as required by applicable law. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request, or for other purposes as required or permitted by applicable law. In addition, please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing communications from one or all of our Sites, we may need to send you service-related communications.
We, our service providers and our third-party advertising partners may also process your Personal Data and information about your interactions (including the data described in the ’information we collect from you, your representee, or automatically’ above) with the Sites, our communications and other online services over time, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. This is called interest-based advertising. We may also share information about our users with these companies to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms.
Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
In this section, we describe the rights and choices available to all users. Users who are located outside of the United States, or in California or other US states with omnibus consumer privacy laws can find information about their additional rights
below
.
Delete your content or cancel your account
.
You can choose to delete certain content through your account. If you wish to cancel your account, you can do so at any time through your account portal or please
contact us
.
Linked third-party platforms
. If you choose to connect to the Sites through your social media account or other third-party platform, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.

Rights for users in the UK, EU and other jurisdictions outside of the United States
To the extent required by applicable law, in our capacity as the controller of your Personal Data, we will also provide you with the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your Personal Data and at any time to access, correct, update, oppose, delete, block, limit or object to our use of your Personal Data. The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations that apply to our business – for example, financial regulations that apply to our EEA Regulated Business - may prevent us from immediately deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.
To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide additional information that will help us identify which information is yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority.
The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your Personal Data is processed subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation:
Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of processing.
You have the right to request:
Access to your Personal Data. This means that you have the right to request information on our use of your Personal Data. You also have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data being processed at no cost. However, we may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you with additional copies of the Personal Data. If you make your access request by electronic means such as email, we will provide you with the information in a commonly used electronic format.
Rectification of your Personal Data. We will at your request, or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymize, erase or complement Personal Data that you or we discover is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right to complete the Personal Data with additional data if relevant information is missing.
Erasure of your Personal Data. You have the right to request that we erase your Personal Data if we do no longer have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this, erasure shall be made by us if:
the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,
we use your Personal Data with your consent and you withdraw your consent,
you object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding legitimate ground for the processing,
the Personal Data has not been lawfully processed,
we are required to erase the Personal Data due to a legal obligation, or
you are a child and we have collected the Personal Data in relation to the offer of information society services.
However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your Personal Data. In such case, we will stop using your Personal Data for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable law, or the relevant compelling reason.
Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily restrict the processing of your Personal Data. You have the right to request restriction of the processing when:
you have requested rectification of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we are verifying the accuracy of the data,
the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal Data to be erased,
as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
you have objected to our legitimate interest for the processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest overrides your privacy rights.
We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any recipients of your Personal Data regarding any rectification, erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal Data.
Right to object to processing.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or if continued processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
Right to portability.
You have the right to receive certain of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller. You only have this right when your Personal Data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the processing is performance of a contract between you and us.
Right to lodge a complaint.
You have the right to lodge any complaints regarding our processing of your Personal Data with the supervisory authority.
Security of Your Information
We employ a number of technical, administrative and physical security measures designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.
International Transfers
Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as detailed in “
How We Share Your Information
”, may be located in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home country. Where required, Nasdaq has implemented appropriate cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain Personal Data, including, but not limited to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (available at
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using our Sites, and providing us information about you, you consent to the international transfer of information about you to the above parties.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain each category of Personal Data identified below for as long as reasonably necessary to maintain the Sites, to meet legal and accounting obligations, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by law, unless specifically authorized to be retained longer.

California Notice at Collection/US State Law Privacy Notice
Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to residents of California and other states to extent they have privacy laws applicable to us that grant their residents the rights described below.  For purposes of this section, Personal Data has the meaning given to “personal data”, “personal information” or similar terms under the applicable privacy laws of the state in which you reside.  Please note that not all rights listed below may be afforded to all users and that if you are not a resident of the relevant states, you may not be able to exercise these rights. In addition, we may not be able to process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to confirm your identity or understand and respond to it.
In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of residents of these states, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply with respect to the activities it describes instead of this section.
Your privacy rights
. You may have some or all of the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.

Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request.

This Privacy Policy includes important information about your personal data and we encourage you to read it carefully.
Welcome
We provide financial infrastructure for the internet. Individuals and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to facilitate purchases, accept payments, send payouts, and manage online businesses.
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the Personal Data that we collect, how we use and share it, and details on how you can reach us with privacy-related inquiries. The Policy also outlines your rights and choices as a data subject, including the right to object to certain uses of your Personal Data.
Depending on the activity, Stripe assumes the role of a “data controller” and/or “data processor” (or “service provider”). For more details about our privacy practices, including our role, the specific Stripe entity responsible under this Policy, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit our
Privacy Center
.
Defined Terms
In this Policy, “Stripe”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refers to the Stripe entity responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document. Depending on your jurisdiction, the specific Stripe entity accountable for your Personal Data might vary.
Learn More
.
“Personal Data” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and that we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).
“Services” refers to the products, services, devices, and applications, that we provide under the Stripe Services Agreement (“Business Services”) or the Stripe Consumer Terms of Service (“End User Services”); websites (“Sites”) like Stripe.com and Link.com; and other Stripe applications and online services. We provide Business Services to entities (“Business Users”). We provide End User Services directly to individuals for their personal use.
“Financial Partners” are financial institutions, banks, and other partners such as payment method acquirers, payout providers, and card networks that we partner with to provide the Services.
Depending on the context, “you” might be an End Customer, End User, Representative, or Visitor:
End Users.
When you use an End User Service, such as saving a payment method with Link, for personal use we refer to you as an “End User.”
End Customers.
When you are not directly transacting with Stripe, but we receive your Personal Data to provide Services to a Business User, including when you make a purchase from a Business User on a Stripe Checkout page or receive payments from a Business User, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”
Representatives.
When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User—perhaps as a company founder, account administrator for a Business User, or a recipient of an employee credit card from a Business User via Stripe Issuing—we refer to you as a “Representative.”
Visitors.
When you interact with Stripe by visiting a Site without being logged into a Stripe account, or when your interaction with Stripe does not involve you being an End User, End Customer, or Representative, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Stripe asking for more information about our Services.
In this Policy, “Transaction Data” refers to data collected and used by Stripe to facilitate transactions you request. Some Transaction Data is Personal Data and may include: your name, email address, contact number, billing and shipping address, payment method information (like credit or debit card number, bank account details, or payment card image chosen by you), merchant and location details, amount and date of purchase, and in some instances, information about what was purchased.

1. Personal Data we collect and how we use and share it
Our collection and use of Personal Data differs based on whether you are an End User, End Customer, Representative, or Visitor, and the specific Service that you are using. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who wants to use our Business Services, we may collect your Personal Data to onboard your business; at the same time, you might also be an End Customer if you've bought goods from another Business User that is using our Services for payment processing. You could also be an End User if you used our End User Service, such as Link, for those transactions.
1.1 End Users
We provide End User Services when we provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g., Link). Additional details regarding our collection, usage, and sharing of End User Personal Data, including the
legal bases
we rely on for processing such data, can be found in our
Privacy Center
.
a. Personal Data we collect about End Users
Using Link or Connecting your bank account
