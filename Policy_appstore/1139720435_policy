Brief Overview
Information about how this policy applies to our global company
As a global organization, different Nasdaq entities, products/services and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where you are located. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some Nasdaq entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal requirements imposing it.
For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the “controller” of your Personal Data will be the entity that delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the Site that you are using. You can identify the Nasdaq company that hosts a particular Site through the Site’s footer or “About” link. A list of Nasdaq’s different business locations is available
here
.
Although your data controller may be a specific Nasdaq entity, contact and other customer relationship information that we collect may be held in a customer relationship management or contact database which can be accessed by other Nasdaq entities which may be located globally; further information about international transfers of information is provided below. To the extent required or permitted by applicable law, by visiting or using our Sites, you are consenting to us collecting and processing information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Situations where this privacy policy does not apply
This Privacy Policy also does not apply to Personal Data processed in connection with delivery of services to Nasdaq by suppliers or contractors; such relationships are governed solely by the Personal Data processing terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the supplier/contractor. It also does not apply to job applicants (which are covered by our separate Job Applicant Privacy Policy) or employees, which are subject to relevant separate privacy notices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that:
Nasdaq’s contract for delivery of products or service prescribes different Personal Data terms and conditions for the processing of your information;
Nasdaq is delivering products or services as a data processor in which the contractual terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the controller/contracting party shall govern;
The Site for the products or services sets forth an additional or alternative Privacy Policy; or
Applicable law imposes different processing or privacy requirements on your information.

With respect to situations where we process Personal Data based on our legitimate business interest, reflecting that, outside of certain direct consumer interactions, such as our Nasdaq+ services, we are generally a business-to-business product and service provider, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about corporate customer points of contact and individuals acting in their professional capacities as part of our overall effect to reduce the privacy impact on individuals. To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on a legitimate interest as legal basis. Please see the section below regarding your rights to find out more. Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Automated Decision-Making
Nasdaq does not engage decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning an individual or similarly significantly affects an individual.
As part of Nasdaq’s surveillance programs for its exchanges, we utilize certain software that uses machine intelligence and learning to identify situations that potentially constitute market abuse, insider trading, fraud or violations of our published rules. Such software relies on identifying patterns indicating misconduct based on past activity. The conduct involved may include conduct by a corporate member, trading algorithm or individual action. Alerts are referred for investigation by our Surveillance team which determines which actions to take based on our published rules and applicable law.
How We Share Your Information
From time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to any contractual limitations on sharing Personal Data set forth in a relevant contract for products and services, we may share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, customers/members (such as where we process your Personal Data in connection with your role with your employer or financial services provider), third party service providers and authorities in the following circumstances:

Rights for users in the UK, EU and other jurisdictions outside of the United States
To the extent required by applicable law, in our capacity as the controller of your Personal Data, we will also provide you with the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your Personal Data and at any time to access, correct, update, oppose, delete, block, limit or object to our use of your Personal Data. The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations that apply to our business – for example, financial regulations that apply to our EEA Regulated Business - may prevent us from immediately deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.
To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide additional information that will help us identify which information is yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority.
The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your Personal Data is processed subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation:
Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of processing.
You have the right to request:
Access to your Personal Data. This means that you have the right to request information on our use of your Personal Data. You also have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data being processed at no cost. However, we may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you with additional copies of the Personal Data. If you make your access request by electronic means such as email, we will provide you with the information in a commonly used electronic format.
Rectification of your Personal Data. We will at your request, or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymize, erase or complement Personal Data that you or we discover is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right to complete the Personal Data with additional data if relevant information is missing.
Erasure of your Personal Data. You have the right to request that we erase your Personal Data if we do no longer have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this, erasure shall be made by us if:
the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,
we use your Personal Data with your consent and you withdraw your consent,
you object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding legitimate ground for the processing,
the Personal Data has not been lawfully processed,
we are required to erase the Personal Data due to a legal obligation, or
you are a child and we have collected the Personal Data in relation to the offer of information society services.
However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your Personal Data. In such case, we will stop using your Personal Data for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable law, or the relevant compelling reason.
Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily restrict the processing of your Personal Data. You have the right to request restriction of the processing when:
you have requested rectification of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we are verifying the accuracy of the data,
the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal Data to be erased,
as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
you have objected to our legitimate interest for the processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest overrides your privacy rights.
We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any recipients of your Personal Data regarding any rectification, erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal Data.
Right to object to processing.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or if continued processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
Right to portability.
You have the right to receive certain of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller. You only have this right when your Personal Data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the processing is performance of a contract between you and us.
Right to lodge a complaint.
You have the right to lodge any complaints regarding our processing of your Personal Data with the supervisory authority.
Security of Your Information
We employ a number of technical, administrative and physical security measures designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.
International Transfers
Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as detailed in “
How We Share Your Information
”, may be located in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home country. Where required, Nasdaq has implemented appropriate cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain Personal Data, including, but not limited to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (available at
https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en
. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using our Sites, and providing us information about you, you consent to the international transfer of information about you to the above parties.
Retention of Your Information
We will retain each category of Personal Data identified below for as long as reasonably necessary to maintain the Sites, to meet legal and accounting obligations, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required or permitted by law, unless specifically authorized to be retained longer.

Right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Data
. While we do not sell Personal Data for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as a “sale” or “share” of your Personal Data to the companies that provide the services because they collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you. You can request to opt-out of this “sale” of your Personal Data here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request. We do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the Personal Data of California residents who are under 16 years of age. You can also broadcast the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt-out for each participating browser system that you use.  Learn more at the Global Privacy Control website.

In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.

Shine the light law.
Under California’s Shine the Light law (California Civil Code Section 1798.83), California residents may ask companies with whom they have formed a business relationship primarily for personal, family or household purposes to provide the names of third parties to which they have disclosed certain personal information (as defined under the Shine the Light law) during the preceding calendar year for their own direct marketing purposes, and the categories of personal information disclosed. You may send us requests for this information to us as provided in the “Contact Us” section. In your request, you must include the statement “Shine the Light Request,” and provide your first and last name and mailing address and certify that you are a California resident. We reserve the right to require additional information to confirm your identity and California residency. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, mail, or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.
