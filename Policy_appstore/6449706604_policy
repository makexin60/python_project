your Android or Apple account is transmitted to the operator of the respective
app store,
i.e.

General use
In this section we explain the data processing that can take
  place during the use of the app. In the following sections we will explain
  the special functions of the app. We will also inform you about the storage
  period of your data, the legal basis and possible processing of your data
  outside the European Union (EU).
In addition, the general provision and maintenance of the app is
  carried out with the support of service providers who work on our behalf and
  may therefore also be able to view your data to the required extent. We also
  explain the service providers involved individually for each section or
  special function of the app.
Details:
During general use, we process (technical) data about your mobile
  device and your internet connection.
Examples:

  are using.
In addition, each installed Beauty App receives a pseudonymous
  user ID (
e.g.

·
Beauty App User ID
  (User ID)
The user ID is mandatory
in order to
be
  able to distinguish between the users of the Beauty App and to be able to
  offer the functions of the app.
Storage period:
Our protocols (logs) are deleted after max. 90 days.
Legal basis:
The data is technically required
in order to
be able to offer you the Beauty App and to ensure the stability and security
  of the Beauty App (Art. 6 (1) (f)) GDPR, § 25 II TTDSG).
We process the Beauty App user ID (BAT User ID) within the
  framework of our terms and conditions (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).
Participating service providers:
We use the services of Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS) to provide
  the Beauty App.
Processing outside the EU:
Despite the server location within the EU, data processing within
  the scope of providing the Beauty App via AWS in countries outside the EU
  cannot be ruled out. For the exceptional cases in which your data is
  transmitted to the US or other countries outside the EU (
e.g.
as part of technical support), we have implemented suitable data protection
  guarantees. These are the standard contractual clauses of the European Union,
  which we will be happy to make available to you on request.
3.1

  all the functions of the Beauty App. For your permanent user profile, we
  absolutely need a (fictitious) login name chosen by you. A profile picture,
  however, is not required. Entering your e-mail address is used to recover a
  forgotten password and possibly to register for the newsletter.
  Alternatively, you can also use the Beauty App with a guest profile. However,
  not all functions are then fully available to you.
Details:
The following data
  is required when registering in the
app
·
Login name
·
E-mail address for
  password recovery
After registration, you can add further data to your account on a
  voluntary basis.

  contractual clauses in accordance
with  Art.
46 GDPR were concluded as suitable guarantees, which we would be happy
  to make available to you on request.
3.2
Social
logins
We may offer you the option in our services to register directly
with us using your social network account. If you want to use this function,
you will first be forwarded to the offer of the respective social network.
There you will be prompted to log in with your username and password. Of
course, we do not take any notice of your registration data. If you are already
logged in, this step will be skipped. The respective social network will then
inform you and ask you to confirm which data will be transmitted to us (
e.g.
public profile, friends list, e-mail address and
current place of residence). We use the transmitted data to create your
customer account, although of course we do not save your friends list, for
example. There is no permanent link between your customer account and your
account on the social network.
Storage period:
The data will be processed until you delete your user account.
Legal basis:
Our terms of use, (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).
Participating service providers:
Depending on the chosen login platform, these can be the
  following providers:
·

  be redirected to third parties who process your data outside the EU and
  possibly in a third country. We have no influence on this data processing.
3.3
Share
content:
If the operating system you are using has its own function for
sharing app content, you can call this up in our apps using the Share or
Recommend button to share content or recommend products. Depending on the
functions your device or operating system has and how you have configured your
device, you can also use social networks to share in this way. We would like to
point out that the sharing function used by our app is an operating system
function. We have no knowledge of the recipients and the content of your
communication. You can get more information about the sharing function and your
configuration options from the manufacturer of your device. The social networks
available to you for sharing content depend on which social networks you are a
member of and how you have configured your member account and device. You can
find more information in the respective data protection notices of the social
networks you use.
3.4
Push
notifications
Push notifications are notifications that can be displayed on
  your mobile device without opening the Beauty App.
We provide you through these
notifications
information about various events, such as information on current studies and
  campaigns as well as helpful tips and tricks for using our products and your
  personal routine.
In addition, we can also inform you regularly about an update of
  the Beauty App and new functions.
No sensitive content is displayed within a push notification. You
  can adapt the display of push notifications to your needs in the settings of
  the Beauty App and in the settings of your mobile device.
Details:
Additional (pseudonymous) data is transmitted to our servers for
  the delivery of notifications about (firmware) updates and new functions of
  the Beauty App. This is data about your mobile device and certain events that
  are triggered within the Beauty App while our messages are being displayed.
Examples:
·
App ID for every
  mobile device
·
Hardware ID for
  every mobile device (only for the guest profile)
·
App start
time
·
Notification was
  displayed /
clicked
If you use a user profile (login name), the app ID is linked to
  your user ID. If you use a guest profile, an additional pseudonymous hardware
  ID (
e.g.
4hvtjtv4j-5646-5456-gkicv-6sl44t443) will
  be created instead of the user ID and linked to your app ID. The app ID and
  the hardware ID are mandatory
in order to
be able to
  distinguish the users of the Beauty App and to be able to send the push
  notifications for (firmware) updates to your mobile device.
The actual amount of data transmitted depends on the operating
  system of your mobile device and your individual settings.
Storage period:
Our logs for push notifications are deleted when they are no
  longer required. If you delete your user profile and thus also the individual
  user ID assigned by us, our logs can no longer be related to individuals.
The push notifications themselves are saved in the logs of your
  mobile device without any specific content.
Legal basis:
The push notifications are delivered
on the
  basis of
your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a)) GDPR, § 25 I TTDSG). You can
  revoke your consent to the delivery of push notifications at any time in the
  Beauty App settings.
Participating service providers:
The delivery of push notifications with messages about an
  available (firmware) update or new functions of the Beauty App is implemented
  with the Mobile Engage technology, a software development kit (SDK) from our
  service provider
Emarsys
eMarketing Systems GmbH.
Data processing outside the EU:
Despite the server location within the EU, data processing in the
  context of the Mobile Engage technology from
Emarsys
eMarketing Systems GmbH in countries outside the EU cannot be ruled
  out. For the exceptional cases in which your data is transmitted to the
  US or other countries outside the EU (
e.g.
as part
  of technical support), we have implemented suitable data protection
  guarantees. These are the standard contractual clauses of the European Union,
  which we will be happy to make available to you on request.
3.5

notifications
In-app notifications are messages that are displayed within the
  Beauty App during use. With your consent, we would like to occasionally show
  you in-app notifications.
Examples:
·
Information on (new) app features
  (explanations, tutorials, etc.)
·
Attractive offers
  around the beauty offer
·
Links to voluntary
  surveys (outside the app)
You can (de)activate the display of in-app notifications in the
  settings of the Beauty App.

  within the Beauty App while our messages are being displayed.
Examples:
·
App ID for every
  mobile device
·
Hardware ID for
  every mobile device (only for the guest profile)
·
App start
time
·
Notification was
  displayed /

If you use a user profile (login name), the app ID is linked to
  your user ID. If you use a guest profile, an additional pseudonymous hardware
  ID (
e.g.
4hvtjtv4j-5646-5456-gkicv-6sl44t443) will
  be created instead of the user ID and linked to your app ID. The app ID and
  the hardware ID are mandatory
in order to
be able to
  distinguish the users of the Beauty App and to be able to send the in-app
  notifications to your mobile device.
The actual amount of data transmitted depends on the operating
  system (iOS or Android) of your mobile device and your individual settings.
Storage period:
Our in-app notification logs are deleted after 90 days. If you
  delete your user profile and thus also the individual user ID assigned by us,
  our logs can no longer be related to individuals.
Legal basis:
The in-app notifications are delivered with your consent (Art. 6
  (1) (a) GDPR, § 25 I TTDSG). You can revoke your consent at any time in the
  settings of the Beauty App.
Participating service providers:
The in-app notifications are delivered using the Mobile Engage

Despite the server location within the EU, data processing in the
  context of the Mobile Engage technology from
Emarsys
eMarketing Systems GmbH in countries outside the EU cannot be ruled
  out. For the exceptional cases in which your data is transmitted to the
  US or other countries outside the EU (

  of technical support), we have implemented suitable data protection
  guarantees. These are the standard contractual clauses of the European Union,
  which we will be happy to make available to you on request.
3.6

  App. This data enables us to analyze possible errors and crashes in the
  Beauty App. With your consent, you allow us access to the diagnostic data
in order to
improve the Beauty App.

you can find the functions and products that interest you and we can make our
app user-friendly, we analyze your individual usage behavior in the app if you
have given your consent.
In order to
analyze and regularly improve the use of our app, we use Google Analytics and
Emarsys
Predict technology. Our goal is to use the
statistics obtained to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you
as a user. We also receive information about the functionality of our app here.
Details:
To do this, we use data from ad technologies both in and outside
  our services, pixels, tags, cookies and device identifiers, data from your
  use of our services (
e.g.

5
Functions and Features of the Beauty App
In this section we explain possible data processing in the context
of the special functions and features of the Beauty App.
5.1
Skin
Scan
The Beauty App gives you the option of
using images (especially selfies) to receive an evaluation of the individual
characteristics of your skin. This requires access to the (selfie) camera
function of your smartphone and a stable internet connection. The skin scan can
also be used without registering in the app. However, not all functionalities
of the app are then available to you.
Details:
With this so-called Skin Scan, the condition and texture of your
  facial skin is analyzed using artificial intelligence based on the selfies
  that have been taken. For example, we can then determine the evenness and
  firmness of your skin. If you have also entered your skin type and age in
  your account, we will also include this data in the analysis.
The recordings you made could also provide information about your
  ethnic origin. However, this is not the focus of the processing. We do not
  actively use this data.
If you have registered in our app, additional functions are
  available to you. This enables us to show you personalized skin care and
  product recommendations as well as recommendations for your daily skin
  routine based on the analysis results and any additional data that may have
  been provided, such as age, gender, skin type and individual goals. With your
  digital skin diary, the development of your skin can also be tracked.
Optionally, you can contribute to us improving and researching
  the Beauty App functionalities by giving separate consent to the storage of
  your photos. The storage refers to the creation of quality evaluations and
  statistics as well as possible error corrections and for the training and
  improvement of the AI for the analysis of the photos.
The actual amount of data transferred depends on whether you have
  already registered in the app and how you have configured your privacy
  settings in the app.
In principle, the following data can be transmitted to us as part
  of the Skin Scan:
·
Skin scan photos
  (storage only with consent)
·
Skin scan results /
  individual characteristics of your skin
·
Data about your routines
  and results
·
Number of your
  sessions
Storage period:
If you have a user account with us and have agreed to the further
  storage of your photos by us, these photos will first be used to carry out
  the skin analysis and then stored with us for the above-mentioned purposes
  until you revoke your consent or delete your account. In any case, photos
  will be deleted after 5 years at the latest. If you do not have agreed to the
  storage of your photos, the image you use for the skin scan will only be used
  to carry out the skin analysis and will be automatically deleted after the
  analysis.
Legal basis:
Your skin is analyzed in accordance with our terms and conditions
  (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). The photos are only stored with your consent (Art. 6 (1)
  (a) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 9 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke your
  consent at any time in the settings of the Beauty App.
Participating service providers:
We use the services of Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS) for data
  storage and analysis as a data processor for us. In addition, certain data
  (date of your skin scan, your individually defined
goals
and your skin routines) will be linked to your user profile and, in this
  context, transmitted to
Emarsys
eMarketing Systems
  GmbH,
Zeppelinstrasse
2, 85399
Hallbergmoos
Germany (hereinafter referred to as EMARSYS) as a data processor for us.
Data processing outside the EU:
Despite the server location within the EU, data processing within
  the scope of providing the Beauty App via AWS and EMARSYS in countries
  outside the EU cannot be ruled out. For the exceptional cases in which
  your data is transmitted to the US or other countries outside the EU (
e.g.
as part of technical support), we have implemented
  suitable data protection guarantees. These are the standard contractual
  clauses of the European Union, which we will be happy to make available to
  you on request.
5.2
Suggested
products
We reserve the right to make suggestions for skin-improvement
products based on the data we have on file.
Details:
The product suggestions can be based, for example, on your
  individual goals and results of the Skin Scan as well as other data provided
  by you, such as age,
gender
or skin type.
Storage period:
The data will be processed until you delete your user account.
Legal basis:
Our terms of use, (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).
Participating service providers:
For individual product recommendations based on your profile
  data, we use the services of

  location within the EU, data processing by EMARSYS in countries outside the
  EU cannot be ruled out. For the exceptional cases in which your data is
  transmitted to the US or other countries outside the EU (
e.g.
as part of technical support), we have implemented suitable data protection
  guarantees. These are the standard contractual clauses of the European Union,
  which we will be happy to make available to you on request.
5.3

We offer you the option of adding the products you have selected to
the shopping cart directly in the app. You will then be automatically forwarded
to our web shop.  If you are already registered in the app, your

the checkout and conveniently complete your purchase.
You can find more data protection information about our shop here:
5.4
Newsletter
In order
to
be able to receive our newsletter regularly, we need at least your
e-mail address to which the newsletter is to be sent, in addition to your data
protection consent. For this we use the e-mail address that you gave us during
the registration process. The so-called double opt-in procedure is used for
registration,
i.e.
we will only send you the
newsletter if you have previously confirmed your registration via the link
contained in a confirmation e-mail sent to you for this purpose. We want to
ensure that only you as the owner of the e-mail address provided can register
for the newsletter.
If you
have subscribed to our newsletter, we reserve the right to also use selected
data via an external newsletter service provider to send the newsletter.
Details:
If you subscribe to
  our newsletter, your e-mail address will be sent to EMARSYS (further
  information such as name or other personal data will not be requested).
For the compilation
  of our individual e-mail newsletter, we use the analysis tool
Emarsys
Predict, which evaluates your use of the
  newsletter as well as our app and the shop.
In addition, our
  newsletters may contain hyperlinks (“links”) containing random but unique
  identification numbers. We may collect and store these identification numbers
  when you access these links to retrieve additional information from our
  servers.
We use this
  information about the calls you make to understand your use of our newsletter
  and our app and website, to measure the success of certain marketing measures
  and to adapt our offers to your individual interests and needs.
Storage period:
The data you have stored with us for the purpose of subscribing
  to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the
  newsletter and will be deleted after you have canceled the newsletter.
Legal basis:
The legal basis for processing the data after registering for the
  newsletter is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke your consent
  at any time.
If we receive your e-mail address in connection with the sale of
  goods or services and you have not objected to this, we reserve the right to
  regularly send you offers by e-mail for similar products to those already
  purchased
on the basis of
Section 7 (3) UWG from our
  range. This serves to safeguard our overriding legitimate interests in
  advertising to our customers within the framework of a balancing of
  interests.
You can object to this use of your e-mail address at any time by
  sending a message to the contact option described in this Privacy Policy or
  via a link provided for this purpose in the advertising e-mail.

  cannot be ruled out. For the exceptional cases in which your data is
  transmitted to the US or other countries outside the EU
( e.g.

  protection guarantees. These are the standard contractual clauses of the
  European Union, which we will be happy to make available to you on request.
