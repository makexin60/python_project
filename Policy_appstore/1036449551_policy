SDKs
What are SDKs?
SDK stands for “Software Development Kit”. These are collections of software development tools that We use to provide products and services to You. Some SDKs are required for App software development. For example, the iOS SDK is required for any iOS Application. One SDK that our Android and iOS Applications both use is the Firebase Analytics SDK. This allows for Us to track App performance metrics and usage. This data is anonymized and provides guidance on what to improve in future App Versions. Privacy policies and contact information for third parties that place SDKs via the Discogs App can be found in Our
Processors List
.
SDKs have different lifespans:
Persistent: these files remember certain information about Your preferences for viewing mobile apps, and allows the mobile app manager to recognise You each time You return. These are stored on Your mobile device until You choose to delete them.
Session: these files are specific to a particular visit to a mobile app that carry information as You view different pages on a mobile app so You don’t have to re-enter information.
How We Use SDKs
Our SDKs: We use Our mobile app specific SDKs to uniquely identify You after You access Our Service. Upon successfully logging in, Our server will generate a unique and random token. A copy of the token is saved on Our server, and a copy is sent to Your mobile app as a login token. Your mobile device sends this token back to Our server each time it requests a resource from Our server, such as a new page to which You are navigating. Our servers then look up Your secure profile using this token.
Our SDKs are required to enable certain features that relate to Your personal account. These include:
Buying & Selling
Adding items to a Wantlist or Collection
Making Lists
Participating in Forums
Saving preferences
Submitting to the Database
Messaging other users
Social Sharing Your Collection or Wantlist
We also use Our own domain specific SDKs to assist with:
Login information (note: the SDK stores a unique value that identifies You after You log in, but does not store Your actual login information such as username and password)
Buying and selling preferences
General device and application setting preferences, such as language, login status and shopping cart details
User interaction and behavior analytics
Service security
Third-party SDKs: Our mobile applications use third-party SDKs to anonymously track mobile usage and analytics, such as: Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
Many third-party SDKs are not essential to user experience on Our Service other than collecting data on how We can improve Our Service based on anonymous browsing behaviors.
We also partner with others, who may use various tracking technologies to provide certain services or features, including cross-device tracking, which allows us to recognize users across multiple devices or browsers.
Please see Our
Processors List
for additional information about parties that use tracking technologies on Our Service.
Some of these parties may provide Us with information about You (such as inferred demographic information, cross-device information, or interest categories) so that We may improve Our Service.
We do not allow third parties to access personally identifiable information from Us via SDKs or any other tracking technology. However, these technologies may allow Us or a third party to recognize You, either across devices or over time. We do not have control over third-party technologies, which maintain their own privacy policies, and they are not covered by Our
Privacy Policy
or this Policy.
Current SDKs
The below link provides detailed information about the SDKs available through our Discogs App. This list will change from time to time, so please check back often for updates. In addition, third parties not associated with us may also place SDKs on Your mobile device from time to time.

Your Personal Information Rights
Identity Verification and Authorized Agents
If You submit a request to exercise Your rights under any privacy or data protection law and regulation, We will need to verify Your identity prior to complying with Your request. We verify requests by confirming the email address that sent the request is attached to a registered account on Our system. Erasure/Deletion requests include a second verification from the user sending the request. If You do not have an account with Us the only data We collect and process is (i) made available via SDKs as allowed by law or regulation, which You can manage via Your “SDK Settings” or “Manage Preferences” link on the Service in applicable jurisdictions, or (ii) any email address and country (as applicable) that You provide when signing up for Our email subscriptions and You may unsubscribe via the email links at any time.
Your authorized agent may be able to make a request to exercise Your rights on Your behalf. Please contact Us at privacy [at] discogs [dot] com to do so.
Consent
Where You have provided Your consent to any part of the Service, You may withdraw that consent at any time. To withdraw Your consent to Our policies in their entirety, You must cease using the Service.  You may also withdraw Your consent to certain processing activities within the Service within Your account settings. Finally, You may withdraw Your consent to marketing-related email using the “unsubscribe” button found in those emails and, in some cases, within Your account settings.
Automated Decision Making
If You complete the “seller settings” within Your account, indicating a desire to sell through Our Service, You will undergo an automated assessment of Your email address to verify its validity. Such assessment amounts to email address profiling and will result in an automated decision regarding Your ability to sell through Our Service. The assessment results in a risk rating of the email address and higher risk email addresses may not be granted the ability to sell through Our Service. In addition, as part of Our seller verification process, We may conduct facial cross-checks of identity cards, and photos or video selfies, uploaded by You to our identity verification provider’s platform. This process is completed solely through automated means and results in profiling. Both of these assessments could impact You financially if You are not eligible to sell through Our Service as a result. We do not otherwise participate in any automated decision making.
You have the right to obtain human intervention, express your point of view and contest the outcome of these assessments by contacting Us at privacy [at] discogs [dot] com.
Access
You have a right to access Your personal information that We collect/process/store or personal information that We “sell” or "share". Personal Data We “sell” or "share" (as defined by various U.S. State privacy laws and regulations) is limited to information generated by SDKs related to analytics.
Other than Your IP address, geolocation, SSID, device information and operating system (collected when You access the Service), information collected via SDKs (with Your consent, as applicable), and information that You provide to Us in Your support requests, all personal information We collect from registered users can be found in Your user profile by reviewing Your
User Profile Settings
and the additional settings noted in the menu on the left side of the page (i.e., Notification, Privacy, Buyer, Seller, etc.).
In addition,
We offer email subscription services available to both registered and non-registered users that collect only an email address provided directly by the user.
For those jurisdictions where We provide a SDK banner, SDK settings specific to Your device can be viewed via the “Settings,” “Manage Preferences,”
or “Manage Privacy”
links located on Our Service.

General
Last Updated: September 30, 2024
Below please find important information for California consumers (“You” or “Your”) related to the services provided by Zink Media, LLC (d/b/a Discogs) and our affiliates (“We”, “Our” “Us” or “Discogs”) pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq., as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and its implementing regulations (the “CCPA”). This notice applies to the personal information We collect on Our mobile applications (the “Service”).
Additional information about Our mobile applications privacy practices is detailed in Our
Discogs App Privacy Policy
. You can contact Us about Our Discogs App Privacy Policy and Our practices via Our
Help Center
or at privacy [at] discogs [dot] com.
Right to Know About Personal Information Collected
We collect certain categories of information about You when You visit or use Our Service. The list of categories, including the business or commercial purpose, and additional disclosure information is set forth in the “Information Collected” and “Information Sharing and Disclosure” sections of Our
Discogs App Privacy Policy
.
Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information/Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale Or Sharing of Personal Information
By default, only strictly necessary SDKs are placed on California site visitor devices until the visitor actively opts into additional SDK types.
If You take no action on the SDK banner, all SDKs (except for strictly necessary SDKs) will continue to be blocked.
If You select “Accept SDKs” in the SDK banner, (i) strictly necessary SDKs will still be placed, (ii) You explicitly consent to the placement of functional SDKs and (iii) You explicitly consent to targeting and performance being placed on Our Service by third parties for other valuable consideration for the purpose of (a) targeting for collecting data for email, onsite and in-app messages, and coordinating data across marketing channels, and (b) analytics for Service performance reviews and improvements. Targeting SDK providers may use information from SDKs, such as Your non-precise geolocation and inferred interests based on Your browsing behavior to serve You personalized messages. We do not otherwise “sell” or "share" (as defined by the California Privacy Rights Act) any personal information. We only share Your personal information with others for the limited purpose of providing the Service to You.
If You click “Accept SDKs” and subsequently click “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”, (i) this has the effect of placing strictly necessary SDKs and functional SDKs on your device for website functionalities (functional SDKs), but (ii) prevents Our Services from sharing or selling Your personal information from SDKs with third parties for the purpose of targeting and analytics.
Since the SDK consent actions must be performed by a person using Your device, We do not conduct any identity verification with respect to Your exercise of this right. We also honor opt-out preference signals as discussed above under “Opt-out Preference Signals.” You may contact Us at privacy [at] discogs [dot] com for additional information about Your opt out rights. Please see
Discogs App Privacy Policy
for additional information about controlling SDKs.
Right to Know and Right to Delete
You may submit a request for the categories and/or specific information that We have collected about you or a request that We delete any personal information about You that We have collected, subject to certain exceptions. Refer to the “Your Personal Information Rights" section of the Our
Discogs App Privacy Policy
for information on submitting requests regarding your rights.
