Monet AI stores your subscription ID and device ID, and basic subscription information (what you signed up for or cancelled) and counts the number of images you create each day.   This data is never sold or distributed, but rather is used to give better support to our customers.
We do upload your prompt and settings selections for images to Open AI to run the AI process.
Your prompts and images might be stored by Open AI based on their terms of services polices.
