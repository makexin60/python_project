What is UNiDAYS?
UNiDAYS provides student identity verification services and works with brands that want to provide verified students with benefits and/or advertise their products and services to our Members on our platform. We refer to these brands as our “Partners”. Through the Platform, Members have access to exclusive promotions, discounts, and other exciting offers from Partners (“Offers”). Members may also have access to available sweepstakes, competitions, contests, volunteer opportunities, polls, surveys, subscriptions, exclusive content, and other online and in-person opportunities and events. Members also can benefit from the verification status to log on to other 3rd party platforms of Partners via our UConnect services.
To the extent that UNiDAYS and a Partner use the
OAuth 2.0
authorisation protocol embedded in our UConnect services, and you elected to verify your identity and eligibility with UNiDAYS, we, with your express consent when required, will share certain personal data with the Partner for the specific purposes of verifying your identity and eligibility to receive Partner Offers and/or enable you to log in on a 3rd party Partner’s platform using UNiDAYS credentials:
What information does UNiDAYS collect and why?
If you are resident in the United States of America, please see our US State Privacy Notice available
here
.
We collect information from or about Members so that we verify identity and curate Offers and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Of course, we also collect information when we are required to do so by applicable laws.
We collect four main categories of personal data:
Personal data that you provide to UNiDAYS
Automatically-collected Personal Data
Data from third parties
Data related to targeted advertising
Personal data that you provide to UNiDAYS
We collect personal data that you provide when you register, verify your identity, or otherwise choose to share with us. We collect this personal data for many reasons, including to create and secure your account, provide our services, and protect the Platform.
A personal email address is required to create a UNiDAYS account and additional academic personal information for student verification status: an academic email address, and/or Student ID Card, and/or University/College/Academic Institution supporting documents (depending on the verification flow of your choice such as the Portal). All other personal data collected through the account or use of the Platform may include:
First and last Name;
University/College/Academic Institution;
Enrolment Status;
Country of residence;
Social media username;
Telephone number;
Date of Birth and Age;
TGender;
Photographs of yourself, such as on your Student ID or when you allow UNiDAYS to access your photos through the App;
Customer service communications;
Preferences, opinions, and other details about yourself that you choose to share in your responses to surveys or during focus groups or discussions; and
Personal data shared with other Members through the Platform.
We collect these personal data for the following purposes:
To verify identity and eligibility for membership;
To create Members’ accounts;
To send information about Offers that we think will interest Members, including Offers that are personalised based on the information associated with that Member’s account;
To administer sweepstakes (also known as giveaways), contests, polls, surveys, and events in which Members choose to participate;
To respond to correspondence and requests, such as Member interactions with our Customer Service team;
To learn how Members interact with the Platform so that we can improve the Platform, develop new features, and identify which Partners’ Offers are most popular with Members;
To process a Member’s application to become a UNiDAYS blogger, influencer, or other content creator;
To present volunteer and internship opportunities for Members;
To obtain feedback and provide customer service about Offers, Partners, and the Platform in general;
To detect and protect against spam, fraud, or unauthorised use of the Platform; and
To monitor and enforce compliance with our legal agreements.
Automatically-collected Personal Data
Both us and our contractors and vendors automatically collect personal data related to your use of the Platform. This information includes:
Device Information: When you interact with the Platform, we collect technical information about your computer or mobile device including your IP or MAC address, device make, model and operating system, mobile network information, internet service provider, unique device identification number, advertising ID, browser type and language, geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location or time zone);
Online Activity and Browsing Information: We use cookies, pixel tags, software development kits (“SDKs”) and other tracking technologies to automatically collect information about your interaction with the Platform. This information includes log-in events (i.e., when you log into and for how long you use the Platform),"click stream" data, which are data about how your computer or mobile device interacts with the Platform e.g. interactions with offers, polls, surveys and other content on the Platform. The use of cookies, pixel tags, software development kits (“SDKs”) and other tracking technologies are subject to your explicit consent and more information can be found in our
Cookie Policy
.
Transactional Information: When you access Offers through the Platform, we collect details of the specific offer and the date and time that it was accessed.
Automatically-collected data help us understand how Members and visitors who are not Members use the Platform. Specifically, we use automatically-collected data:
To personalise and target our advertising through our online advertising partners, including social media platforms;
For analytics to enhance how Members use the Platform or a device;
To evaluate the performance of Offers and other content, such as which Partners and types of Offers are most popular;
To improve the quality and relevance of the Platform for Members, such as by showing or offering Members Platform content based on their preferences inferred from clickstream data (with consent where necessary);
To present Offers and information that we believe are tailored to the interests of particular categories of Members;
To help resolve technical issues and develop and update the Platform;
To detect unauthorised use of the Platform and/or distribution of Platform content;
For customer service; and
For billing purposes, so that we can bill our Partners for the services that we provide.
Data from third parties
We may receive personal data from third parties when you interact with Offers. We use this personal data to analyse and improve the Platform, provide our services, personalise your experience and carry out our business.
From time to time, we may receive personal data about you from Partners and other third-party data sources (including publicly available sources). We receive transactional data about your interactions with a Partner’s website or app when you click through an Offer to make a purchase. We use this data for billing purposes so that we can bill our Partners for the services that we provide. The data we receive from third parties also are used to learn more about our Members, to tailor Members’ experiences on the Platform, to recommend Partners and Offers that we think will interest particular Members, and to improve the quality of the Platform content. These data also help us to monitor and analyse trends and Platform use so that we can better manage our technology infrastructure and detect and protect against fraud or unauthorised use of the Platform.
If you  click through to UNiDAYS from a link on social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, Reddit, TikTok and Snapchat, the social media site will share information with us about the way our Platform is being used. This is aggregate information and cannot be used to identify you. For example, these statistics may tell us the age ranges of our visitors and whether they are male or female. Our
Cookie Policy
has more information about how you can control this.
When we combine data from third-party data sources to enhance the data that we hold about you, we require that each third-party data source confirm that its sharing of personal data with UNiDAYS is transparent and lawful.
Data related to targeted advertising
We also process your personal data to provide personalised and relevant advertising based on your likes and preferences.
We display and help our Partners display targeted advertising by using personal data collected when Members and visitors interact with the Platform. Targeted ads (also sometimes referred to as personalised or interest-based ads) are displayed based on information generated by your online activity, such as:
any purchases you make through the Platform;
your use of the Platform;
visiting sites that contain Partners’ content, ads, or cookies; and the websites that you visit before and after you log on to the Platform. We also use social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest, Quora, TikTok and Snapchat to advertise.
We, and our Partners, will process personal data about you for the following purposes, linked to targeted advertising, including to:
track user usage and event attendance;
target marketing campaigns specific to our users;
collect information and insights about you when you visit the Platform;
deliver advertisements from third party advertisers; and
determine what advertisements should be shown that may be relevant to you.
You can change your cookie preferences, including targeting cookies (which are used to present you with relevant advertising) on the Platform in your account settings. You will still see ads but they may not be personalised to you.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a browser’s user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including UNiDAYS, do not respond to DNT signals.
For information about how and why we use cookies for targeted advertising, please see our
Cookie Policy
.
How does UNiDAYS share personal data?
We share your personal data with parties (including employees and contractors, where appropriate) that help us provide the Platform and to carry out our business.
We also share your personal information when you give us your consent.
UNiDAYS shares personal data with organisations that help operate the Platform, when we are legally required to do so, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.
We share personal data with the following categories of recipients:
Professional advisors, such as lawyers, accountants, and information security and forensics experts;
Third party companies we partner with for targeted advertising purposes who are deploying cookies and similar technologies on our Platform;
Partners and other Platform advertisers as needed to process orders, payments and to carry out our business;
Marketing vendors that help UNiDAYS promote the Platform and from time to time supplement personal data that we already have. For this purpose we may provide your email address to the social media platforms in hashed form for them to present sponsored posts in your social media feed and to other providers for them to help us develop insights, to match behaviour and to build audiences;
Our contractors and vendors to enable them to work for us, including without limitation those who perform data analytics and test, monitor, secure, and enable the Platform and services. For example:
Iterable receives and uses our data to assist us with marketing email campaigns;
Kevel receives and uses our data to deliver personalised advertising to Members;
Competent law enforcement, government regulators, courts, or other third parties when we believe disclosure is necessary (i) to comply with the law, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect the vital interests of Members, Partners or another third party;
Potential or actual acquirers or investors and their professional advisers in connection with any proposed merger, acquisition, or investment in or of all or any part of our business. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the terms of this Privacy Policy apply to personal data after the transaction or that you receive notice of any changes to your personal data processing;
Our affiliates; and
To any other third party with your permission.

If we process your personal data based on your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the
“How Do I Contact UNiDAYS?”
heading below. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on a lawful basis other than consent.
If we process your personal data based on our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to that processing, subject to certain exceptions, by contacting us using the contact details provided under the
“How Do I Contact UNiDAYS?”
heading below.
When our processing of your personal data results in automated decisions, such as document verification, security monitoring (e.g when to trigger an email notification to you when we do not recognise a log in because it is from a different device or location) or which ads or content to show you, we do not intend that these decisions legally affect or significantly affect you. By automated decision, we mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of computer algorithms without our human review. If we make an automated decision about you that legally affects or otherwise significantly affects you, you have the right to ask us to review the decision and to require a human review of the decision. You can learn about and exercise this right by contacting us using the contact details provided under the

Please know that the rights described above are not automatic rights and may not apply in all circumstances. When this occurs, we will notify you in our response to you.
For your protection, if you are a Member, we only fulfil requests for the personal data associated with the email address in your account and, if you are not a Member, we only fulfil requests for the personal data associated with the email address that you use to send us your request. We may need to request information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access personal data. When we make these requests for more information, we do so as a security measure to ensure that your personal data are not disclosed to someone who has no right to receive your personal data. We also may contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Keeping your personal data – particularly your email addresses – accurate and current is important. Please update your account and/or contact us if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
Please note that we may need to retain certain personal data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete a transaction that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion, such as fulfilling a prize in a sweepstake. Our databases and other records may have residual personal data which we cannot and will not remove. We also may not allow you to review certain personal data for legal, security, or other similar reasons.
Generally, no fee is associated with exercising your privacy rights but UNiDAYS may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

Where does UNiDAYS process personal data?
Generally, we process personal data in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States, depending on the circumstances. We transfer data only as permitted by applicable law.
Your personal data may be transferred to and processed someplace other than where you live. These other jurisdictions may have privacy laws that are different from the laws of where you reside (and, in some cases, not as protective).
Our servers are primarily located in Ireland but we store and replicate your personal data on servers in other places in order to provide speed of access, robustness, and protection against server failure. The other primary jurisdictions where personal data are processed by or on behalf of UNiDAYS are the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
The Partners, vendors, and contractors with whom or which we share personal data as described in this Privacy Policy are located in and transfer personal data to various jurisdictions around the world.
Where your personal data is transferred by us or on our behalf, we use appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. These safeguards include entering into Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data where applicable. We also may require additional safeguards depending on where personal data are transferred. Please contact us using the contact details provided under the
“How Do I Contact UNiDAYS?”
heading below for more information.
When we share personal data with a third party acting as our processor, we do so subject to contractual obligations that require that the processor protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How does UNiDAYS protect personal data?
We take care to secure and safeguard your personal data using various technological measures as required by applicable law.
Like any other organisation, UNiDAYS cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the processing of personal data but UNiDAYS uses technical, physical, and administrative safeguards intended to protect the personal data that we process. Our safeguards are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data and include (as applicable) measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and a procedure for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing of personal data.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. UNiDAYS will treat access to the Platform through your account credentials as authorised by you.
We may suspend your use of all or part of the Platform without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to UNiDAYS or your account is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at
info@myunidays.com
.
If we become aware of a breach that affects the security of your personal data, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law. When permitted by applicable law, UNiDAYS will provide this notice to you through the email address associated with your account.
UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA AND THE PLATFORM – INCLUDING SCRAPING – IS PROHIBITED AND MAY LEAD TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
For how long will UNiDAYS retain personal data?
We only keep personal data as long as permitted by applicable law. We also anonymise certain personal data for our records.
UNiDAYS will only retain your personal data for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements or to protect against fraud). We may retain your personal data for a longer period to address a complaint or if we reasonably believe that litigation in respect to our relationship with you is possible.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process personal data, we will either delete or anonymise that personal data. If you are a Member, UNiDAYS’ policy is to delete or anonymise your personal data three (3) years after your membership terminates.
If we are not able to delete or anonymise certain personal data (for example, because your data are stored in backup archives or due to a legal requirement), then we will securely store the personal data and isolate the data from any further processing until deletion or anonymization is feasible.
We may anonymise personal data for research or statistical purposes, in which case the resulting data are no longer personal data subject to this Privacy Policy and we may use these data without restriction.
Does this Privacy Policy apply to Partners or websites linked to this Platform?
This Privacy Policy applies to the UNiDAYS Platform. When you interact with an Offer or otherwise visit a third party's website or app, those third party's policies and terms will apply.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal data processing by Partners on their own websites or other third-party websites, even when those websites are linked to or from the Platform. The personal data collected through any of these third-party websites are subject to the respective third party’s privacy policy and practices. Your access to all third party websites is at your own risk. We encourage you to review the applicable privacy policy before disclosing personal data to anyone.
When and why does UNiDAYS update this Privacy Policy?
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  You can always find the latest version on our website.
UNiDAYS may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical, or business developments. When we update this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated version and change the “Last Updated” date above. We also will take appropriate measures to inform you so that you have an opportunity to review significant changes to this  Privacy Policy, but please regularly check this Privacy Policy to ensure you are aware of the updated version.
