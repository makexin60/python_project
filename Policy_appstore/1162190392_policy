Introduction
At IBM we value your privacy and are committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly.
This privacy statement describes how IBM collects, uses, and shares personal information about consumers and other individuals within our clients, business partners, supplier and other organizations with which IBM has or contemplates a business relationship. It applies to IBM Corporation and IBM subsidiaries except where a subsidiary presents its own statement without reference to IBM’s.
Where we provide products, services, or applications as a business-to-business provider to a client, the client is responsible for the collection and use of personal information while using these products, services, or applications. This collection and use is covered by the client’s privacy policy, unless otherwise described. Our agreement with the client may allow us to request and collect information about authorized users of these products, services, or applications for reasons of contract management. In this case, this privacy statement, or a supplementary privacy notice, applies.
We may provide additional data privacy information by using a supplementary privacy notice.

The information that we collect and use may include profile information, interactions on webpages, marketing preferences, information to investigate malicious activities, recordings or transcripts of your conversations with us for support purposes, information to improve our business operations, and more.
Your Account
You can create an account with IBM by creating an IBMid. An IBMid provides IBM with your name, email address, mailing address, and related information that you may provide. We may require an IBMid for certain services, such as the use of
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
We may also store your details from business contact information that you provide to us, or that we collect from your organization, our Business Partners, or our suppliers.
An IBMid uniquely identifies you when you access our websites, make a request or order, or use a product or service. If you log into our websites with an IBMid we may link the information we collect with your account. An IBMid is also used to give you access to
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
and allows you to manage your contract and billing history. The email address in your IBMid may be used to contact you in relation to any services to which you subscribe.
Business contact information is typically information that you would find on a business card, such as name and business contact details. We use this information to contact or communicate with you about business matters. If we receive business contact information from a third party, such as an IBM Business Partner or supplier, we will confirm that the information was shared appropriately.
We may also combine your business contact information with other business-relevant information, such as information about your professional education, skills, work experience, or other publicly available information, such as business-related blogs, publications, job roles, and certifications. This information may be used to tailor our interactions with you in any part of IBM’s business, for example in the sales process, to maintain a relationship with you, and for post-contractual relationships.
If your account is created by using an email address containing a domain owned by an organization which you are employed by, contracted to, or volunteer for, your organization can:
inquire about the status of your account,
request your account settings (including your personal information), and,
at its option, convert it to an enterprise ID.
If your account was created as, or is converted to, an enterprise ID, your organization manages your account information. It is also the authenticating agency for your ID, meaning your access is controlled by your organization’s login service.
If your IBMid is created through an Enterprise Federation Partner (Identity Provider), basic personal information is collected from the Identity Partner and shared with IBM.
IBM Websites
Our websites offer ways to communicate with you about us, our products, and services. The information that we collect on websites is used to provide you with access to the website, to operate the website, to improve your experience, and to personalize the way that information is provided to you.

Aggregate the information that is collected about IBM website visitors for the purposes of developing and modelling marketing audiences.
Contractual Relationships
A contractual relationship is created when you order a trial, or a product or service from us. While we mainly provide our products and services to businesses, individuals may also enter into an agreement with us directly as a client. We may collect any information that is reasonably necessary to prepare for, enter, and fulfill, the contractual agreement.
The information collected in a contractual relationship may include the business contact information of the requester, an IBMid, and the order details. Information that is required for shipment and payment, for the implementation of services, or to grant access to the product or service may also be collected.
This information may be collected for various purposes, depending on the nature of the products or services, for example, for contractual management and compliance, to provide support, for the improvement or development of our products and services, to contact you for customer satisfaction surveys, and to generate technical and market insights. For more information, see
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
The information collected in a contractual relationship is not used for the purposes of marketing and advertising without obtaining consent before processing.
Support Services
When you contact us to request support, including through LiveChat, we collect your contact information, problem description, and possible resolutions. We record the information that is provided to handle the support query, for administrative purposes, to foster our relationship with you, for staff training, and for quality assurance purposes.
The information that we collect may include any information exchanged during our phone conversations or provided during Live Chat support sessions on our websites. This may include a recording or transcript of your conversations with us. We may use this information to inform you of products or services that are related to your support request. This can include product updates or fixes, and we may combine the information that is collected through other interactions with you or your organization to provide more valuable suggestions in relation to product support, such as any available training regarding the issue.
While we handle the support case, we may have incidental access to information that you have provided or information that is on your system. This information may contain information about you, your organization's employees, customers, or other relevant parties. The conditions regarding the handling and processing of this information is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between your organization and IBM, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.
Protecting You and IBM
We may collect and use information to protect you and IBM from IT security threats and to secure the information that we hold from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes information from our IT access authorization systems, such as log-in information.
The security solutions we use to protect your information, our infrastructure, and our networks may collect information such as IP addresses and log files. This is necessary for the functionality and utility of security programs to enable the investigation of any potential security incidents and generate insights on security threats.
We may use specialized tooling and other technical means to collect information at access points to, and in, IT systems and networks to detect unauthorized access, viruses, and indications of malicious activities. The information we collect may be used to conduct investigations when unauthorized access, malware or malicious activities are suspected, and to remove or isolate malicious code or content.
IBM Locations
When you visit an IBM location, we collect your name or business contact information (see
Your Account
), and, in some cases, information from a government issued ID. This information is collected for access management and to protect the security and safety of our locations and employees.
The information that is collected at our locations is used to issue access badges. We may verify the identity of visitors where legally permissible and, for supplier personnel working on site, a badge with a photo identification may be requested for identification purposes.
Camera supervision and access management are used for reasons of security and safety of our locations, employees, and assets. More information may be available at the IBM location.
Recruitment and Former Employees
We are constantly searching for new talent for our organization, and we collect information about job applicants or prospective candidates from several sources. Applicants are referred to the
Talent Acquisition Privacy Notice
for more information. When an employee leaves IBM, we continue to process information that is related to them for any remaining business, contractual, employment, legal, and fiscal purposes, including the management of pensions to the extent handled by IBM.
Regarding recruitment, we may look for prospective candidates with the help of recruitment intermediaries and may use publicly available information on social media platforms to identify prospective candidates for a specific function.
When an employee leaves IBM, we retain basic information from the former employee about their employment at IBM.
After an employee retires, we process information about the retiree for fulfilling the pension obligations toward the retiree. Information about the processing of pension information, or other retirement programs, can be found with the local organization responsible for pensions. In some countries, this may be an independent organization. In some cases, retirees may still participate in IBM-organized initiatives or programs, such as volunteer and social responsibility programs. Such participation is voluntary, and more information is provided on the relevant websites or information pages for those initiatives.
Conducting our Business Operations
We collect and use information to improve our business operations, systems, and processes. For example, information may be used to conduct, maintain, audit, and optimize our operations, to protect our assets and employees, for product development, and to defend our rights.
We collect information about our business operations to make informed decisions about the organization, the business, and to report on performance, audits, and trends. For example, we use this information to analyze the costs and quality of our operations. Where possible, this is done by using aggregated information, but may use personal information.
We collect and use information from our business systems, which may include personal information, to:
protect or enforce our rights, including to detect fraud or other criminal activities (for example, by using information in payment systems)
handle and resolve disputes
answer complaints and defend IBM in legal proceedings
and comply with legal obligations in the countries where we do business
We collect information from the use of our business processes, websites, cloud and online services, products, or technologies. This information may include personal information and is used for product and process development. For example, we may use this information to increase efficiency, decrease costs, or improve services by developing automated processes and tools, or to develop or improve the technologies on which these are based.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
When you visit our websites, cloud and online services, software products, or view our content on certain third-party websites, we collect information regarding your connection and your activity by using various online tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, Local Storage, or HTML5. Information that is collected with these technologies may be necessary to operate the website or service, to improve performance, to help us understand how our online services are used, or to determine the interests of our users. We use advertising partners to provide and assist in the use of such technologies on IBM and other sites.
A cookie is a piece of data that a website may send to your browser, which may be stored on your computer and can be used to identify your computer. Web beacons, including pixels and tags, are technologies that are used to track a user visiting an IBM web page or if a web page was copied to another website. Local Shared Objects can store content information displayed on the webpage visited, and preferences. All of these technologies may be used to provide connected features across our websites or display targeted IBM advertising (subject to your cookie preferences) on other websites based on your interests. Web beacons may also be used to track your interaction with email messages or newsletters, such as to determine whether messages are opened or links are selected.
Session cookies can be used to track your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information that you have already provided during the current session, or information that is needed to be able to complete a transaction. Session cookies are erased when the web browser is closed.
Persistent cookies issued by IBM expire every 14 months. IBM allows cookies issued by vendors on its websites. For cookies issued by vendors, persistent cookie retention periods are covered by the vendor's privacy policy.

Blocking, disabling, or rejecting IBM cookies may cause services to not function properly, such as in connection with a shopping cart, or block the use of websites or IBM Cloud services that require you to sign in. Disabling cookies does not disable other online tracking technologies, but prevents the other technologies from accessing any details stored in cookies.
Our websites offer the possibility to use third-party social media options.  If you elect to use these options, these third-party sites may log information about you, such as your IP address, access time, and referring website URLs. If you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link collected information with your profile information.

Sharing Personal Information
We may share your personal information internally and externally with suppliers, advisors, or Business Partners for IBM’s legitimate business purposes, and only on a need-to-know basis. This section describes how we share information and how we facilitate that sharing.
How We Share Personal Information
When sharing personal information, we implement appropriate checks and controls to confirm that the information can be shared in accordance with the applicable law.
If we decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve disclosing some personal information to prospective or actual business purchasers, or the collection of personal information from those selling such businesses.
Internally, personal information is shared for our business purposes: to improve efficiency, for cost savings, and internal collaboration between our subsidiaries (such as Red Hat). For example, we may share personal information such as managing our relationship with you and other external parties, compliance programs, or systems and networks security.
Our internal access to personal information is restricted and granted only on a need-to-know basis. Sharing of this information is subject to the appropriate intracompany arrangements, our policies, and security standards. For more information, see
Legal Basis
.
Externally,
our business with suppliers may include the collection, use, analysis, or other types of processing of personal information on our behalf.
our business model includes cooperation with independent Business Partners for marketing, selling, and the provision of IBM products and services. Where appropriate (for example, when necessary for the fulfilment of an order), we share business contact information with selected Business Partners.
we may share personal information with professional advisors, including lawyers, auditors, and insurance companies to receive their services.
we may share contractual relationship information with others, for instance, our Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal, or government authorities, such as the customs authorities that are involved in fulfillment.
We may share personal information with third parties, such as advertising technology partners, data analytics providers and social networks engaged by IBM to deliver targeted IBM advertisements on their platforms, to aggregate information for analysis, and to track engagement with those advertisements.
In certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies in accordance with judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal processes. We may also share personal information to protect the rights of IBM or others when IBM believes that such rights may be affected, for example to prevent fraud.
Facilitating International Transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to or accessed by IBM subsidiaries and third parties globally. IBM complies with laws on the transfer of personal information between countries to keep your personal information protected, wherever it may be.
We have implemented various safeguards including:
Contractual Clauses, such as those approved by the EU Commission and accepted in several other countries. You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (EU SCCs) by selecting
Contact Us
in the header of this page.
Data Privacy Framework Certification. Where applicable, certain designated IBM services (for example, IBM Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, and select other hosted offerings) are certified to comply with the Data Privacy Framework. For more information, see
IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services
.
Binding Corporate Rules for Controllers (IBM BCR-C). We have BCR-C approved by the European Data Protection Authorities and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. For more information, see
IBM Controller Binding Corporate Rules
.
IBM's privacy practices, described in this Privacy Statement, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules Framework. The
APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules
(CBPR) system provides protection of personal information that is transferred among participating
APEC economies
as it pertains to online information collected through ibm.com.
Controller and Representative Information
IBM does business through its subsidiaries worldwide. The privacy laws in some countries consider a Controller to be the legal entity (or natural person) who defines the purposes for which the processing of personal information takes place and how that information is processed. Parties that are involved in processing operations on behalf of a Controller may be designated as Processors. Designations and associated obligations differ, depending on the jurisdiction.
Where this is relevant for the privacy laws in your country, the Controller of your personal information is IBM’s main subsidiary in your country or region, unless International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp.) or another IBM subsidiary identifies itself as the Controller for a specific interaction with you.
The contact details of our main subsidiary of a country or region can be found by selecting your country or region and selecting Contact on the footer of ibm.com websites. IBM Corp. can be contacted at: International Business Machines Corporation, 1, North Castle Drive, Armonk, New York, United States of America.
Where IBM Corp. or a subsidiary it controls is required to appoint a legal representative, the following representatives have been appointed.
IBM International Group B.V.,
Johan Huizingalaan 765,
1066 VH Amsterdam,
The Netherlands
IBM United Kingdom Limited,
PO Box 41, North Harbour,
Portsmouth,
Hampshire, PO6 3AU,
United Kingdom
Information Security and Retention
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, we implement reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards. These safeguards include role-based access controls and encryption to keep personal information private while in transit. We also require our Business Partners, suppliers, and third parties to implement appropriate safeguards, such as contract terms and access restrictions, to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
IBM makes artificial intelligence models and systems available, including large language models (often called LLMs). IBM may use such AI models and systems on or embedded in IBM.com properties, including through chatbots. IBM may also make such AI models and systems available under separate terms.
IBM’s AI models and systems are designed, trained, validated, and tested on data from publicly available sources that may incidentally contain Personal Information. We have implemented safeguards, processes, and tools to mitigate associated impacts and help address responsible development and deployment of trustworthy AI.
We only retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, or to comply with legal and regulatory retention requirements. Legal and regulatory retention requirements may include retaining information for:
audit and accounting purposes,
statutory retention terms,
the handling of disputes,
and the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.
We retain any contractual relationship information for administrative purposes, legal and regulatory retention requirements, defending IBM rights, and to manage IBM's relationship with you. The information that is provided in a supplementary privacy notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.
When personal information is no longer needed, we have processes in place to securely delete it, for example by erasing electronic files and shredding physical records.

Legal Basis
In some jurisdictions, the lawful handling of personal information is subject to a justification, sometimes referred to as legal basis. The legal bases that we rely on for the lawful handling of your personal information vary depending on the purpose and applicable law.
The different legal bases that we may use are:
We rely on this legal basis when we need to process certain personal information, such as your contact details, payment details, and shipment details, to perform our obligations or to manage our
contractual relationship

Introduction
At IBM we value your privacy and are committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly.
This privacy statement describes how IBM collects, uses, and shares personal information about consumers and other individuals within our clients, business partners, supplier and other organizations with which IBM has or contemplates a business relationship. It applies to IBM Corporation and IBM subsidiaries except where a subsidiary presents its own statement without reference to IBM’s.
Where we provide products, services, or applications as a business-to-business provider to a client, the client is responsible for the collection and use of personal information while using these products, services, or applications. This collection and use is covered by the client’s privacy policy, unless otherwise described. Our agreement with the client may allow us to request and collect information about authorized users of these products, services, or applications for reasons of contract management. In this case, this privacy statement, or a supplementary privacy notice, applies.
We may provide additional data privacy information by using a supplementary privacy notice.
Personal Information We Collect and Use
This section describes the various types of information that we collect and how we use it.
It includes information on
Your Account
,
IBM Websites
,
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
,
Marketing
,
Contractual Relationships
,
Support Services
,
Protecting You and IBM
,
IBM Locations

The information that we collect and use may include profile information, interactions on webpages, marketing preferences, information to investigate malicious activities, recordings or transcripts of your conversations with us for support purposes, information to improve our business operations, and more.
Your Account
You can create an account with IBM by creating an IBMid. An IBMid provides IBM with your name, email address, mailing address, and related information that you may provide. We may require an IBMid for certain services, such as the use of
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
We may also store your details from business contact information that you provide to us, or that we collect from your organization, our Business Partners, or our suppliers.
An IBMid uniquely identifies you when you access our websites, make a request or order, or use a product or service. If you log into our websites with an IBMid we may link the information we collect with your account. An IBMid is also used to give you access to
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
and allows you to manage your contract and billing history. The email address in your IBMid may be used to contact you in relation to any services to which you subscribe.
Business contact information is typically information that you would find on a business card, such as name and business contact details. We use this information to contact or communicate with you about business matters. If we receive business contact information from a third party, such as an IBM Business Partner or supplier, we will confirm that the information was shared appropriately.
We may also combine your business contact information with other business-relevant information, such as information about your professional education, skills, work experience, or other publicly available information, such as business-related blogs, publications, job roles, and certifications. This information may be used to tailor our interactions with you in any part of IBM’s business, for example in the sales process, to maintain a relationship with you, and for post-contractual relationships.
If your account is created by using an email address containing a domain owned by an organization which you are employed by, contracted to, or volunteer for, your organization can:
inquire about the status of your account,
request your account settings (including your personal information), and,
at its option, convert it to an enterprise ID.
If your account was created as, or is converted to, an enterprise ID, your organization manages your account information. It is also the authenticating agency for your ID, meaning your access is controlled by your organization’s login service.
If your IBMid is created through an Enterprise Federation Partner (Identity Provider), basic personal information is collected from the Identity Partner and shared with IBM.
IBM Websites
Our websites offer ways to communicate with you about us, our products, and services. The information that we collect on websites is used to provide you with access to the website, to operate the website, to improve your experience, and to personalize the way that information is provided to you.

Unique User-IDs are used to connect to servers and to connect the use of the device across apps. Depending on the functions of the app, you can tailor your privacy settings by using the settings menu or in your user profile.
IBM Learning offers education services and collects information on course completions to be able to provide you with credentials, certificates, or further information when needed.
We accept no responsibility for the content provided on, or privacy practices, of third-party websites or applications.

Aggregate the information that is collected about IBM website visitors for the purposes of developing and modelling marketing audiences.
Contractual Relationships
A contractual relationship is created when you order a trial, or a product or service from us. While we mainly provide our products and services to businesses, individuals may also enter into an agreement with us directly as a client. We may collect any information that is reasonably necessary to prepare for, enter, and fulfill, the contractual agreement.
The information collected in a contractual relationship may include the business contact information of the requester, an IBMid, and the order details. Information that is required for shipment and payment, for the implementation of services, or to grant access to the product or service may also be collected.
This information may be collected for various purposes, depending on the nature of the products or services, for example, for contractual management and compliance, to provide support, for the improvement or development of our products and services, to contact you for customer satisfaction surveys, and to generate technical and market insights. For more information, see
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
The information collected in a contractual relationship is not used for the purposes of marketing and advertising without obtaining consent before processing.
Support Services
When you contact us to request support, including through LiveChat, we collect your contact information, problem description, and possible resolutions. We record the information that is provided to handle the support query, for administrative purposes, to foster our relationship with you, for staff training, and for quality assurance purposes.
The information that we collect may include any information exchanged during our phone conversations or provided during Live Chat support sessions on our websites. This may include a recording or transcript of your conversations with us. We may use this information to inform you of products or services that are related to your support request. This can include product updates or fixes, and we may combine the information that is collected through other interactions with you or your organization to provide more valuable suggestions in relation to product support, such as any available training regarding the issue.
While we handle the support case, we may have incidental access to information that you have provided or information that is on your system. This information may contain information about you, your organization's employees, customers, or other relevant parties. The conditions regarding the handling and processing of this information is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between your organization and IBM, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.
Protecting You and IBM
We may collect and use information to protect you and IBM from IT security threats and to secure the information that we hold from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes information from our IT access authorization systems, such as log-in information.
The security solutions we use to protect your information, our infrastructure, and our networks may collect information such as IP addresses and log files. This is necessary for the functionality and utility of security programs to enable the investigation of any potential security incidents and generate insights on security threats.
We may use specialized tooling and other technical means to collect information at access points to, and in, IT systems and networks to detect unauthorized access, viruses, and indications of malicious activities. The information we collect may be used to conduct investigations when unauthorized access, malware or malicious activities are suspected, and to remove or isolate malicious code or content.
IBM Locations
When you visit an IBM location, we collect your name or business contact information (see
Your Account
), and, in some cases, information from a government issued ID. This information is collected for access management and to protect the security and safety of our locations and employees.
The information that is collected at our locations is used to issue access badges. We may verify the identity of visitors where legally permissible and, for supplier personnel working on site, a badge with a photo identification may be requested for identification purposes.
Camera supervision and access management are used for reasons of security and safety of our locations, employees, and assets. More information may be available at the IBM location.
Recruitment and Former Employees
We are constantly searching for new talent for our organization, and we collect information about job applicants or prospective candidates from several sources. Applicants are referred to the
Talent Acquisition Privacy Notice
for more information. When an employee leaves IBM, we continue to process information that is related to them for any remaining business, contractual, employment, legal, and fiscal purposes, including the management of pensions to the extent handled by IBM.
Regarding recruitment, we may look for prospective candidates with the help of recruitment intermediaries and may use publicly available information on social media platforms to identify prospective candidates for a specific function.
When an employee leaves IBM, we retain basic information from the former employee about their employment at IBM.
After an employee retires, we process information about the retiree for fulfilling the pension obligations toward the retiree. Information about the processing of pension information, or other retirement programs, can be found with the local organization responsible for pensions. In some countries, this may be an independent organization. In some cases, retirees may still participate in IBM-organized initiatives or programs, such as volunteer and social responsibility programs. Such participation is voluntary, and more information is provided on the relevant websites or information pages for those initiatives.
Conducting our Business Operations
We collect and use information to improve our business operations, systems, and processes. For example, information may be used to conduct, maintain, audit, and optimize our operations, to protect our assets and employees, for product development, and to defend our rights.
We collect information about our business operations to make informed decisions about the organization, the business, and to report on performance, audits, and trends. For example, we use this information to analyze the costs and quality of our operations. Where possible, this is done by using aggregated information, but may use personal information.
We collect and use information from our business systems, which may include personal information, to:
protect or enforce our rights, including to detect fraud or other criminal activities (for example, by using information in payment systems)
handle and resolve disputes
answer complaints and defend IBM in legal proceedings
and comply with legal obligations in the countries where we do business
We collect information from the use of our business processes, websites, cloud and online services, products, or technologies.

For example, we may use this information to increase efficiency, decrease costs, or improve services by developing automated processes and tools, or to develop or improve the technologies on which these are based.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
When you visit our websites, cloud and online services, software products, or view our content on certain third-party websites, we collect information regarding your connection and your activity by using various online tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, Local Storage, or HTML5. Information that is collected with these technologies may be necessary to operate the website or service, to improve performance, to help us understand how our online services are used, or to determine the interests of our users. We use advertising partners to provide and assist in the use of such technologies on IBM and other sites.
A cookie is a piece of data that a website may send to your browser, which may be stored on your computer and can be used to identify your computer. Web beacons, including pixels and tags, are technologies that are used to track a user visiting an IBM web page or if a web page was copied to another website. Local Shared Objects can store content information displayed on the webpage visited, and preferences. All of these technologies may be used to provide connected features across our websites or display targeted IBM advertising (subject to your cookie preferences) on other websites based on your interests. Web beacons may also be used to track your interaction with email messages or newsletters, such as to determine whether messages are opened or links are selected.
Session cookies can be used to track your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information that you have already provided during the current session, or information that is needed to be able to complete a transaction. Session cookies are erased when the web browser is closed.
Persistent cookies issued by IBM expire every 14 months. IBM allows cookies issued by vendors on its websites. For cookies issued by vendors, persistent cookie retention periods are covered by the vendor's privacy policy.

Sharing Personal Information
We may share your personal information internally and externally with suppliers, advisors, or Business Partners for IBM’s legitimate business purposes, and only on a need-to-know basis. This section describes how we share information and how we facilitate that sharing.
How We Share Personal Information
When sharing personal information, we implement appropriate checks and controls to confirm that the information can be shared in accordance with the applicable law.
If we decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve disclosing some personal information to prospective or actual business purchasers, or the collection of personal information from those selling such businesses.
Internally, personal information is shared for our business purposes: to improve efficiency, for cost savings, and internal collaboration between our subsidiaries (such as Red Hat). For example, we may share personal information such as managing our relationship with you and other external parties, compliance programs, or systems and networks security.
Our internal access to personal information is restricted and granted only on a need-to-know basis. Sharing of this information is subject to the appropriate intracompany arrangements, our policies, and security standards. For more information, see
Legal Basis
.
Externally,
our business with suppliers may include the collection, use, analysis, or other types of processing of personal information on our behalf.
our business model includes cooperation with independent Business Partners for marketing, selling, and the provision of IBM products and services. Where appropriate (for example, when necessary for the fulfilment of an order), we share business contact information with selected Business Partners.
we may share personal information with professional advisors, including lawyers, auditors, and insurance companies to receive their services.
we may share contractual relationship information with others, for instance, our Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal, or government authorities, such as the customs authorities that are involved in fulfillment.
We may share personal information with third parties, such as advertising technology partners, data analytics providers and social networks engaged by IBM to deliver targeted IBM advertisements on their platforms, to aggregate information for analysis, and to track engagement with those advertisements.
In certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies in accordance with judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal processes. We may also share personal information to protect the rights of IBM or others when IBM believes that such rights may be affected, for example to prevent fraud.
Facilitating International Transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to or accessed by IBM subsidiaries and third parties globally. IBM complies with laws on the transfer of personal information between countries to keep your personal information protected, wherever it may be.
We have implemented various safeguards including:
Contractual Clauses, such as those approved by the EU Commission and accepted in several other countries. You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (EU SCCs) by selecting
Contact Us
in the header of this page.
Data Privacy Framework Certification. Where applicable, certain designated IBM services (for example, IBM Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, and select other hosted offerings) are certified to comply with the Data Privacy Framework. For more information, see
IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services
.
Binding Corporate Rules for Controllers (IBM BCR-C). We have BCR-C approved by the European Data Protection Authorities and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. For more information, see
IBM Controller Binding Corporate Rules
.
IBM's privacy practices, described in this Privacy Statement, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules Framework. The
APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules
(CBPR) system provides protection of personal information that is transferred among participating
APEC economies
as it pertains to online information collected through ibm.com.
Controller and Representative Information
IBM does business through its subsidiaries worldwide. The privacy laws in some countries consider a Controller to be the legal entity (or natural person) who defines the purposes for which the processing of personal information takes place and how that information is processed. Parties that are involved in processing operations on behalf of a Controller may be designated as Processors. Designations and associated obligations differ, depending on the jurisdiction.
Where this is relevant for the privacy laws in your country, the Controller of your personal information is IBM’s main subsidiary in your country or region, unless International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp.) or another IBM subsidiary identifies itself as the Controller for a specific interaction with you.
The contact details of our main subsidiary of a country or region can be found by selecting your country or region and selecting Contact on the footer of ibm.com websites. IBM Corp. can be contacted at: International Business Machines Corporation, 1, North Castle Drive, Armonk, New York, United States of America.
Where IBM Corp. or a subsidiary it controls is required to appoint a legal representative, the following representatives have been appointed.
IBM International Group B.V.,
Johan Huizingalaan 765,
1066 VH Amsterdam,
The Netherlands
IBM United Kingdom Limited,
PO Box 41, North Harbour,
Portsmouth,
Hampshire, PO6 3AU,
United Kingdom
Information Security and Retention
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, we implement reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards. These safeguards include role-based access controls and encryption to keep personal information private while in transit. We also require our Business Partners, suppliers, and third parties to implement appropriate safeguards, such as contract terms and access restrictions, to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
IBM makes artificial intelligence models and systems available, including large language models (often called LLMs). IBM may use such AI models and systems on or embedded in IBM.com properties, including through chatbots. IBM may also make such AI models and systems available under separate terms.
IBM’s AI models and systems are designed, trained, validated, and tested on data from publicly available sources that may incidentally contain Personal Information. We have implemented safeguards, processes, and tools to mitigate associated impacts and help address responsible development and deployment of trustworthy AI.
We only retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, or to comply with legal and regulatory retention requirements. Legal and regulatory retention requirements may include retaining information for:
audit and accounting purposes,
statutory retention terms,
the handling of disputes,
and the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.
We retain any contractual relationship information for administrative purposes, legal and regulatory retention requirements, defending IBM rights, and to manage IBM's relationship with you. The information that is provided in a supplementary privacy notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.
When personal information is no longer needed, we have processes in place to securely delete it, for example by erasing electronic files and shredding physical records.

Legal Basis
In some jurisdictions, the lawful handling of personal information is subject to a justification, sometimes referred to as legal basis. The legal bases that we rely on for the lawful handling of your personal information vary depending on the purpose and applicable law.
The different legal bases that we may use are:
We rely on this legal basis when we need to process certain personal information, such as your contact details, payment details, and shipment details, to perform our obligations or to manage our
contractual relationship

Data Privacy Framework
IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services
IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services
This Policy is effective as of 10 January 2025.
IBM Privacy Statement
Policy
This IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services (Policy) applies to certain designated IBM Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, and other hosted offerings that are Data Privacy Framework certified (Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services). A list of these offerings is provided in the
Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services
section. If an offering is not on this list, it is not covered by this Policy.
As the Data Privacy Framework applies to personal information that is transferred to the United States from those countries whose data protection laws recognize the Data Privacy Framework as a valid mechanism for such cross-border transfers, this Policy only applies to:
Such personal information that is hosted in the United States through Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services; and
Select offerings when the data is hosted outside the United States, but the Cloud Service processing is temporarily directed to a United States data center to enable continued availability and resiliency.
This Policy does not otherwise apply when clients choose to have their offering content hosted in other countries.
IBM’s Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services process content (which can include the personal information of individual users) on behalf of enterprise clients. In this scenario, IBM can direct inquiries from individual users to the enterprise client that oversees the use of their personal information.
IBM complies with the Principles of the (i) EU-US Data Privacy Framework, (ii) the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and (iii) the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Data Privacy Framework), as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information that is transferred to the United States from those countries whose data protection laws recognize the Data Privacy Framework as a valid mechanism for such cross-border transfers. IBM has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles govern.
All personal information that is received from those countries whose data protection laws recognize the Data Privacy Framework as a valid mechanism for such cross-border transfers in connection with Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services is subject to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, which applies to all IBM affiliates that process personal information associated with Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services.
For more information about the Data Privacy Framework Program, or to view the certification applicable to certain IBM Cloud Services, see the
Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program
.
Personal Information: Types and Purpose for Use
The types of personal information that Data Privacy Framework-Certified Cloud Services collect varies based on the type and nature of each offering and is described in its offering documentation or as otherwise provided by IBM. For more information, see
IBM Terms
. IBM uses such personal information as needed to deliver the Cloud Service, along with additional purposes that can be described in the corresponding Transactional Document (TD) or Attachment.
Use of Subprocessors
IBM can use processors and subprocessors (including personnel and resources) in locations worldwide to deliver the Cloud Services. A list of subprocessors is available upon request. If IBM subcontracts the performance of any of the Cloud Services pursuant to any Attachment or TD, IBM is liable to the client for the acts and omissions of IBM subcontractors as if they were the acts or omissions of IBM under the agreement governing the Cloud Services (subject to the limits and exclusions of liability).
Regulatory Authority and Disclosures
IBM is subject to investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States in connection with its Data Privacy Framework program. IBM might also be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Additional Information for End Users
If users have any questions or complaints concerning IBM’s processing of personal information on behalf of an IBM enterprise client, they can contact the enterprise client directly, or by using the
Contact IBM Privacy
webform. Users who want to access the personal information that IBM hosts on behalf of an enterprise client, or to make choices concerning their information, must contact the enterprise client directly.
Dispute Resolution
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, contact our US-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) by using the
TRUSTe Feedback and Resolution System
. In addition, and as described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles, you also have the option of invoking binding arbitration after other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Account Data
Account data, for example all information about IBM’s clients or their users that is provided to or collected by IBM (including through tracking and other technologies, such as cookies), is covered by the
IBM Privacy Statement

Welcome
The APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System
was developed by APEC economies with input and assistance from industry and civil society to build consumer, business and regulator trust in cross border flows of personal information. The APEC CBPR System requires participating businesses to implement data privacy policies consistent with the APEC Privacy Framework. These policies and practices must be assessed as compliant with the program requirements of the APEC CBPR System by an Accountability Agent (an independent APEC CBPR system recognised public or private sector entity) and be enforceable by law.

Introduction
At IBM we value your privacy and are committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly.
This privacy statement describes how IBM collects, uses, and shares personal information about consumers and other individuals within our clients, business partners, supplier and other organizations with which IBM has or contemplates a business relationship. It applies to IBM Corporation and IBM subsidiaries except where a subsidiary presents its own statement without reference to IBM’s.
Where we provide products, services, or applications as a business-to-business provider to a client, the client is responsible for the collection and use of personal information while using these products, services, or applications. This collection and use is covered by the client’s privacy policy, unless otherwise described. Our agreement with the client may allow us to request and collect information about authorized users of these products, services, or applications for reasons of contract management. In this case, this privacy statement, or a supplementary privacy notice, applies.
We may provide additional data privacy information by using a supplementary privacy notice.
Personal Information We Collect and Use
This section describes the various types of information that we collect and how we use it.
It includes information on
Your Account
,
IBM Websites
,
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
,
Marketing
,
Contractual Relationships
,
Support Services
,
Protecting You and IBM
,
IBM Locations
,
Recruitment and Former Employees
,

,
Cookies and Similar Technologies
, and
Children
.
The information that we collect and use may include profile information, interactions on webpages, marketing preferences, information to investigate malicious activities, recordings or transcripts of your conversations with us for support purposes, information to improve our business operations, and more.
Your Account
You can create an account with IBM by creating an IBMid. An IBMid provides IBM with your name, email address, mailing address, and related information that you may provide. We may require an IBMid for certain services, such as the use of
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
We may also store your details from business contact information that you provide to us, or that we collect from your organization, our Business Partners, or our suppliers.
An IBMid uniquely identifies you when you access our websites, make a request or order, or use a product or service. If you log into our websites with an IBMid we may link the information we collect with your account. An IBMid is also used to give you access to
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
and allows you to manage your contract and billing history. The email address in your IBMid may be used to contact you in relation to any services to which you subscribe.
Business contact information is typically information that you would find on a business card, such as name and business contact details. We use this information to contact or communicate with you about business matters. If we receive business contact information from a third party, such as an IBM Business Partner or supplier, we will confirm that the information was shared appropriately.
We may also combine your business contact information with other business-relevant information, such as information about your professional education, skills, work experience, or other publicly available information, such as business-related blogs, publications, job roles, and certifications. This information may be used to tailor our interactions with you in any part of IBM’s business, for example in the sales process, to maintain a relationship with you, and for post-contractual relationships.
If your account is created by using an email address containing a domain owned by an organization which you are employed by, contracted to, or volunteer for, your organization can:
inquire about the status of your account,
request your account settings (including your personal information), and,
at its option, convert it to an enterprise ID.
If your account was created as, or is converted to, an enterprise ID, your organization manages your account information. It is also the authenticating agency for your ID, meaning your access is controlled by your organization’s login service.
If your IBMid is created through an Enterprise Federation Partner (Identity Provider), basic personal information is collected from the Identity Partner and shared with IBM.
IBM Websites
Our websites offer ways to communicate with you about us, our products, and services. The information that we collect on websites is used to provide you with access to the website, to operate the website, to improve your experience, and to personalize the way that information is provided to you.

We accept no responsibility for the content provided on, or privacy practices, of third-party websites or applications.
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
Our cloud and online services include “as-a-service” and desktop applications, mobile applications (or apps), and IBM Learning services. We collect information about the use of these services, such as pages you view or your interactions on that page, to improve and develop our services and to generate technical and market insights. We may require an IBMid for the use of our cloud and online services (see
Your Account

Mobile application privacy notices may provide details about the information that is collected by the app, such as geo-location information or the unique User-ID of a device. Unique User-IDs are used to connect to servers and to connect the use of the device across apps. Depending on the functions of the app, you can tailor your privacy settings by using the settings menu or in your user profile.
IBM Learning offers education services and collects information on course completions to be able to provide you with credentials, certificates, or further information when needed.
We accept no responsibility for the content provided on, or privacy practices, of third-party websites or applications.

Use aggregated data to measure effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and events, and to proceed to informed business decisions and investments,
Aggregate the information that is collected about IBM website visitors for the purposes of developing and modelling marketing audiences.
Contractual Relationships
A contractual relationship is created when you order a trial, or a product or service from us. While we mainly provide our products and services to businesses, individuals may also enter into an agreement with us directly as a client. We may collect any information that is reasonably necessary to prepare for, enter, and fulfill, the contractual agreement.
The information collected in a contractual relationship may include the business contact information of the requester, an IBMid, and the order details. Information that is required for shipment and payment, for the implementation of services, or to grant access to the product or service may also be collected.
This information may be collected for various purposes, depending on the nature of the products or services, for example, for contractual management and compliance, to provide support, for the improvement or development of our products and services, to contact you for customer satisfaction surveys, and to generate technical and market insights. For more information, see
IBM Applications, Cloud and Online Services
.
The information collected in a contractual relationship is not used for the purposes of marketing and advertising without obtaining consent before processing.
Support Services
When you contact us to request support, including through LiveChat, we collect your contact information, problem description, and possible resolutions. We record the information that is provided to handle the support query, for administrative purposes, to foster our relationship with you, for staff training, and for quality assurance purposes.
The information that we collect may include any information exchanged during our phone conversations or provided during Live Chat support sessions on our websites. This may include a recording or transcript of your conversations with us. We may use this information to inform you of products or services that are related to your support request. This can include product updates or fixes, and we may combine the information that is collected through other interactions with you or your organization to provide more valuable suggestions in relation to product support, such as any available training regarding the issue.
While we handle the support case, we may have incidental access to information that you have provided or information that is on your system. This information may contain information about you, your organization's employees, customers, or other relevant parties. The conditions regarding the handling and processing of this information is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between your organization and IBM, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.
Protecting You and IBM
We may collect and use information to protect you and IBM from IT security threats and to secure the information that we hold from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes information from our IT access authorization systems, such as log-in information.
The security solutions we use to protect your information, our infrastructure, and our networks may collect information such as IP addresses and log files. This is necessary for the functionality and utility of security programs to enable the investigation of any potential security incidents and generate insights on security threats.
We may use specialized tooling and other technical means to collect information at access points to, and in, IT systems and networks to detect unauthorized access, viruses, and indications of malicious activities. The information we collect may be used to conduct investigations when unauthorized access, malware or malicious activities are suspected, and to remove or isolate malicious code or content.
IBM Locations
When you visit an IBM location, we collect your name or business contact information (see
Your Account
), and, in some cases, information from a government issued ID. This information is collected for access management and to protect the security and safety of our locations and employees.
The information that is collected at our locations is used to issue access badges. We may verify the identity of visitors where legally permissible and, for supplier personnel working on site, a badge with a photo identification may be requested for identification purposes.
Camera supervision and access management are used for reasons of security and safety of our locations, employees, and assets. More information may be available at the IBM location.
Recruitment and Former Employees
We are constantly searching for new talent for our organization, and we collect information about job applicants or prospective candidates from several sources. Applicants are referred to the
Talent Acquisition Privacy Notice
for more information. When an employee leaves IBM, we continue to process information that is related to them for any remaining business, contractual, employment, legal, and fiscal purposes, including the management of pensions to the extent handled by IBM.
Regarding recruitment, we may look for prospective candidates with the help of recruitment intermediaries and may use publicly available information on social media platforms to identify prospective candidates for a specific function.
When an employee leaves IBM, we retain basic information from the former employee about their employment at IBM.
After an employee retires, we process information about the retiree for fulfilling the pension obligations toward the retiree. Information about the processing of pension information, or other retirement programs, can be found with the local organization responsible for pensions. In some countries, this may be an independent organization. In some cases, retirees may still participate in IBM-organized initiatives or programs, such as volunteer and social responsibility programs. Such participation is voluntary, and more information is provided on the relevant websites or information pages for those initiatives.
Conducting our Business Operations
We collect and use information to improve our business operations, systems, and processes. For example, information may be used to conduct, maintain, audit, and optimize our operations, to protect our assets and employees, for product development, and to defend our rights.
We collect information about our business operations to make informed decisions about the organization, the business, and to report on performance, audits, and trends. For example, we use this information to analyze the costs and quality of our operations. Where possible, this is done by using aggregated information, but may use personal information.
We collect and use information from our business systems, which may include personal information, to:
protect or enforce our rights, including to detect fraud or other criminal activities (for example, by using information in payment systems)
handle and resolve disputes
answer complaints and defend IBM in legal proceedings
and comply with legal obligations in the countries where we do business
We collect information from the use of our business processes, websites, cloud and online services, products, or technologies. This information may include personal information and is used for product and process development. For example, we may use this information to increase efficiency, decrease costs, or improve services by developing automated processes and tools, or to develop or improve the technologies on which these are based.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
When you visit our websites, cloud and online services, software products, or view our content on certain third-party websites, we collect information regarding your connection and your activity by using various online tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, Local Storage, or HTML5. Information that is collected with these technologies may be necessary to operate the website or service, to improve performance, to help us understand how our online services are used, or to determine the interests of our users. We use advertising partners to provide and assist in the use of such technologies on IBM and other sites.
A cookie is a piece of data that a website may send to your browser, which may be stored on your computer and can be used to identify your computer. Web beacons, including pixels and tags, are technologies that are used to track a user visiting an IBM web page or if a web page was copied to another website. Local Shared Objects can store content information displayed on the webpage visited, and preferences. All of these technologies may be used to provide connected features across our websites or display targeted IBM advertising (subject to your cookie preferences) on other websites based on your interests. Web beacons may also be used to track your interaction with email messages or newsletters, such as to determine whether messages are opened or links are selected.
Session cookies can be used to track your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information that you have already provided during the current session, or information that is needed to be able to complete a transaction. Session cookies are erased when the web browser is closed.
Persistent cookies issued by IBM expire every 14 months. IBM allows cookies issued by vendors on its websites. For cookies issued by vendors, persistent cookie retention periods are covered by the vendor's privacy policy.

Sharing Personal Information
We may share your personal information internally and externally with suppliers, advisors, or Business Partners for IBM’s legitimate business purposes, and only on a need-to-know basis. This section describes how we share information and how we facilitate that sharing.
How We Share Personal Information
When sharing personal information, we implement appropriate checks and controls to confirm that the information can be shared in accordance with the applicable law.
If we decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve disclosing some personal information to prospective or actual business purchasers, or the collection of personal information from those selling such businesses.
Internally, personal information is shared for our business purposes: to improve efficiency, for cost savings, and internal collaboration between our subsidiaries (such as Red Hat). For example, we may share personal information such as managing our relationship with you and other external parties, compliance programs, or systems and networks security.
Our internal access to personal information is restricted and granted only on a need-to-know basis. Sharing of this information is subject to the appropriate intracompany arrangements, our policies, and security standards. For more information, see
Legal Basis
.
Externally,
our business with suppliers may include the collection, use, analysis, or other types of processing of personal information on our behalf.
our business model includes cooperation with independent Business Partners for marketing, selling, and the provision of IBM products and services. Where appropriate (for example, when necessary for the fulfilment of an order), we share business contact information with selected Business Partners.
we may share personal information with professional advisors, including lawyers, auditors, and insurance companies to receive their services.
we may share contractual relationship information with others, for instance, our Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal, or government authorities, such as the customs authorities that are involved in fulfillment.
We may share personal information with third parties, such as advertising technology partners, data analytics providers and social networks engaged by IBM to deliver targeted IBM advertisements on their platforms, to aggregate information for analysis, and to track engagement with those advertisements.
In certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies in accordance with judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal processes. We may also share personal information to protect the rights of IBM or others when IBM believes that such rights may be affected, for example to prevent fraud.
Facilitating International Transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to or accessed by IBM subsidiaries and third parties globally. IBM complies with laws on the transfer of personal information between countries to keep your personal information protected, wherever it may be.
We have implemented various safeguards including:
Contractual Clauses, such as those approved by the EU Commission and accepted in several other countries. You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (EU SCCs) by selecting
Contact Us
in the header of this page.
Data Privacy Framework Certification. Where applicable, certain designated IBM services (for example, IBM Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, and select other hosted offerings) are certified to comply with the Data Privacy Framework. For more information, see
IBM Data Privacy Framework Policy for Certified IBM Cloud Services
.
Binding Corporate Rules for Controllers (IBM BCR-C). We have BCR-C approved by the European Data Protection Authorities and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. For more information, see
IBM Controller Binding Corporate Rules
.
IBM's privacy practices, described in this Privacy Statement, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules Framework. The
APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules
(CBPR) system provides protection of personal information that is transferred among participating
APEC economies
as it pertains to online information collected through ibm.com.
Controller and Representative Information
IBM does business through its subsidiaries worldwide. The privacy laws in some countries consider a Controller to be the legal entity (or natural person) who defines the purposes for which the processing of personal information takes place and how that information is processed. Parties that are involved in processing operations on behalf of a Controller may be designated as Processors. Designations and associated obligations differ, depending on the jurisdiction.
Where this is relevant for the privacy laws in your country, the Controller of your personal information is IBM’s main subsidiary in your country or region, unless International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp.) or another IBM subsidiary identifies itself as the Controller for a specific interaction with you.
The contact details of our main subsidiary of a country or region can be found by selecting your country or region and selecting Contact on the footer of ibm.com websites. IBM Corp. can be contacted at: International Business Machines Corporation, 1, North Castle Drive, Armonk, New York, United States of America.
Where IBM Corp. or a subsidiary it controls is required to appoint a legal representative, the following representatives have been appointed.
IBM International Group B.V.,
Johan Huizingalaan 765,
1066 VH Amsterdam,
The Netherlands
IBM United Kingdom Limited,
PO Box 41, North Harbour,
Portsmouth,
Hampshire, PO6 3AU,
United Kingdom
Information Security and Retention
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, we implement reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards. These safeguards include role-based access controls and encryption to keep personal information private while in transit. We also require our Business Partners, suppliers, and third parties to implement appropriate safeguards, such as contract terms and access restrictions, to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
IBM makes artificial intelligence models and systems available, including large language models (often called LLMs). IBM may use such AI models and systems on or embedded in IBM.com properties, including through chatbots. IBM may also make such AI models and systems available under separate terms.
IBM’s AI models and systems are designed, trained, validated, and tested on data from publicly available sources that may incidentally contain Personal Information. We have implemented safeguards, processes, and tools to mitigate associated impacts and help address responsible development and deployment of trustworthy AI.
We only retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, or to comply with legal and regulatory retention requirements. Legal and regulatory retention requirements may include retaining information for:
audit and accounting purposes,
statutory retention terms,
the handling of disputes,
and the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.
We retain any contractual relationship information for administrative purposes, legal and regulatory retention requirements, defending IBM rights, and to manage IBM's relationship with you. The information that is provided in a supplementary privacy notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.
When personal information is no longer needed, we have processes in place to securely delete it, for example by erasing electronic files and shredding physical records.

Legal Basis
In some jurisdictions, the lawful handling of personal information is subject to a justification, sometimes referred to as legal basis. The legal bases that we rely on for the lawful handling of your personal information vary depending on the purpose and applicable law.
The different legal bases that we may use are:
We rely on this legal basis when we need to process certain personal information, such as your contact details, payment details, and shipment details, to perform our obligations or to manage our
contractual relationship
with you.
Examples:
If you intend to purchase a product or service, we require your business contact information to enter into a contract with you or you may need to create an IBMid (see
Your Account
)
to access a purchased product online
.
When fulfilling a contract, you may need to receive
support services
, for which we will need to collect your contact information.
We need personal information to consider job applicants or manage the pension entitlements of retirees (see
Recruitment and Former Employees
).
Legitimate interests relate to being able to conduct and organize business, which includes the marketing of our offerings, protecting our legal interests, securing our IT environment, or meeting client requirements.
Examples:
We capture your use of, and interaction with
our websites
to improve them.
We process your IBMid (see
Your Account
) to manage access authorization of our services.
Where we have a
contractual relationship
with the organization that you are working for, we have a legitimate interest to process your personal information used to manage this contract.

We have to keep our
general business operations

IBM locations
for security and safety purposes.
We may also process personal information where it is necessary to defend our rights in judicial, administrative, or arbitral proceedings. This also falls under the legal basis of legitimate interest in countries where they are not a separate legal basis.
We process personal information for credit protection, which is a specific legal basis under Brazilian law (LGPD) but is also covered under the legal basis of legitimate interest in other countries.
The processing is based on your consent where we request this.
Example:
the optional use of
Cookies and Similar Technologies
or email of
Marketing
materials.
Where we need to process certain personal information based on our legal obligation
