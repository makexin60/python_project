Privacy Notice
Published on: 23 May 2018
Last updated on: 23 October 2024
This is the Privacy Notice for the F5 and NGINX brands. It explains the way that F5, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "F5") handle information about you that is collected in the contexts described below.
Management of our customer relationships, including through accounts you set up with F5.
Sales, including through resellers, distributors, partners, and third-party marketplaces.
Our certification programs.
Our training programs, including F5 University.
Our events.
Our marketing and advertising programs.
Our investor relations.
Management of our websites and apps in relation to any of the above.
Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other similar laws, F5 is considered a “controller” of that data because F5 determines how that data will be handled. F5, Inc. is typically the primary controller within the F5 group of companies.
This Privacy Notice also applies to personal data F5 receives in the context of providing its services (the “
Services
”).  For many Services, F5 acts only as a “processor” (not a controller) with respect to the personal data it collects through the Service.  This means that F5 handles the personal data solely pursuant to the relevant customer’s instructions, unless legally required to do otherwise.  The Service-specific Privacy Statements below explain F5’s role as a controller or processor with respect to particular Services and provide additional privacy information.

1. What types of Personal Data does F5 collect?
We collect, store, and use the following categories of personal data:
Contact details and professional details, such as name, email address, phone number, title, and employer's name.
Information about our users' experiences with F5 products, services, websites, events, webinars, and online forums and communities, such as DevCentral.
Contact information derived from interactions with F5 by our actual or prospective customers’ employees (e.g., interactions with customer service).
Information about actual or prospective users' interests.
Payment information for purchases with F5.
Audio and visual information, such as CCTV footage and recordings of some calls, meetings and events.
Additional details about certification candidates, including:
Identity documents and other personal data collected solely to authenticate the candidate's identity and for test security (such as photographs, fingerprints, or palm vein scans).
Personal data submitted for test accommodations (such as information about health or language concerns).
Test results.
Other personal data collected in connection with our Services, as described in the relevant Service-specific Privacy Statement.
We obtain personal data directly from you or your employer; from third-party sources such as our
Unity Partners
(which include resellers and distributors); third-party marketplaces where our products are offered (such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform); data brokers (such as Dun & Bradstreet); marketing companies; referrals from customers, and users; and from publicly available sources such as company websites and LinkedIn. Through some Services, we obtain personal data from our customers, or from individuals who interact with our customers or their online properties.
In some cases, F5 collects personal data through the technology described in Section 7 below.
2. How does F5 use and disclose Personal Data with others?
F5 uses and discloses personal data for the following purposes:
To analyze, improve, and develop F5 products and Services.
To provide our products, Services, events, websites, communities, training, and other business offerings.
To process payments.
To manage our relationships with customers, partners, resellers, distributors, event attendees, investors, and others (which may involve disclosing personal data to them).
For marketing, advertising, and other communications (including customizing those communications for specific recipients).
To provide a third party (such as an employer) with confirmation or denial of an individual's claimed certification status.
For surveys and other market research.
For security, IT management, and related research.
To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships (for example, we may disclose personal information with the opposing party, judge or arbitrator in a dispute).
To provide security and business continuity.
To follow the law, or in other cases where we believe that using or disclosing the data is appropriate to protect the rights, safety, and property of F5 or others (for example, when required to make disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
For an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, or reorganization, or due diligence in anticipation of such an event (for example, if a company were to acquire F5, it may also acquire the personal data we hold).
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users.
For those purposes, we may disclose personal data to, for example:
our affiliates;
our customers;
service providers, vendors, and other third parties that assist us, such as our
Unity Partners
, event providers, payment processors, marketing providers, testing providers, analytics providers, providers of technical services (e.g., providers of data storage, data backup, and CRM systems), and other subcontractors;
joint marketing partners;
security researchers;
employers and others who seek verification of an individual’s claimed certification status;
entities involved in dispute resolution (such as an arbitrator or an opposing party);
entities involved in potential or actual significant corporate transactions or events (such as those described in the second-to-last item in the list of uses and disclosures above);
governmental entities.
These uses and disclosures are also subject to our contractual obligations.
3. What are the legal reasons F5 can do this?
The laws in some jurisdictions require data controllers to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data. Where those laws apply, our legal grounds are:
Legitimate interests
: We handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of F5 (or of our customers, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:
Providing cybersecurity and managing information technology assets
Protecting business activities, individuals, and property
Providing customer service
Marketing and advertising (including sending certain direct marketing)
Analyzing and improving business activities
Managing risks and legal issues
To honor our contractual commitments to the individual
: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with him/her.  For example, when we process an individual’s payment data for a certification examination, we are relying on this basis.
Consent
:
If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent. For example, we conduct some of our direct marketing on the basis of consent.
If the law requires explicit consent, we use personal data on that basis.
If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.
Legal compliance
: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.
Legal claims
: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
4. What Personal Data rights and choices (including direct marketing opt-out) are available?
For personal data that we collect through our Services, the Privacy Statement for each Service has instructions for how you can exercise your legal rights with respect to such data. Where we process such data solely on behalf of a customer, those instructions typically will indicate that you should contact the customer to exercise those rights. In those cases, if you contact F5 instead, we normally will refer your request to the relevant customer (if we know who that is) and will cooperate with that customer’s handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that customer.
For other personal data (including certain personal data we collect through some of our Services), we offer the options below for exercising your rights and choices about how we use your personal data. Many of these are subject to important limits or exceptions under applicable laws and, where applicable, the EU-U.S., Swiss-U.S. and UK-US Data Privacy Frameworks (together “Data Privacy Framework”).
You may review and update certain information by logging into the relevant F5 websites or online services.
Our marketing email messages, and certain other communications include instructions about how to unsubscribe, which you can use to limit or stop those communications. Opt-out processes may take some time to complete, but we will work to meet your request quickly. You cannot opt out of certain communications (such as billing-related communications or emergency service messages).
You can exercise opt-out rights, object, or withdraw consent in relation to our use of certain cookies and certain similar technologies as described in Section 7 below.
The law of your jurisdiction (for example, within the United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland) may give you additional rights to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store. In some cases, you may be entitled to receive a copy of the personal data you provided to us in portable form or to request that we disclose it to a third party. The law may also give you the right to request restrictions on the use of your personal data, to object to our use of your personal data, or to withdraw your consent to use your personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect). Section 12 below explains how to make these requests.
For example, people who live in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland (and certain other people) have the right to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing. They can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.
For information about Californians’ privacy rights under California law, please see Section 13 below.
You may contact us with any concerns or complaints regarding our privacy practices, and you also may submit a complaint to the relevant governmental authority. (Individuals whose personal data we receive under our Data Privacy Framework certification also may file a Data Privacy Framework related complaint, as described in the Data Privacy Framework section below.)
For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to personal data after we have verified your identity to our satisfaction, taking into consideration the nature of your request.
5. Does the personal data go to other countries?
We are a global company with headquarters in the United States, and the F5 affiliates and third parties to whom we disclose the personal data as described in this Privacy Notice are located in the United States and elsewhere in the world, including countries where data protection laws may not provide as much protection as your country. Your personal information may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of these or other countries, pursuant to the laws of such countries. F5 complies with legal requirements for protecting the movement of data across borders, including through the use of European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
Please note that our customers may transfer personal data to F5 on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for transferring data across borders, such as Standard Contractual Clauses. If you wish to exercise a right to see copies of the mechanisms that F5 uses to transfer data to third parties, please contact us.
Finally, certain F5 services allow our customers and users to transfer data to third parties. Those customers and users are solely responsible for those transfers.

7. Does F5 use cookies and similar technology?
In our websites, apps, and emails, we and third parties may collect certain information by automated means such as cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, mobile-device functionality and other computer code. This information may include unique browser identifiers, IP address, browser and operating system information, device identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), geolocation, other device information, Internet connection information, as well as details about your interactions with our apps, websites, and emails (for example, the URL of the third-party website from which you came, the pages on our website that you visit, and the links you click on in our websites).
We and third parties may use these automated means to read or write information on your devices, such as in various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage), or to collect pieces of information that together may uniquely identify your device.
Cookies and local storage are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party may transfer to or read from your devices for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, such as to recognize the devices, to improve your use of our website and services, for cybersecurity, to prevent fraud, to provide services, and for record-keeping, analytics, and marketing, depending on the context of collection.
These technologies help us:
Keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.
Remember your settings on the pages you visit so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.
Display personalized content.
Perform analytics, measure traffic and usage trends, and better understand the demographics of our users.
Review and analyze user journeys on our websites and apps, such as how users engage with, linger on, navigate, and scroll through our services during a visit.
Diagnose and fix technology problems.
Plan for and enhance our business.
Also, in some cases, we assist with the collection of information by advertising services provided by third parties. The ad services may track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they may use this information to show you ads that are tailored to your individual interests or characteristics and/or based on your prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we or they know, infer, or have collected from the users like you.
For example, we and these services may use different types of cookies, other automated technology, and data to:
Recognize users and their devices.
Inform, optimize, and serve ads.
Report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to specific sites or apps).
Below, you can find options for adjusting your preferences for our use of various technologies on our websites in a particular browser.  For most of the cookie preference options described below, your opt-out will be stored a cookie.  That means that you can undo your opt-out by manually clearing the cookies in your browser or by using a browser that automatically clears cookies.  Depending on where you are and some other factors, this may reactivate the sorts of cookies that your previous preference had stopped.  If you do that and then decide to opt-out again for that browser, you will need to perform the relevant opt-out steps again in that browser.
By clicking on the cookie hyperlink in the footer of participating F5 websites, you can launch a consent tool to adjust your preferences about how certain cookies and certain similar technologies are used in F5 websites that hyperlink to that same preferences tool from their footer.  You should repeat this process with each browser you use to visit those websites.  This is the best way to control cookies on the sites that offer this option.
Analytics opt-outs: You can opt out of Google Analytics and customize Google Display Network ads by using the
Google Ads Settings
page from each browser. Google also allows you to install a
Google Analytics
Opt-out Browser Add-on for most browsers.
To learn more about interest-based advertising generally, or to use a different method to opt out of targeted, interest-based ads by some of our current ad service partners, visit
aboutads.info/choices
or
youronlinechoices.eu
from each browser you use.
In addition, you may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent. Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed as described
here
. However, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, local storage, JavaScript or other technologies, certain websites (including some of our own websites) may not function properly.
If you replace, change, or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again.
Please visit your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on any additional privacy controls in your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation. Please note, however, that we do not respond to browser-based privacy signals (such as do-not-track) at this time.
8. How long does F5 store Personal Data?
We will retain personal data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time. To provide security and business continuity for the activities described in this Privacy Notice, we make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original data.
9. What about security?
To help protect personal data, we have put in place physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. However, we cannot assure you that data that we collect will never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.
10. What about other kinds of data?
If the law and our contractual obligations allow, we may aggregate or de-identify your personal data so that the information cannot be linked to you and is no longer personal data. Our use and disclosure of non-personal data is not subject to this Privacy Notice, and we may use or disclose it for any reason permitted by law.
11. What happens when this Privacy Notice changes?
F5 may change this Privacy Notice at any time, including to reflect changes in the law or our data practices. Any updated Privacy Notice will be accessible from the footer of f5.com or another convenient location.

13. Special details for California residents
This Section 13 applies only to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and it supplements the information in the rest of our
F5 Privacy Notice
above. Data about individuals who are not residents of California is handled differently and is not subject to the same rights described in this Section. This Section does not apply to data that F5 handles in its capacity as a processor or “service provider” under the CCPA, even when such data is about a resident of California, or to other data or activities that are not subject to the privacy policy provisions of the CCPA.
Collection, Retention, and Use of California Personal Information
We collect (and during the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice we did collect) the categories of personal information described below.  We intend to retain this information for as long as we feel it is necessary for the purposes described further below, or for any longer period required by law.  Because we may collect and use the same category of personal information for different purposes and in different contexts, there is not typically a fixed retention period that always will apply to a particular category of personal information.  Examples of how long we normally intend to retain personal information in certain situations are set forth below.
Category of personal information
Examples of how long we normally plan to keep this information
identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information)
We may retain certain identifiers associated with points of contact within existing customers for the duration of the customer’s contract with F5, and for 2 years after that for related administration and sales purposes.
We may retain identifiers associated with non-customer persons collected in the context of sales until 1 year after they unsubscribe from emails, or 1 year after the person’s last interaction with F5 (whichever is greater) for analytics purposes.
commercial information (such as information about an individual’s interests and interactions with F5, our partners, or our customers, including transaction data);
We may retain certain information on a person’s interest in our products for up to 1 year after the person’s last interaction with F5, or 2 years after the end of a customer’s contract with F5 for sales and marketing purposes.
financial data (such as payment information)
We may retain financial data for 7 years in support of financial statements/filings and key financial or business process controls.
health information
If we collect health information from a certification candidate in a request for an accommodation, we dispose of it shortly after making an accommodation decision.  For more detail about retention of health information and other categories of data in the context of our F5 Certified! Professional Certification Program, please see that program’s
Privacy Statement
.
audio and visual information (such as CCTV images or recordings of calls or meetings)
If a customer contacts us for customer support on certain recorded lines, we often retain recordings of those conversations for one year.
biometric information (such as palm vein prints collected from certification candidates for identity verification and test security)
If an F5 Certified! testing partner collects fingerprints or palm vein scans for test security, the standard retention period is three years.  However, during active investigations or in connection with legal matters as permitted by law, this biometric data may be retained for six years or longer, except for candidates in Illinois, for whom absent a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a legal requirement that takes precedence over the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), this data is purged after three years.
internet or other network or device activity (such as IP addresses, device identifiers, cookie data, device attributes, device usage information, browsing information, metadata, and other information described in Section 7 of our Privacy Notice or Service-specific Privacy Statements)
We retain the California IP address associated with account logins on our own websites for several years for account authentication, fraud detection, and other cybersecurity purposes.
account login credentials
We retain account login credentials for the duration of the account and may further retain them for fraud prevention and cybersecurity purposes.
professional or employment related data (such as title)
We may retain various forms of professional related data received in the sales context for 1 year after the person’s (or their organization’s) last interaction with F5, or 2 years after the end of a customer’s contract with F5 for sales and marketing purposes.
inferences drawn from any of the above
We often retain inferences for the same period of time for which we retain the underlying data.
F5 uses personal information for the following purposes:
To analyze, improve, and develop F5 products and services.
To provide our products, services, events, websites, communities, training, and other business offerings.
To process payments.
To manage our relationships with customers, partners, resellers, distributors, event attendees, investors, and others.
For marketing, advertising, and other communications (including customizing those communications for specific recipients).
To provide a third party (such as an employer) with confirmation or denial of an individual's claimed certification status.
For surveys and other market research.
For security, IT management, and related research.
To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships.
To provide security and business continuity.
To follow the law, or in other cases where we believe that using or disclosing the data is appropriate to protect the rights, safety, and property of F5 or others (for example, when required to make disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
For an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, or reorganization, or due diligence in anticipation of such an event.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users.
“Sale,” “Sharing,” and Related Opt-out
As described further below, some of our disclosures of personal information qualify under the CCPA as what it defines as a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.  During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice, we “sold” and “shared” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA), what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on a website), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing from us) to third parties that assist us, such as marketing providers and analytics providers.  This practice continues today.  To our knowledge, we do not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
You can exercise your right to opt out of those disclosures by following the instructions on our “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
”  form.  (You also can exercise this right by leaving a voicemail with such request at +1 (844) 311-6885 and following the instructions we send you, but this option is slower.)
Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). Our websites each treat qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” of any California personal information that is collected on that site from that browser using cookies and similar technology.  You can override that treatment for a GPC-enabled browser by using the cookie controls available from the website’s footer to opt into particular categories of cookies from that browser.  In that case, “sales” via cookies and similar technology in those categories may resume on that browser.
Opting out of “sales” and “sharing” limits only some types of disclosures of personal information, and there are exceptions to all of the rights described in this section.
Other Disclosures of Personal Information
The following chart indicates the categories of personal information that we collected and the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed this data during the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice.

We do not use or disclose “sensitive personal information” covered by this Notice and as defined in the CCPA in a manner that requires us to offer a special right to limit our use of this data under the CCPA.
CCPA Right to Access, Correct, or Delete Personal Information
If you are a California resident, California law also may permit you to request that we:
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
Delete certain information we have about you;
·       Correct certain personal information we have about you; and
Inform you about the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we have disclosed certain personal information, and more specific detail about what categories of information were "sold," "shared" or disclosed to particular categories of third parties, similar to the detail above this section of the Privacy Policy;
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information to provide our services to you, so we may reject a deletion request for that information while providing services to you.
To request to exercise any of these rights and receive the fastest response, please use our
CCPA DSR Portal
or leave a voicemail with such request at +1 (844) 311-6885.  For security and legal reasons, F5 will not accept requests that require us to access third-party websites or services. We reserve the right to take steps verify your identity to our satisfaction before responding to your request, which may include, depending the type of request you are making, the sensitivity of any data you are requesting, and the nature of your relationship with us: verifying your name, asking you to click on a link that we send to your email address, requesting that you login to an account you maintain with us, or requesting that you provide us with information about our relationship that only you are likely to have.
Requests Made by Agents
If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof such as a notarized authentication letter or a power of attorney.  We also may require the consumer to verify their identity directly with us.  Because opt-out requests for “sales” and “sharing” made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our Services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves.  However, if a consumer wishes for an agent to perform browser-based requests on their behalf, the consumer may arrange for the agent to use the consumer’s browser to make such requests.  We are not responsible for the security risks of this or any other arrangements that a consumer may have with an agent.  For clarity, this is not permission for any user to disclose their login credentials to an agent or any third party.  Such disclosure is prohibited and is not required for an agent to make requests under this Privacy Notice.
Nondiscrimination
You also have a right not to receive “discriminatory treatment” (within the meaning of the CCPA) for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.

Privacy Notice
Published on: 23 May 2018
Last updated on: 23 October 2024
This is the Privacy Notice for the F5 and NGINX brands. It explains the way that F5, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "F5") handle information about you that is collected in the contexts described below.
Management of our customer relationships, including through accounts you set up with F5.
Sales, including through resellers, distributors, partners, and third-party marketplaces.
Our certification programs.
Our training programs, including F5 University.
Our events.
Our marketing and advertising programs.
Our investor relations.
Management of our websites and apps in relation to any of the above.
Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other similar laws, F5 is considered a “controller” of that data because F5 determines how that data will be handled. F5, Inc. is typically the primary controller within the F5 group of companies.
This Privacy Notice also applies to personal data F5 receives in the context of providing its services (the “
Services
”).  For many Services, F5 acts only as a “processor” (not a controller) with respect to the personal data it collects through the Service.  This means that F5 handles the personal data solely pursuant to the relevant customer’s instructions, unless legally required to do otherwise.  The Service-specific Privacy Statements below explain F5’s role as a controller or processor with respect to particular Services and provide additional privacy information.

1. What types of Personal Data does F5 collect?
We collect, store, and use the following categories of personal data:
Contact details and professional details, such as name, email address, phone number, title, and employer's name.
Information about our users' experiences with F5 products, services, websites, events, webinars, and online forums and communities, such as DevCentral.
Contact information derived from interactions with F5 by our actual or prospective customers’ employees (e.g., interactions with customer service).
Information about actual or prospective users' interests.
Payment information for purchases with F5.
Audio and visual information, such as CCTV footage and recordings of some calls, meetings and events.
Additional details about certification candidates, including:
Identity documents and other personal data collected solely to authenticate the candidate's identity and for test security (such as photographs, fingerprints, or palm vein scans).
Personal data submitted for test accommodations (such as information about health or language concerns).
Test results.
Other personal data collected in connection with our Services, as described in the relevant Service-specific Privacy Statement.
We obtain personal data directly from you or your employer; from third-party sources such as our
Unity Partners
(which include resellers and distributors); third-party marketplaces where our products are offered (such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform); data brokers (such as Dun & Bradstreet); marketing companies; referrals from customers, and users; and from publicly available sources such as company websites and LinkedIn. Through some Services, we obtain personal data from our customers, or from individuals who interact with our customers or their online properties.
In some cases, F5 collects personal data through the technology described in Section 7 below.
2. How does F5 use and disclose Personal Data with others?
F5 uses and discloses personal data for the following purposes:
To analyze, improve, and develop F5 products and Services.
To provide our products, Services, events, websites, communities, training, and other business offerings.
To process payments.
To manage our relationships with customers, partners, resellers, distributors, event attendees, investors, and others (which may involve disclosing personal data to them).
For marketing, advertising, and other communications (including customizing those communications for specific recipients).
To provide a third party (such as an employer) with confirmation or denial of an individual's claimed certification status.
For surveys and other market research.
For security, IT management, and related research.
To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships (for example, we may disclose personal information with the opposing party, judge or arbitrator in a dispute).
To provide security and business continuity.
To follow the law, or in other cases where we believe that using or disclosing the data is appropriate to protect the rights, safety, and property of F5 or others (for example, when required to make disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
For an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, or reorganization, or due diligence in anticipation of such an event (for example, if a company were to acquire F5, it may also acquire the personal data we hold).
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users.
For those purposes, we may disclose personal data to, for example:
our affiliates;
our customers;
service providers, vendors, and other third parties that assist us, such as our
Unity Partners
, event providers, payment processors, marketing providers, testing providers, analytics providers, providers of technical services (e.g., providers of data storage, data backup, and CRM systems), and other subcontractors;
joint marketing partners;
security researchers;
employers and others who seek verification of an individual’s claimed certification status;
entities involved in dispute resolution (such as an arbitrator or an opposing party);
entities involved in potential or actual significant corporate transactions or events (such as those described in the second-to-last item in the list of uses and disclosures above);
governmental entities.
These uses and disclosures are also subject to our contractual obligations.
3. What are the legal reasons F5 can do this?
The laws in some jurisdictions require data controllers to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data. Where those laws apply, our legal grounds are:
Legitimate interests
: We handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of F5 (or of our customers, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:
Providing cybersecurity and managing information technology assets
Protecting business activities, individuals, and property
Providing customer service
Marketing and advertising (including sending certain direct marketing)
Analyzing and improving business activities
Managing risks and legal issues
To honor our contractual commitments to the individual
: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with him/her.  For example, when we process an individual’s payment data for a certification examination, we are relying on this basis.
Consent
:
If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent. For example, we conduct some of our direct marketing on the basis of consent.
If the law requires explicit consent, we use personal data on that basis.
If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.
Legal compliance
: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.
Legal claims
: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
4. What Personal Data rights and choices (including direct marketing opt-out) are available?
For personal data that we collect through our Services, the Privacy Statement for each Service has instructions for how you can exercise your legal rights with respect to such data. Where we process such data solely on behalf of a customer, those instructions typically will indicate that you should contact the customer to exercise those rights. In those cases, if you contact F5 instead, we normally will refer your request to the relevant customer (if we know who that is) and will cooperate with that customer’s handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that customer.
For other personal data (including certain personal data we collect through some of our Services), we offer the options below for exercising your rights and choices about how we use your personal data. Many of these are subject to important limits or exceptions under applicable laws and, where applicable, the EU-U.S., Swiss-U.S. and UK-US Data Privacy Frameworks (together “Data Privacy Framework”).
You may review and update certain information by logging into the relevant F5 websites or online services.
Our marketing email messages, and certain other communications include instructions about how to unsubscribe, which you can use to limit or stop those communications. Opt-out processes may take some time to complete, but we will work to meet your request quickly. You cannot opt out of certain communications (such as billing-related communications or emergency service messages).
You can exercise opt-out rights, object, or withdraw consent in relation to our use of certain cookies and certain similar technologies as described in Section 7 below.
The law of your jurisdiction (for example, within the United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland) may give you additional rights to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store. In some cases, you may be entitled to receive a copy of the personal data you provided to us in portable form or to request that we disclose it to a third party. The law may also give you the right to request restrictions on the use of your personal data, to object to our use of your personal data, or to withdraw your consent to use your personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect). Section 12 below explains how to make these requests.
For example, people who live in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland (and certain other people) have the right to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing. They can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.
For information about Californians’ privacy rights under California law, please see Section 13 below.
You may contact us with any concerns or complaints regarding our privacy practices, and you also may submit a complaint to the relevant governmental authority. (Individuals whose personal data we receive under our Data Privacy Framework certification also may file a Data Privacy Framework related complaint, as described in the Data Privacy Framework section below.)
For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to personal data after we have verified your identity to our satisfaction, taking into consideration the nature of your request.
5. Does the personal data go to other countries?
We are a global company with headquarters in the United States, and the F5 affiliates and third parties to whom we disclose the personal data as described in this Privacy Notice are located in the United States and elsewhere in the world, including countries where data protection laws may not provide as much protection as your country. Your personal information may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of these or other countries, pursuant to the laws of such countries. F5 complies with legal requirements for protecting the movement of data across borders, including through the use of European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
Please note that our customers may transfer personal data to F5 on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for transferring data across borders, such as Standard Contractual Clauses. If you wish to exercise a right to see copies of the mechanisms that F5 uses to transfer data to third parties, please contact us.
Finally, certain F5 services allow our customers and users to transfer data to third parties. Those customers and users are solely responsible for those transfers.

7. Does F5 use cookies and similar technology?
In our websites, apps, and emails, we and third parties may collect certain information by automated means such as cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, mobile-device functionality and other computer code. This information may include unique browser identifiers, IP address, browser and operating system information, device identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID), geolocation, other device information, Internet connection information, as well as details about your interactions with our apps, websites, and emails (for example, the URL of the third-party website from which you came, the pages on our website that you visit, and the links you click on in our websites).
We and third parties may use these automated means to read or write information on your devices, such as in various types of cookies and other browser-based or plugin-based local storage (such as HTML5 storage or Flash-based storage), or to collect pieces of information that together may uniquely identify your device.
Cookies and local storage are files that contain data, such as unique identifiers, that we or a third party may transfer to or read from your devices for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, such as to recognize the devices, to improve your use of our website and services, for cybersecurity, to prevent fraud, to provide services, and for record-keeping, analytics, and marketing, depending on the context of collection.
These technologies help us:
Keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.
Remember your settings on the pages you visit so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.
Display personalized content.
Perform analytics, measure traffic and usage trends, and better understand the demographics of our users.
Review and analyze user journeys on our websites and apps, such as how users engage with, linger on, navigate, and scroll through our services during a visit.
Diagnose and fix technology problems.
Plan for and enhance our business.
Also, in some cases, we assist with the collection of information by advertising services provided by third parties. The ad services may track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means such as cookies, and they may use this information to show you ads that are tailored to your individual interests or characteristics and/or based on your prior visits to certain sites or apps, or other information we or they know, infer, or have collected from the users like you.
For example, we and these services may use different types of cookies, other automated technology, and data to:
Recognize users and their devices.
Inform, optimize, and serve ads.
Report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to specific sites or apps).
Below, you can find options for adjusting your preferences for our use of various technologies on our websites in a particular browser.  For most of the cookie preference options described below, your opt-out will be stored a cookie.  That means that you can undo your opt-out by manually clearing the cookies in your browser or by using a browser that automatically clears cookies.  Depending on where you are and some other factors, this may reactivate the sorts of cookies that your previous preference had stopped.  If you do that and then decide to opt-out again for that browser, you will need to perform the relevant opt-out steps again in that browser.
By clicking on the cookie hyperlink in the footer of participating F5 websites, you can launch a consent tool to adjust your preferences about how certain cookies and certain similar technologies are used in F5 websites that hyperlink to that same preferences tool from their footer.  You should repeat this process with each browser you use to visit those websites.  This is the best way to control cookies on the sites that offer this option.
Analytics opt-outs: You can opt out of Google Analytics and customize Google Display Network ads by using the
Google Ads Settings
page from each browser. Google also allows you to install a
Google Analytics
Opt-out Browser Add-on for most browsers.
To learn more about interest-based advertising generally, or to use a different method to opt out of targeted, interest-based ads by some of our current ad service partners, visit
aboutads.info/choices
or
youronlinechoices.eu
from each browser you use.
In addition, you may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent. Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed as described
here
. However, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, local storage, JavaScript or other technologies, certain websites (including some of our own websites) may not function properly.
If you replace, change, or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again.
Please visit your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on any additional privacy controls in your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation. Please note, however, that we do not respond to browser-based privacy signals (such as do-not-track) at this time.
8. How long does F5 store Personal Data?
We will retain personal data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time. To provide security and business continuity for the activities described in this Privacy Notice, we make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original data.
9. What about security?
To help protect personal data, we have put in place physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. However, we cannot assure you that data that we collect will never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.
10. What about other kinds of data?
If the law and our contractual obligations allow, we may aggregate or de-identify your personal data so that the information cannot be linked to you and is no longer personal data. Our use and disclosure of non-personal data is not subject to this Privacy Notice, and we may use or disclose it for any reason permitted by law.
11. What happens when this Privacy Notice changes?
F5 may change this Privacy Notice at any time, including to reflect changes in the law or our data practices. Any updated Privacy Notice will be accessible from the footer of f5.com or another convenient location.

13. Special details for California residents
This Section 13 applies only to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and it supplements the information in the rest of our
F5 Privacy Notice
above. Data about individuals who are not residents of California is handled differently and is not subject to the same rights described in this Section. This Section does not apply to data that F5 handles in its capacity as a processor or “service provider” under the CCPA, even when such data is about a resident of California, or to other data or activities that are not subject to the privacy policy provisions of the CCPA.
Collection, Retention, and Use of California Personal Information
We collect (and during the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice we did collect) the categories of personal information described below.  We intend to retain this information for as long as we feel it is necessary for the purposes described further below, or for any longer period required by law.  Because we may collect and use the same category of personal information for different purposes and in different contexts, there is not typically a fixed retention period that always will apply to a particular category of personal information.  Examples of how long we normally intend to retain personal information in certain situations are set forth below.
Category of personal information
Examples of how long we normally plan to keep this information
identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information)
We may retain certain identifiers associated with points of contact within existing customers for the duration of the customer’s contract with F5, and for 2 years after that for related administration and sales purposes.
We may retain identifiers associated with non-customer persons collected in the context of sales until 1 year after they unsubscribe from emails, or 1 year after the person’s last interaction with F5 (whichever is greater) for analytics purposes.
commercial information (such as information about an individual’s interests and interactions with F5, our partners, or our customers, including transaction data);
We may retain certain information on a person’s interest in our products for up to 1 year after the person’s last interaction with F5, or 2 years after the end of a customer’s contract with F5 for sales and marketing purposes.
financial data (such as payment information)
We may retain financial data for 7 years in support of financial statements/filings and key financial or business process controls.
health information
If we collect health information from a certification candidate in a request for an accommodation, we dispose of it shortly after making an accommodation decision.  For more detail about retention of health information and other categories of data in the context of our F5 Certified! Professional Certification Program, please see that program’s
Privacy Statement
.
audio and visual information (such as CCTV images or recordings of calls or meetings)
If a customer contacts us for customer support on certain recorded lines, we often retain recordings of those conversations for one year.
biometric information (such as palm vein prints collected from certification candidates for identity verification and test security)
If an F5 Certified! testing partner collects fingerprints or palm vein scans for test security, the standard retention period is three years.  However, during active investigations or in connection with legal matters as permitted by law, this biometric data may be retained for six years or longer, except for candidates in Illinois, for whom absent a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a legal requirement that takes precedence over the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), this data is purged after three years.
internet or other network or device activity (such as IP addresses, device identifiers, cookie data, device attributes, device usage information, browsing information, metadata, and other information described in Section 7 of our Privacy Notice or Service-specific Privacy Statements)
We retain the California IP address associated with account logins on our own websites for several years for account authentication, fraud detection, and other cybersecurity purposes.
account login credentials
We retain account login credentials for the duration of the account and may further retain them for fraud prevention and cybersecurity purposes.
professional or employment related data (such as title)
We may retain various forms of professional related data received in the sales context for 1 year after the person’s (or their organization’s) last interaction with F5, or 2 years after the end of a customer’s contract with F5 for sales and marketing purposes.
inferences drawn from any of the above
We often retain inferences for the same period of time for which we retain the underlying data.
F5 uses personal information for the following purposes:
To analyze, improve, and develop F5 products and services.
To provide our products, services, events, websites, communities, training, and other business offerings.
To process payments.
To manage our relationships with customers, partners, resellers, distributors, event attendees, investors, and others.
For marketing, advertising, and other communications (including customizing those communications for specific recipients).
To provide a third party (such as an employer) with confirmation or denial of an individual's claimed certification status.
For surveys and other market research.
For security, IT management, and related research.
To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships.
To provide security and business continuity.
To follow the law, or in other cases where we believe that using or disclosing the data is appropriate to protect the rights, safety, and property of F5 or others (for example, when required to make disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities, such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
For an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, or reorganization, or due diligence in anticipation of such an event.
For other purposes requested or permitted by our customers or users.
“Sale,” “Sharing,” and Related Opt-out
As described further below, some of our disclosures of personal information qualify under the CCPA as what it defines as a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.  During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice, we “sold” and “shared” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA), what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on a website), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing from us) to third parties that assist us, such as marketing providers and analytics providers.  This practice continues today.  To our knowledge, we do not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
You can exercise your right to opt out of those disclosures by following the instructions on our “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
”  form.  (You also can exercise this right by leaving a voicemail with such request at +1 (844) 311-6885 and following the instructions we send you, but this option is slower.)
Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). Our websites each treat qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” of any California personal information that is collected on that site from that browser using cookies and similar technology.  You can override that treatment for a GPC-enabled browser by using the cookie controls available from the website’s footer to opt into particular categories of cookies from that browser.  In that case, “sales” via cookies and similar technology in those categories may resume on that browser.
Opting out of “sales” and “sharing” limits only some types of disclosures of personal information, and there are exceptions to all of the rights described in this section.
Other Disclosures of Personal Information
The following chart indicates the categories of personal information that we collected and the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed this data during the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Notice.

We do not use or disclose “sensitive personal information” covered by this Notice and as defined in the CCPA in a manner that requires us to offer a special right to limit our use of this data under the CCPA.
CCPA Right to Access, Correct, or Delete Personal Information
If you are a California resident, California law also may permit you to request that we:
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
Delete certain information we have about you;
·       Correct certain personal information we have about you; and
Inform you about the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we have disclosed certain personal information, and more specific detail about what categories of information were "sold," "shared" or disclosed to particular categories of third parties, similar to the detail above this section of the Privacy Policy;
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information to provide our services to you, so we may reject a deletion request for that information while providing services to you.
To request to exercise any of these rights and receive the fastest response, please use our
CCPA DSR Portal
or leave a voicemail with such request at +1 (844) 311-6885.  For security and legal reasons, F5 will not accept requests that require us to access third-party websites or services. We reserve the right to take steps verify your identity to our satisfaction before responding to your request, which may include, depending the type of request you are making, the sensitivity of any data you are requesting, and the nature of your relationship with us: verifying your name, asking you to click on a link that we send to your email address, requesting that you login to an account you maintain with us, or requesting that you provide us with information about our relationship that only you are likely to have.
Requests Made by Agents
If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof such as a notarized authentication letter or a power of attorney.  We also may require the consumer to verify their identity directly with us.  Because opt-out requests for “sales” and “sharing” made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our Services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves.  However, if a consumer wishes for an agent to perform browser-based requests on their behalf, the consumer may arrange for the agent to use the consumer’s browser to make such requests.  We are not responsible for the security risks of this or any other arrangements that a consumer may have with an agent.  For clarity, this is not permission for any user to disclose their login credentials to an agent or any third party.  Such disclosure is prohibited and is not required for an agent to make requests under this Privacy Notice.
Nondiscrimination
You also have a right not to receive “discriminatory treatment” (within the meaning of the CCPA) for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.

Aspen Mesh Privacy Statement
Published on: 1 March 2022
F5 (including the Aspen Mesh business) receives no personal data through the Aspen Mesh products and services.  To the extent these products and services process personal data, this happens entirely within the customer’s network. The customer may be a “controller” or “processor” of that data within the meaning of the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, but F5 is neither because F5 does not process the data.
Personal data processed in the context of Aspen Mesh-related sales, support, training, and other business functions is handled as described in the main

F5 BIG-IP & Services Privacy Statement
Published on: 1 July 2020
Last updated on: 4 October 2023
Overview
F5 offers network and security solutions branded as BIG-IP in the form of BIG-IP hardware, BIG-IP Virtual Edition, and BIG-IP Cloud Edition (collectively, the “BIG-IP Solutions”).  F5 also provides support, maintenance, and professional services for the BIG-IP Solutions (the “Services”).
F5 does not process personal data through the BIG-IP Solutions.  This Privacy Statement applies to the customer data that F5 processes through the Services.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the customer data, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
Collection and Processing of Personal Data
The BIG-IP Solutions process customer network traffic (which may contain IP addresses or other personal data) within the customer’s location or within the customer’s own cloud environment—all without transmitting network traffic or other personal data to F5.  F5 does not provide a cloud environment in which BIG-IP Solutions operate.
Customers who use support and maintenance Services may choose to provide F5 with personal data.  One way they can do this is by providing F5 with a file called a QKView, which contains network and configuration details relevant to the BIG-IP Solution, including a sampling of its log files, which contain IP addresses.  The customer would take specific steps to generate the QKView and manually upload it to iHealth, an F5 support website.  After running an automated process that removes certain kinds of data from the snapshot (such as portions that appear to be formatted like passwords or private keys), the iHealth website can display the contents of the QKView in human-readable form for the customer or F5 personnel.
The other way a customer can provide F5 with personal data in the support and maintenance context is by taking specific steps to create, and then manually upload to F5, a different type of snapshot from the BIG-IP Solution’s memory cores (or their virtual equivalent), or a snapshot of the traffic passing through the BIG-IP Solution.  These snapshots typically contain IP addresses.  If the customer uses the BIG-IP Solution to process traffic that contains personal data, the snapshot may contain random snippets of such personal data.
On occasion, F5 customers may return a BIG-IP device to F5 through our Return Material Authorization (RMA) process.  F5 provides instructions to customers about how to remove their data from their devices prior to return.  If a customer does not follow this process, F5 overwrites the data after receiving the device.  F5 also offers RMA alternatives that allow customers to retain out-of-service BIG-IP devices while still receiving a replacement.
F5’s provision of professional services to the customer may, depending on the Services and the customer’s needs, involve incidental access by F5 personnel to the sorts of data described above.
More Information
To exercise your rights with respect to the customer data that F5 processes in connection with a customer’s BIG-IP Solution or Services, please contact that customer. F5’s Data Privacy Framework Certification covers this data to the extent it is personal data. For more information about F5’s privacy practices, please see the

F5 Distributed Cloud Data Intelligence Privacy Statement
Published: 24 April 2022
Last Updated on: January 5, 2023
Overview
F5 Data Intelligence (the “Service”) creates signals for online fraud analysis. This Privacy Statement applies to the customer data that the Service uses.
This Privacy Statement applies to the data that the Service collects.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the data about the customer’s users, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
Personal Data Collected by the Service
The Service uses JavaScript and other technical means to process the following information about users of the customer’s online properties:
Current IP address and pseudorandomly generated UUID of the device that is using the customer’s online property;
Data about the user’s browser or device;
Data about the user’s interaction with the browser or device; and
A customer-assigned or F5-assigned reference number for communicating with the customer about the interaction.
Processing of the Personal Data
The Service analyzes those data points and provides the customer with a group of outputs that the customer can use to assess the interaction for fraud. These include observations about the user’s browser or device and about the user’s interactions with it. Outside of the Service, the customer can (i) consider these outputs with other data the customer independently collects about the user and about the interaction and (ii) decide what action to take (such as to block the transaction, allow the transaction, or take additional steps to investigate the transaction).
What to Do If Your Access to an Online Property Has Been Blocked
If you believe that the Service has been used as an input for an F5 customer’s decision to improperly block or restrict your access to their online property, please contact that customer to request restoration of your access.
More Information
To exercise your rights with respect to the customer data that F5 processes when providing the Service to a customer, please contact that customer. For more information about F5’s privacy practices, please see the

F5 Distributed Cloud Account Protection Privacy Statement
Published on: 1 March 2021
Last updated on: 15 February 2022
Overview
F5 Distributed Cloud Account Protection (the “Service”) offers a converged solution for application security and fraud mitigation. This Privacy Statement applies to the customer data that the Service uses.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the data about the customer’s users, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
Personal Data Processed by the Service
The Service uses JavaScript and other technical means to process the following information about users of the customer’s online properties:
Account identifier (such as a username or hashed username);
Current IP address and pseudorandomly generated UUID of the device that is using the customer’s online property;
Data about the user’s browser or device; and
Data about the user’s interaction with the browser or device.
The Service is highly customizable, and the processing for any particular customer could involve a variety of additional data points relevant to fraud detection, including specialized data types that are unique to that customer’s business.
Processing of the Personal Data
The Service analyzes the data and makes a fraud assessment or recommendation for the customer. The customer may then choose to act on that output directly (such as by blocking a transaction) or to consider that output in connection with additional fraud signals that the customer has.  In some implementations of the Service, the customer can use the Service itself to perform the blocking.
What to Do If Your Access to an Online Property Has Been Blocked
If you believe that the Service has been used to improperly block or restrict your access to an F5 customer’s online property, please contact that customer to request restoration of your access.

F5 Distributed Cloud App Infrastructure Protection (AIP) Privacy Statement
Published on: 4 April 2022
Last updated on: 15 December 2022
Overview
F5's Distributed Cloud App Infrastructure Protection (the “Service”) provides intrusion detection and other Event alerting for customers’ cloud infrastructure. It takes in Events from multiple sources, including host-based agents and AWS Fargate. If available, it can ingest events from the customer’s AWS CloudTrail for infrastructure monitoring. The Service can apply both rules-based detection and machine-learning analysis to generate alerts, which the customer can integrate into third-party SecOps tools for ticketing/paging. Customers can also receive a feed of all Events ingested to build their own workflows. A 24/7 Security Operations Center and custom analytics are optional add-ons.
This Privacy Statement applies to the data that the Service collects.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the data, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it is personal data.
Personal Data Collected by the Service
The Service ingests “Events,” which are records of specific types of activity or conditions in the customer’s infrastructure. For example, an Event may indicate that the access permissions to a particular resource within the customer’s infrastructure have been changed, that a file on the host has exceeded a specified size, that an attempt was made to log in to a host via SSH, or that the security policy for the customer’s AWS S3 bucket has changed.
Events conform to a schema defined by F5, which is designed to avoid inadvertent collection of personal data.
In typical implementations of the Service, the data subjects of Events, to the extent Events are personal data, are external attackers or a small number of customer personnel that have access to the protected infrastructure. For example, an Event may include the IP address of a customer employee that has administrative access to the customer’s infrastructure. The Service is not typically used in a manner that involves data about the customer’s external end users or their devices, such as their IP addresses or hardware identifiers.
Processing of the Personal Data
The Service applies customer-selected rules to the Event data, and it can also analyze the data to develop new rules or custom analytics.  The Service outputs alerts, analytics, and raw Event data for the customer’s use.
More Information
To exercise your rights with respect to the customer data that F5 processes when providing the Service to a customer, please contact that customer. For more information about F5’s privacy practices, please see the

IP address;
Data about the user’s browser or device;
Data about the user’s interaction with the browser or device;
Fuzzy identifiers (which we generate from IP addresses, User Agent strings, and select telemetry data); and
DID identifiers (values that we pseudo-randomly generate).

F5 Distributed Cloud Authentication Intelligence™ Privacy Statement
Published on: 28 September 2021
Overview
From a user perspective, being forced to re-authenticate to a website can be a hassle, especially if the user has good password practices, like having a different long, unique password for each website. This increases the likelihood that the user can’t remember the password and must perform a password reset at a critical time, and sometimes users can’t complete the password reset either (for example, because they don’t remember the username either, or can’t remember the answer to a security question). However, meeting user demand for logins to persist for longer can create a risk to the user when they login from a browser that they share with others, like browsers on computers in hotel business centers, common living areas, or certain workplace computers. In those cases, keeping a user logged in may result in exposing that user’s account to the next person to use the same browser. Website operators want to give users the full login sessions they desire, but only when it’s safe to do so. Shape Recognize™ (the “Service”) helps them do that.
The Service works by assessing whether the visitor’s browser is likely to be shared by multiple individuals. If not, the website can keep the visitor logged in for the desired duration. If so, the website operator can require earlier re-authentication. This Privacy Statement applies to the data that the Service uses.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the data about the customer’s users, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
Personal Data Collected by the Service
The Service collects data from the browsers and devices of visitors to the customer’s website. We use automated means to collect this data.
The Service uses the following data:
Current IP address of the device that is using the customer’s online property;
A collection of technical data about the browser or device, which sometimes may be unique to the browser or device (though Shape cannot determine when that is the case); and
Where applicable, a record of whether that the combination of that IP address with that collection of technical data (a “Combination”) is associated more than one account with at least one customer.
Processing of the Personal Data
If a Service customer’s user is visiting the customer’s website from a non-unique Combination, Shape will alert the customer, who can choose to take defensive measures, such as requiring the user to log in again sooner than would normally be the case, especially prior to when the user engages in a logged-in activity that the customer determines should be private to the authentic user (like completing a purchase or reviewing account details).

F5 Distributed Cloud Bot Defense (Managed Service) Privacy Statement
Published on: 1 July 2020
Last updated on: 15 February 2022
Overview
F5 Distributed Cloud (Managed Service) (the "Service") assesses the security/fraud risk of interactions with F5 customers’ online properties. The Service can be configured to block or simply flag suspected security/fraud risks. This Privacy Statement applies to the data that the Service uses.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of data about its customer’s users, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
Personal Data Collected by the Service
The Service is available in several deployment models and numerous data configurations. Generally, however, the Service will process data collected data from the browsers and devices of users of the customer’s online properties:
Current IP address and pseudorandomly generated UUID of the device that is using the customer’s online property.
Information from interactions between the user (and their browser or device) and the online property; and
Other technical data about the browser or device that may be used to screen for malicious activity.
Processing of the Personal Data
The Service uses the data to determine whether an interaction with the customer’s online property is from an unauthorized bot or is otherwise poses a security risk.  If the Service determines that it is, the Service either blocks or flags the traffic and creates a log of this event for that customer’s later review.

F5 Certified!™ Professional Certification Program Privacy Statement
Published on: 20 July 2022
Last updated on: 10 February 2023
1. Overview
The
F5 Certified!™ Professional Certification Program
provides certificate holders with an internationally recognized validation that they have the skills, understanding and knowledge necessary to work with F5 products and services.
2. Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a controller of personal data that F5 collects in connection with its administration of the F5 Certified! ™ program, while testing providers (such as Pearson VUE and Prometric) act as F5’s processor for collection of personal data to administer F5 examinations.
3. Personal Data Collected by the Service
To register into the F5 Certified!™ program on the certification portal, we collect candidate contact information, such as:
First & last name
Email address
Physical address (country, city & street address)
When the candidate visits an exam provider to take a certification exam, the provider will collect or review additional personal data for exam integrity and fraud prevention purposes, as described in the next section.  The specific data will vary by provider and location, but generally this will include:
Two forms of identification, one of which must be government-issued and include a picture ID, both of which must contain a signature;
Digital signature;
A photograph of the candidate;
Audio and video monitoring of the examination location; and
Biometric information, such as fingerprint or palm vein scan.
Candidates may also provide F5 with personal data relating to requested testing accommodations (such as information about health, or records establishing language concerns).
We also maintain records of candidates’ certification status and testing history.
4. Use and Disclosure of Personal Data
F5 uses and discloses candidate contact information, and the records of a candidate’s certification and testing history, to administer the exams, communicate with the candidate about their certifications and the F5 Certified!™ program, provide validation to third parties regarding whether the individual holds a certification, and as otherwise described in the
F5 Privacy Notice
.
F5 products and services play a critical role in the stability and security of our customers’ networks, and the certifications we issue help our customers choose the most qualified personnel to manage and advise them on those product and services.  Given the negative consequences that could result from the fraudulent acquisition of an F5 certification (for example, a large-scale personal data breach caused by the incorrect use of an F5 product by an individual who obtained their role by cheating on an F5 certification exam), we implement extensive security and anti-fraud measures to protect the integrity of our F5 Certified!™ program.
Cheating attempts take many forms, such hiring an expert to pose as the candidate and take the exam; attempting to photograph the exam for later sale of exam questions; taking the exam multiple times to memorize questions (for the same purpose); and communication with a third party while taking the exam.
We use all the personal data we collect in the certification context to combat cheating and protect the integrity of the certification program.  For example, our exam providers use the biometric information to confirm that the candidate has not previously taken an examination while using a different identity, and they use audio and video monitoring of the exam room to ensure that candidates do not copy the exam or communicate with each other or with third parties.
Biometric data is processed by the exam provider (not F5), and it is processed only on the basis of explicit consent. Candidates that will not provide this consent for a particular exam must notify F5 of this via an Admission Data Waiver form submitted at least 30 days in advance of the exam so that appropriate procedures will be ready.  Other identity verification data (such as signatures and photographs) are processed on the basis of the legitimate interest of protecting the integrity of the certification process, an interest that is shared by F5, certification candidates, employers of certification candidates, and the public that relies on the networks that F5-certified individuals help to maintain and secure.
Audio and video monitoring of the exam location is processed on the basis of the legitimate interest of protecting the integrity of the certification process and, in some locations, based on the express consent of the candidate.
Personal data regarding testing accommodation requests is used to process those requests and to perform our obligations under the certification agreement, consistent with the need for exam integrity and security.
5. Data Retention
Normal retention periods for particular data types are described below, but these periods may be extended as reasonably necessary for the following purposes, when legally permissible:
conducting an investigation regarding cheating, theft, or other misconduct;
addressing an escalation or complaint made by a candidate or third party;
addressing other legal or insurance issues;
complying with a legal retention obligation.
Given the lifetime value of a certification, test results and certification history (dates that particular certifications were achieved) are currently slated to be retained for up to 40 years.
Personal data detailing the reason why a particular testing accommodation is requested is deleted when a final decision is made regarding whether to implement the accommodation.
Audio and video recordings of exam locations:
Pearson VUE Test Centers:
Audio & video recordings are retained for 30 days.
Prometric Test Centers:
Audio & video recordings are retained for 120 days, with the following exceptions:
Cyprus: 20 days
Dublin and Cork: 60 days
Italy: 7 days
Rest of European Economic Area: 30 days
United Kingdom centers delivering UKV/SELT exams: 60 days
Other United Kingdom centers: 30 days
Fingerprints and palm vein scans:
Pearson VUE Test Centers:
The standard retention period is three years. When biometric data is collected, Pearson VUE retains only a template (numerical values readable by Pearson Vue systems). Once the retention period has been met, the template is obfuscated and destroyed.
Generally, during active investigations or legal activity permitted by law, this biometric data may be retained for six years or longer.
However, for candidates in Illinois, absent a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a legal requirement that takes precedence over the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), this data is purged after three years.  There are no other exceptions to the Illinois retention period.
Prometric Test Centers:
Not Applicable. F5 has opted out of the use of biometric data with Prometric.
Digital signature & photo (other than from copies of identity documents):
Pearson VUE
Test Centers:
Pearson VUE retains a photograph of the individual and a digital signature for 3 years.
Prometric Test Centers:
Prometric does not collect or retain photographs for F5 candidates. Signature data will be retained for 5 years.
Copies of identity documents
Pearson VUE
Test Centers:
For test center delivery, identity documents are not retained.
Prometric
Test Centers:
Five years from the date of the last service, test, or assessment.

Leaked Credential Check Privacy Statement
Published on: 1 October 2020
Overview
F5’s Leaked Credential Check service (the “Service”) helps customers who use BIG-IP recognize when an attempt to login to their online property has been made with a username/password pair that matches one that was stolen from an unrelated third-party property. The customer can decide how to act on this information, such as by requiring the purported user to reset their password, or requiring additional authentication from the purported user before completing a high-risk action like a gift card purchase or funds transfer. This Privacy Statement applies to the data that the Service uses.
Roles of the Parties
Under the data protection laws of the EU and similar jurisdictions, F5 is a processor of the query data that the Service receives from F5’s customer, and the customer is (or acts on behalf of) a controller of such data, to the extent it contains personal data.
The Service is powered by a proprietary corpus of hashed username/password pairs known to be compromised. To the extent this corpus constitutes personal data, F5 is its controller. The information in this corpus is sourced primarily from (i) lists of stolen username/password pairs seen on the dark web and (ii) contributions from customers or security researchers that authorize F5 to use username/password hashes for the collective defense.
Personal Data Collection and Processing by the Service
The Service will receive, as a query, hashes derived from a username and password.  The Service will then take a customer-specified action based on whether the username/password pair is known to be compromised (i.e., whether the username/password pair is reflected in the corpus of leaked credentials that powers the Service). This action could include blocking the login attempt or forwarding the user to a page where the customer takes some other action, such as requiring a password reset or additional authentication.
What to Do If Your Access to an Online Property Has Been Blocked
If you believe that the Service has improperly blocked or restricted your access to an F5 customer’s online property, please contact that customer to request restoration of your access.
More Information
To exercise your rights with respect to the query data that F5 processes when providing the Service to a customer, please contact that customer. To exercise your rights with respect to other data, you may contact F5. For more information about F5’s privacy practices, please see the

The Traffix Solutions process customer network traffic (which may contain IP addresses or other personal data) within the customer’s location — without transmitting network traffic or other personal data to F5.  F5 does not provide a cloud environment in which Traffix Solutions operate.
Customers who use support and maintenance Services may choose to provide F5 with personal data.  One way they can do this is by providing F5 with a file called a TTA file, which contains configuration details relevant to the Traffix Solution, including a sampling of its log files, which contain IP addresses.  The customer would take specific steps to generate the TTA file and manually upload it to an F5 support location.  F5 systems run an automated process that removes certain kinds of data from the file (such as portions that appear to be formatted like passwords or private keys) prior to its use for support or maintenance.
The other way a customer can provide F5 with personal data in the support and maintenance context is by taking specific steps to create, and then manually upload to F5, a different type of snapshot from the Traffix Solution’s memory cores, or a snapshot of the traffic passing through the Traffix Solution.  These snapshots typically contain IP addresses.  If the customer uses the Traffix Solution to process traffic that contains personal data, the snapshot may contain random snippets of such personal data.
On occasion, F5 customers may return a Traffix device to F5 through our Return Material Authorization (RMA) process.  F5 provides instructions to customers about how to remove their data from their devices prior to return.  If a customer does not follow this process, F5 overwrites the data after receiving the device.  F5 also offers RMA alternatives that allow customers to retain out-of-service Traffix devices while still receiving a replacement.
F5’s provision of professional services to the customer may, depending on the Services and the customer’s needs, involve incidental access by F5 personnel to the sorts of data described above.
