Shape costs money. We believe charging the customer directly is a beautiful business model that ties craftsmen and customers closer together. We don't sell data nor serve ads; instead, we charge a recurring fee for access to our apps.Shape's best features are members-only, costing $8-16 per month or $40-120 per year depending on country and currency. There may be an optional free trial. Subscriptions automatically renew, and your iTunes account is charged upon purchase. Cancel in iTunes account settings at least 24 hours before renewal. Free trials may be voided in event of purchase.
