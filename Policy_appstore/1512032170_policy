Privacy policy
We at Digital Dream Labs, INC (with its affiliates and subsidiaries, "DDL", "we", ‚Äúour‚Äù or "us") take your privacy seriously.¬† This policy explains our collection and use of information on and through our websites, products, services, apps and applications (the "Services"), and the related choices you have.¬† By using or accessing the Services, you hereby consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information as described herein.
Your use of the Services is at all times subject to the DDL Terms and Conditions, which incorporate this Privacy Policy.¬† Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms and Conditions.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.¬† We will notify you of material changes by posting a notice on our website, sending you an email, and/or by some other means.¬† If required, we may also seek your or your parent‚Äôs or guardian‚Äôs prior consent.¬† You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for changes.¬† If you use the Services after changes have been posted, then the revised Privacy Policy applies.
TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
We and the Services collect different types of information through the Services.
GENERAL INFORMATION
Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you ("Personal Information").¬† We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by any and various means.¬† For example, when you make a purchase on our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, address and billing information, etc.¬† When you register to receive DDL news, we collect your name, age and email address, etc.
SPECIFIC TO THE SERVICES
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
When you sign up for an DDL account (an "Account"), we may collect information including but not limited to your name, player/driver name, email address, birthdate, password, address, and billing information (collectively, "Account Information").¬† If a child under the age of 13 (or older, depending on your country) registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead.
We use Account Information to create, manage and maintain Accounts and provide the Services. For example, for some DDL products such as Overdrive, you may be able to reserve a driver name, which may be displayed to other users with whom you play.¬† We also back up stats and track progress on multiple devices for a better gameplay experience.¬† For purchases on our website, we collect address and billing information to facilitate your current or future purchases.
APP ANALYTICS DATA
The Services collect gameplay data such as scores, achievements, and feature usage.¬† The Services also automatically keep track of information such as events or failures within them.¬† In addition, we may collect your device make and model, an DDL-generated randomized device ID for the mobile device on which you run our apps, robot/vehicle ID of your DDL device, ZIP-code level data about your location (obtained from your IP address), operating system version, and other device-related information like battery level (collectively, "Analytics Data").¬† Unless you create an account and log in, Analytics Data is stored under a unique ID and not connected to you. We use Analytics Data to enable and improve the Services and enhance your gameplay. For example, Analytics Data enables us to analyze crashes, fix bugs, and personalize or develop new features and services. For further information, please see Section E.
We also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data, to create aggregated data which does not identify you personally ("Aggregate Data"). We may freely use and share Aggregate Data with our partners and third-parties, for example, who perform functions on our behalf or help us improve the Services.
COZMO
Cozmo connects to his app via a direct Wi-Fi connection to your mobile device.¬† Images from Cozmo's camera are processed in the Cozmo app to power his navigation and other features. They are not stored and do not leave the Cozmo app.
VECTOR
Vector has voice features.¬† When you say the wake words, ‚ÄúHey Vector‚Äù, Vector streams your voice command to the cloud, where it is processed.¬† Anonymized voice command audio may be stored and used by DDL for product and Services improvements and developments.¬† If you connect Vector with a third party voice service account, that voice service‚Äôs privacy policy applies to your interactions with that service.
Vector also has camera features.¬† When you ask Vector to take a picture, he will play a simulated shutter sound and take the shot.¬† Pictures taken by Vector are stored in an encrypted format on the robot and are not transferred to an external server or other location.¬† You can view, delete or share pictures taken by Vector from within your Vector App.
MEET COZMO AND VECTOR‚ÄôS KNOWN FACES
Both Vector and Cozmo (with the Cozmo App) can translate faces they see into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a person ("Facial Features Data").¬† Unless you either use Meet Cozmo from the Cozmo App (for Cozmo),or teach Vector your name (for Vector), Facial Features Data is discarded each time the robot goes to sleep and/or, for Cozmo, loses his connection to your mobile device.
If you use the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App, or you introduce yourself to Vector by voice, you are permitting the robot to associate the name you provide with Facial Features Data for you.¬† Facial Features Data is stored with the name you provide, and the robot uses this data to enhance and personalize your experience and do things like greet you by that name.¬† This data is stored locally on the robot and in the robot‚Äôs app.¬† It is not uploaded to DDL nor shared, and you can delete it anytime.
OTHER FEATURES
The Services provide you with options to share your information, such as via text messaging, email, or social media, or to receive push notifications from us.¬† For example, the Services can ask if you'd like to share your play results with your friends or save images from our apps to your device.¬† If you want to use these features, you will receive a request for access to your photos which you may allow or deny.¬† If granted, we use this access to save images you create within the Services.¬† For push notifications, you can opt-out anytime by turning off push notifications from your phone settings.
Our applications also request operating system permission to use wireless technology on your device.¬† For example, the Overdrive and Cozmo applications use wireless technology to communicate with DDL robots during gameplay.¬† You can turn on / off Bluetooth from your Bluetooth-compatible smartphone settings, although it may hinder your play.¬† Some of our Services work with a software development kit (SDK) that we make available to you; we will tell you if different or additional policies apply to data generated through your use of our SDK.
AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU NAVIGATE: LOG FILES, COOKIES, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
When you use or visit the Services, the services automatically record and store certain information in log files.¬† Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way.¬† If we need to combine this type of information with Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes statistical or technical information such as your Internet Protocol address, operating system, time and date, and how you navigate the Services.

Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you ("Personal Information").¬† We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by any and various means.¬† For example, when you make a purchase on our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, address and billing information, etc.¬† When you register to receive DDL news, we collect your name, age and email address, etc.
SPECIFIC TO THE SERVICES
ACCOUNT INFORMATION
When you sign up for an DDL account (an "Account"), we may collect information including but not limited to your name, player/driver name, email address, birthdate, password, address, and billing information (collectively, "Account Information").¬† If a child under the age of 13 (or older, depending on your country) registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead.
We use Account Information to create, manage and maintain Accounts and provide the Services. For example, for some DDL products such as Overdrive, you may be able to reserve a driver name, which may be displayed to other users with whom you play.¬† We also back up stats and track progress on multiple devices for a better gameplay experience.¬† For purchases on our website, we collect address and billing information to facilitate your current or future purchases.
APP ANALYTICS DATA
The Services collect gameplay data such as scores, achievements, and feature usage.¬† The Services also automatically keep track of information such as events or failures within them.¬† In addition, we may collect your device make and model, an DDL-generated randomized device ID for the mobile device on which you run our apps, robot/vehicle ID of your DDL device, ZIP-code level data about your location (obtained from your IP address), operating system version, and other device-related information like battery level (collectively, "Analytics Data").¬† Unless you create an account and log in, Analytics Data is stored under a unique ID and not connected to you. We use Analytics Data to enable and improve the Services and enhance your gameplay. For example, Analytics Data enables us to analyze crashes, fix bugs, and personalize or develop new features and services. For further information, please see Section E.
We also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data, to create aggregated data which does not identify you personally ("Aggregate Data"). We may freely use and share Aggregate Data with our partners and third-parties, for example, who perform functions on our behalf or help us improve the Services.
COZMO
Cozmo connects to his app via a direct Wi-Fi connection to your mobile device.¬† Images from Cozmo's camera are processed in the Cozmo app to power his navigation and other features. They are not stored and do not leave the Cozmo app.
VECTOR
Vector has voice features.¬† When you say the wake words, ‚ÄúHey Vector‚Äù, Vector streams your voice command to the cloud, where it is processed.¬† Anonymized voice command audio may be stored and used by DDL for product and Services improvements and developments.¬† If you connect Vector with a third party voice service account, that voice service‚Äôs privacy policy applies to your interactions with that service.
Vector also has camera features.¬† When you ask Vector to take a picture, he will play a simulated shutter sound and take the shot.¬† Pictures taken by Vector are stored in an encrypted format on the robot and are not transferred to an external server or other location.¬† You can view, delete or share pictures taken by Vector from within your Vector App.
MEET COZMO AND VECTOR‚ÄôS KNOWN FACES
Both Vector and Cozmo (with the Cozmo App) can translate faces they see into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a person ("Facial Features Data").¬† Unless you either use Meet Cozmo from the Cozmo App (for Cozmo),or teach Vector your name (for Vector), Facial Features Data is discarded each time the robot goes to sleep and/or, for Cozmo, loses his connection to your mobile device.
If you use the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App, or you introduce yourself to Vector by voice, you are permitting the robot to associate the name you provide with Facial Features Data for you.¬† Facial Features Data is stored with the name you provide, and the robot uses this data to enhance and personalize your experience and do things like greet you by that name.¬† This data is stored locally on the robot and in the robot‚Äôs app.¬† It is not uploaded to DDL nor shared, and you can delete it anytime.
OTHER FEATURES
The Services provide you with options to share your information, such as via text messaging, email, or social media, or to receive push notifications from us.¬† For example, the Services can ask if you'd like to share your play results with your friends or save images from our apps to your device.¬† If you want to use these features, you will receive a request for access to your photos which you may allow or deny.¬† If granted, we use this access to save images you create within the Services.¬† For push notifications, you can opt-out anytime by turning off push notifications from your phone settings.
Our applications also request operating system permission to use wireless technology on your device.¬† For example, the Overdrive and Cozmo applications use wireless technology to communicate with DDL robots during gameplay.¬† You can turn on / off Bluetooth from your Bluetooth-compatible smartphone settings, although it may hinder your play.¬† Some of our Services work with a software development kit (SDK) that we make available to you; we will tell you if different or additional policies apply to data generated through your use of our SDK.
AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU NAVIGATE: LOG FILES, COOKIES, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
When you use or visit the Services, the services automatically record and store certain information in log files.¬† Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way.¬† If we need to combine this type of information with Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes statistical or technical information such as your Internet Protocol address, operating system, time and date, and how you navigate the Services.
