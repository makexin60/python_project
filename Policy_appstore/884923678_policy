Information We Collect
A.
Information
We Collect from an End User:
1)
App:
When you register for the App, we require the following information: your name,
email address, telephone number, age, height, weight, and gender
2)
Product:
Our Body Composition Analysis Device collects multiple data points from your
body and outputs information such as BMI, PBF, Lean Body Mass, Skeletal Muscle
Mass, level of Body Water etc. Accessories connected to the InBody Body
Composition Analyzer may collect and output many different data points. Results
from the device and the accessory are pooled together and associated with your
registered ID and/or telephone number. If you wish to be left anonymous and
unidentifiable, you may use the Product as a Guest. Height, weight, age, and
gender are still required from a Guest user to process the data. The storage of
your data on the server allows you to track changes over multiple tests and
multiple Service(s). The guest user may not be able to track their results.
Also, depending on the model of the Product, additional body composition
measurement information may be stored, such as visceral fat level, leg lean
mass etc.
3)
Wearable
devices:  Wearable devices track your sleep, calories, activity, steps,
etc. You have the option to use different functions such as your activity time,
distance traveled, and calories burned. You may also selectively choose to hide
any of the functionalities (except battery, time, and body composition
analysis) from the screen of the Wearable device.  The Ranking system
function, derived from the Wearable device, in the App is available for you to
compare your steps and/or scores activity with your friends and family who have
this system available and turned on. This optional feature requires you to
provide access to the contacts and opt-in to share your results with your
contacts through settings. To know more about ranking system and the different
functions of the Wearable device, please refer to the “Terms of Service for End
User”.
4)

pertains to the Personal Information that you share about yourself to InBody
using InBody’s Service directly, without an Analysis Facility, you agree that
no Protected Health Information is included, and that HIPAA does not apply to
such Personal Information.
B.
Information
We collect from an Analysis Facility:
An
Analysis Facility may be asked to provide InBody with Personal Information of
Facility Users who may access the Site. Such information can include their full
name, telephone number, email address, and date of birth. The Staff member is a
sub-tier account to the Admin account with limited access to the Site.
Each Analysis Facility may have a different staff
structure, and the level of access to the End User’s information, will be
determined by InBody at our sole discretion by reference to the Facility User's
responsibility and role at the Analysis Facility. A Facility User’s personal
information is used to create account logins for the Site during the creation
of an Administrator account and/or Staff member account. The Facility User is
responsible for the accuracy of the information, any changes or updates on the
account, and the confidentiality of the login credentials for the Site. A Facility
User may be asked to provide identifiable information to InBody if they call in
for support.

Data Retention and Deletion
We
and our affiliates actively retain Personal Information for ten years for our
relationship for the purposes described above or as permitted or required by
federal law. Aggregation of data will take place after ten years of your
inactivity. Your Personal Information is aggregated when you are inactive on
the App AND have not used the Product for ten years. When your information is
aggregated, your Protected Health Information, name, ID, phone number, and
email address, is deleted permanently. Only the de-identifiable information is
kept for development, improvement, and/or marketing purposes. Inactivity is
defined by two requirements:
1)
When you
are inactive (have not logged in) on the App
2)
When you
have not used the Product at the Facility
Inactivity
or cancellation of the subscription by the Analysis Facility from the Product
or the Service does not impact your access to previous test results or the test
results produced by InBody wearable products. If you are continuously using the
Product, your information will be retained until you become inactive for ten
years or delete the information by making a request to the Facility.
Data
can be deleted (i) if an Administrator of the Site deletes the data or account
on the Site; or (ii) if you manually delete the test results on the App (which
does not mean that data has been deleted on the Facility’s Site).
To
delete your Personal Information permanently, you must talk to your
Administrator or Staff Member to delete your information. Analysis Facility has
Custody and Control over data that was acquired at their Facility. However, if
you do not have a Facility and you use personal or home use device(s)
independently, you may delete your test results or withdraw your account to
permanently delete your account and information therein.
Deleting
records and Personal Information is permanent; however, please note that in
some cases we may be required to retain certain information where permitted or
required by law, including without limitation if such information is the
subject of a legal dispute. InBody Co., Ltd. may wait for a certain time before
permanently deleting your records or Personal Information in order to help
avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information.
A.
Backups
A Backup is defined
as data stored that matches the data on the Analysis Facility’s Product(s). The
Backup will be maintained for the duration of the End User account or
LookinBody Web active account until data is permanently deleted from the
account. Data may be stored in the Backup even after someone deletes an End
User account or information to avoid accidental or malicious deletion of your
information. After a reasonable time period has passed, the data will be
deleted permanently or restored if requested. After the data is deleted
permanently, the Backup will be deleted, subject to any legal requirements.
VIII.
Data Accuracy
InBody
works hard to ensure that the information within its Custody and Control is
accurate. Nevertheless, the End User should be vigilant of the accuracy of
their own Personal Information. The method for updating Personal Information
depends on the information source. Personal Information comes from one of the following:
1)
Entered
by you on the App or the Product
2)
Entered
by the Analysis Facility on the Site or the Product
Information
you delete, update, or add on the App is stored only on your phone, viewable to
you,
a
nd will impact your manually
inputted test results, Personal Use device, and Wearable device results. It is
in our Custody but Controlled by you. If you wish to update your Personal
Information on any other device you should consult your Analysis Facility or
update it yourself on the device. To update your personal information on the
Site, make a request to the Facility User. Understand that any change to your
Personal Information will not impact your previous tests.
Any
factors of the Personal Information that are dynamic (changes frequently) for
example Weight, Age or Phone Number, should be updated by you or the Analysis
Facility accordingly. As the Analysis Facility and you have full authority to
change or update any part of the Personal Information, InBody and its
affiliates do not take responsibility for test results and/or decisions made,
based on the inaccurate Personal Information.
IX.

III. Information We Collect
1. Information We Collect from an End User:
App: When you register for the App, we require the following information: your name, email address, telephone number, age, height, weight, and gender
Product: Our Body Composition Analysis Device collects multiple data points from your body and outputs information such as BMI, PBF, Lean Body Mass, Skeletal Muscle Mass, level of Body Water etc. Accessories connected to the InBody Body Composition Analyzer may collect and output many different data points. Results from the device and the accessory are pooled together and associated with your registered ID and/or telephone number. If you wish to be left anonymous and unidentifiable, you may use the Product as a Guest. Height, weight, age, and gender are still required from a Guest user to process the data. The storage of your data on the server allows you to track changes over multiple tests and multiple Service(s). The guest user may not be able to track their results. Also, depending on the model of the Product, additional body composition measurement information may be stored, such as visceral fat level, leg lean mass etc.
Wearable devices: Wearable devices track your sleep, calories, activity, steps, etc. You have the option to use different functions such as your activity time, distance traveled, and calories burned. You may also selectively choose to hide any of the functionalities (except battery, time, and body composition analysis) from the screen of the Wearable device.  The Ranking system function, derived from the Wearable device, in the App is available for you to compare your steps and/or scores activity with your friends and family who have this system available and turned on. This optional feature requires you to provide access to the contacts and opt-in to share your results with your contacts through settings. To know more about ranking system and the different functions of the Wearable device, please refer to the “Terms of Service for End User”.
As it pertains to the Personal Information that you share about yourself to InBody using InBody’s Service directly, without an Analysis Facility, you agree that no Protected Health Information is included, and that HIPAA does not apply to such Personal Information.
2. Information We collect from an Analysis Facility:
An Analysis Facility may be asked to provide InBody with Personal Information of Facility Users who may access the Site. Such information can include their full name, telephone number, email address, and date of birth. The Staff member is a sub-tier account to the Admin account with limited access to the Site. Each Analysis Facility may have a different staff structure, and the level of access to the End User’s information, will be determined by InBody at our sole discretion by reference to the Facility User’s responsibility and role at the Analysis Facility. A Facility User’s personal information is used to create account logins for the Site during the creation of an Administrator account and/or Staff member account. The Facility User is responsible for the accuracy of the information, any changes or updates on the account, and the confidentiality of the login credentials for the Site. A Facility User may be asked to provide identifiable information to InBody if they call in for support.

Your consent denotes that you have read the Policy in its entirety and understand the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in our organization.
In most cases, you have the ability to withdraw your consent. However, because of regulatory requirements imposed upon us, or contractual obligations you have with us, there are certain limited circumstances where you may not withdraw your consent to the collection, use or sharing of your Personal Information. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, or where you have withdrawn your consent, we may not be able to offer you the Services or information that you requested or that could be offered to you. For example, if you withdraw your consent to use Personal Information such as weight, height, or gender, it will be impossible for the InBody Body Composition Analysis Device to test your composition.

Contact relating to Service inquiries or repairs
Requests for disclosure for legitimate legal reasons
When necessary to protect life, health, property or other vital interests of the End User
When a transfer of Personal Information is judged necessary to continue service in the event of changes to the service provider for example: a company merger
Other disclosures required or permitted by applicable law.
VII. Data Retention and Deletion
We and our affiliates actively retain Personal Information for ten years for our relationship for the purposes described above or as permitted or required by federal law. Aggregation of data will take place after ten years of your inactivity. Your Personal Information is aggregated when you are inactive on the App AND have not used the Product for ten years. When your information is aggregated, your Protected Health Information, name, ID, phone number, and email address, is deleted permanently. Only the de-identifiable information is kept for development, improvement, and/or marketing purposes. Inactivity is defined by two requirements:
When you are inactive (have not logged in) on the App
When you have not used the Product at the Facility
Inactivity or cancellation of the subscription by the Analysis Facility from the Product or the Service does not impact your access to previous test results or the test results produced by InBody wearable products. If you are continuously using the Product, your information will be retained until you become inactive for ten years or delete the information by making a request to the Facility.
Data can be deleted (i) if an Administrator of the Site deletes the data or account on the Site; or (ii) if you manually delete the test results on the App (which does not mean that data has been deleted on the Facility’s Site).
To delete your Personal Information permanently, you must talk to your Administrator or Staff Member to delete your information. Analysis Facility has Custody and Control over data that was acquired at their Facility. However, if you do not have a Facility and you use personal or home use device(s) independently, you may delete your test results or withdraw your account to permanently delete your account and information therein.
Deleting records and Personal Information is permanent; however, please note that in some cases we may be required to retain certain information where permitted or required by law, including without limitation if such information is the subject of a legal dispute. InBody Co., Ltd. may wait for a certain time before permanently deleting your records or Personal Information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your information.
Backups:
A Backup is defined as data stored that matches the data on the Analysis Facility’s Product(s). The Backup will be maintained for the duration of the End User account or LookinBody Web active account until data is permanently deleted from the account. Data may be stored in the Backup even after someone deletes an End User account or information to avoid accidental or malicious deletion of your information. After a reasonable time period has passed, the data will be deleted permanently or restored if requested. After the data is deleted permanently, the Backup will be deleted, subject to any legal requirements.
VIII. Data Accuracy
InBody works hard to ensure that the information within its Custody and Control is accurate. Nevertheless, the End User should be vigilant of the accuracy of their own Personal Information. The method for updating Personal Information depends on the information source. Personal Information comes from one of the following:
Entered by you on the App or the Product
Entered by the Analysis Facility on the Site or the Product
Information you delete, update, or add on the App is stored only on your phone, viewable to you, and will impact your manually inputted test results, Personal Use device, and Wearable device results. It is in our Custody but Controlled by you. If you wish to update your Personal Information on any other device you should consult your Analysis Facility or update it yourself on the device. To update your personal information on the Site, make a request to the Facility User. Understand that any change to your Personal Information will not impact your previous tests.
Any factors of the Personal Information that are dynamic (changes frequently) for example Weight, Age or Phone Number, should be updated by you or the Analysis Facility accordingly. As the Analysis Facility and you have full authority to change or update any part of the Personal Information, InBody and its affiliates do not take responsibility for test results and/or decisions made, based on the inaccurate Personal Information.
IX. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information
You and the Analysis Facility have full authority to add, update, or delete any part of your Personal Information. Yet you may request access or correction of your Personal Information to us. To access or request correction of your Personal Information, please contact us at
Info@InBody.com
. We may require you to verify your identity before allowing you to access your Personal Information. We may decline your access because of security or legal reasons but you can submit a written request to us and we will try to address the issues as soon as possible.
X. Children’s Privacy
We are mindful that the Services will be attractive and of benefit to potential users under the age of 18 or local age of majority and it is our policy, regardless of the country in which the Analysis Facility is located, to ensure that parents or legal guardians can monitor data collected in respect of such users. Our Service(s) is available to End Users who are below the age of 18 or local age of majority. The parent or legal guardian of any End User aged below 18 years of age is required to consent to the collection and use of his/her child’s Personal Information and Personal Health Information at the time of registering and use of our Services. When you consent to this Policy, if applicable, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information and Personal Health Information of your child. A parent or legal guardian of any child who has not attained 18 years of age or local age of majority can review his/her child’s Personal Information and Personal Health Information, ask to have it deleted, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information from the Analysis Facility.
XI. Safeguards
We work very hard to protect the data you provide. We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the data you submit, including physical, organizational, and technological security measures. Furthermore, we promise to never sell your Personal Information. Please be aware, however, that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses, and intrusions from others. By accepting this Policy, the End User and Analysis Facility each acknowledge that unintentional data loss may occur despite the efforts made in good faith by InBody, its third-party affiliates, or an Analysis Facility.
