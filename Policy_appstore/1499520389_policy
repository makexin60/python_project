COPPA COMPLIANCE (FOR CHILDREN

Protecting children's privacy
online is extremely important to Bitzardry. Bitzardry’s Website, Apps and
Services are intended for general audience and Bitzardry does not knowingly
collect any Personal Information as the term is defined under the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). The COPPA is a federal legislation
that applies to entities that collect and store Personal Information from
children under the age of 13. We are committed to ensure compliance with COPPA.
Our Website, Apps, and Platform are not meant for use by children under the age
of 13.
When Users identify themselves as
children (i.e. under the age of 13 or under the minimum age in the relevant
territory), consistent with applicable law we will: (1) not provide a path for
them to input Personal Information, (2) collect certain information for limited
purposes only (consistent with applicable law), (3) block or restrict the child
from accessing relevant services (such as chat functionality); and/or (4)
obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their
children's Personal Information.
Through our Apps your child will
be able to receive local in-app notifications, which do not collect any
Personal Information.
Please note that if you grant
consent for your child to use Bitzardry's Platform on our Website or on the
Apps, this may include such general audience communication services as email,
instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to
communicate with, and disclose Personal Information to, other Users of all
ages.

revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your
child or have that information deleted, please contact the Bitzardry support by

Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this Privacy
Policy. If we make material changes to how we use, collect, or share your child's
Personal Information, we will notify parents by email or by providing a
notification on the Platform in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for
the new uses of your child's Personal Information. We encourage you to talk
with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing Personal
Information online. Under no circumstances do we condition a child's
participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more
Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the
activity. On certain Apps, we may not permit children to participate at all
regardless of having their parental consent. If you would like to know more

Who are Google’s partners?
Google works with businesses and organizations in a variety of ways. We refer to these businesses and organizations as “partners”. For example, over 2 million non-Google websites and apps
partner with Google to show ads
. Millions of developer partners publish their apps on Google Play. Other partners help Google with securing our services; information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
Note we also work with trusted businesses as “data processors” rather than partners, meaning they process information on our behalf, to support our services, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. The Google
Privacy Policy
has more information about how we use data processors.
We don’t share information that personally identifies you with our advertising partners, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to share it. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.
You can read more about the information Google collects, including from partners, in the
Privacy Policy
