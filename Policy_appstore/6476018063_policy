We are required by law to tell you what information we collect from you, why we collect it, how we use it, under what circumstances we may share it with third parties, how we protect that information, and how you may opt out of the sale of that information. As a preliminary matter, we handle all private information you provide us with the utmost confidentiality. Your personal information will be shared with members of our Company who need to know this information in order for us to provide Services to you.

The use of this functionality may involve the third-party site or application providing information to us. For example, we may provide links on the Site or other Services to facilitate sending a communication from the Site or other Services, or we may use third parties to facilitate emails or postings to social media (like a “Share” or “Forward” button). These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites, applications, or other services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should read the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site or other Services. Please also see our

for further information.

Examples of such disclosures include using a payment processor, a cloud service provider, an email marketing provider, or entities that handle other business functions for us.
Finally, we also may share your information, including your Personal Information, with our affiliates and third parties, such as companies with whom we have marketing or other relationships, for direct marketing purposes, such as webinars or other matters of interest to you. (If you are a California resident, you have the right to request additional information regarding the “sale” of your information. Please see the section entitled “Your California Privacy Rights” below about these rights.) In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described in this Privacy Policy.
5. Ads and Information About You
You may see certain ads on our Services because we may participate in advertising networks administered by third parties. These networks track your online activities over time and across third-party websites and online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the Tracking Technologies described above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The information they collect may include information about your interactions with our Services, such as the pages you have viewed. This collection and ad targeting may take place both on our Services and on third-party websites and/or applications that participate in the ad network(s). This process also may help us track the effectiveness of our communications and marketing efforts.
6. Your Choices About the Information We Collect
If you would like to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict, or delete your personal information, object to or opt out of the processing of personal information, or withdraw your consent (which will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to the withdrawal), you may contact us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
In your request, please make clear what personal information you would like to have changed or whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database.

7. Children’s Privacy
The Site and other Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18.

If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 18 who you believe has provided her or his information to us, please contact us at
hello@jubileemedia.com

8. Do Not Track Disclosures
Do Not Track (“
DNT
”) is a web browser setting that requests that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals), but there is no universally-agreed upon standard for what a company should do when it detects a DNT signal. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.
You can learn more about Do Not Track here.
9. Visitors to the Services Outside of the United States

You provide us with your information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below.
13. International Data Transfers
Because Company works with global companies and technologies, we may transfer your Personal Information outside of the country in which it was originally provided. This may include transfers to third parties such as service providers or affiliated entities who are located outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, where data protection laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the U.S., U.K., E.U., or “EEA” (defined below). When we transfer personal data outside of these areas, we take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Information.
14. Your Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation

EEA
”). We adopted this section to comply with European privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”). Any terms defined in the GDPR have the same meaning when used in this section.
Under applicable law, we are considered the “data controller” of the personal information we handle under this Notice. In other words, we are responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose this information, subject to applicable law.

Such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us.
• We will send you information by email on our new services or other promotions only with your consent or if you otherwise opt-in to receiving those communications.

Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, unless we have your consent or those activities are otherwise required or permitted by law. You have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests, as further described below.
(b) Retention of Personal Information

In addition, if we have de-identified or anonymized data about you, we are not required to re-identify or otherwise link your identity to that data if it is not otherwise maintained that way in our records.
(c) Right to Delete Personal Information
You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information about you that we have collected from you.
As permitted by the CCPA/CPRA, if you request deletion of Personal Information that we have collected about you, we, our service providers, and our contractors may be unable to comply with such a request if your Personal Information is necessary to:
• Complete the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between us and you;
• Prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
• Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
• Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another Consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;
• Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code;
• Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of that information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement to such research, if you have provided informed consent;
• Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us;
• Comply with a legal obligation; or
• Otherwise use your Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.
(d) Right to Correct Personal Information
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate information that we maintain about you.
(e) Right to Opt-Out
As a California resident, you also have the right, at any time, to tell us not to sell Personal Information – this is called the “right to opt-out” of the sale of Personal Information. At this time, we do not sell consumers’ personal information to third parties.
(f) Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA/CPRA, we will not:
• Deny you goods or services.
• Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
• Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
• Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA/CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA/CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
