Alarm.com's Privacy Policy (United States)
Our Privacy Mission
Alarm.com Incorporated (
"Alarm.com," "we,"
or
"us"
) cares about the privacy of the information we collect about you.  This Privacy Policy explains how and when we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information and the rights and choices you can exercise in relation to your personal information.
1. Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you if you reside in the United States or its territories. If you are a resident of a country other than the United States, you can
click here
to access the Alarm.com privacy policy specific to your country. Please note that your use of this Alarm.com website (
"Website"
), wherever you reside, is subject to our
Website Terms and Conditions.
Alarm.com collects and stores certain information from or about you that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you (
"Personal Information"
). We collect Personal Information through your use of (i) Alarm.com’s websites or mobile applications, including this Website and the Alarm.com mobile application (collectively, the
"User Interfaces"
), and (ii) any combination of products and services either provided to you or accessed via any User Interface (collectively, the
"Services"
).
End-Users of the Services
The Services are provided by licensed and authorized service providers (referred to as
"Authorized Service Providers"
) which independently sell and provide the Services to their customers (
"End-Users"
). If you are an End-User, then Alarm.com acts as a data processor and collects your Personal Information on behalf of your Authorized Service Provider when you use the Services, log into your account through the User Interfaces, or otherwise provide Personal Information to us regarding your account. You should also refer to your Authorized Service Provider’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
Website Visitors and Other Individuals
If you are (i) not an existing End-User of the Services or are not logged into your account and use one of our User Interfaces (a
"Visitor"
) or (ii) providing Personal Information to us through the User Interfaces, email or phone, then Alarm.com processes your Personal Information while acting as a data controller.
2. When We Collect Personal Information
When You Provide Personal Information Directly to Us
When you (i) use the User Interfaces or the Services as a Visitor or End-User, (ii) participate in our marketing campaigns (including contests, promotions, or other activities), (iii) contact us for support, or (iv) otherwise communicate with us (including by phone, email, text, or online live chat), you may directly provide us with Personal Information.
When Your Authorized Service Provider Provides Personal Information Directly to Us
When you are an End-User of the Services, your Authorized Service Provider may directly provide us with Personal Information about your account, such as its features, settings and devices, in order to personalize and customize the Services for you.
When Personal Information is Collected Through Your Use of the User Interfaces or Services
When you use the User Interfaces or Services, Personal Information may be collected by automated means, such as through cookies and analytics on the User Interfaces. It may also be created and collected through your use of the Services, such as event history, device usage and saved video clips. We receive this Personal Information from the devices on your account, such as security sensors, thermostats and video cameras, and your computer, mobile phone or other electronic devices through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a
"Personal Device"
). We may also receive and process such Personal Information from third parties.
3. Types of Personal Information We Collect
Identifiers
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as a visitor or End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account: name, home or business address, phone number, email address, home or business size, zip code, device names, and other identifying account or user information.
Account and Device Information
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as an End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account:  account creation date, home or business system configuration, features enabled, service packages, IP addresses, device IDs, account and device settings, modes, automation settings, and device usage and performance (electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs).
Location-based Information
Some features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, and other location-based Services through your Personal Devices (collectively, "
GeoServices
"), use location information.  When you subscribe to the GeoServices and enable location-based features, we will automatically collect and store location information provided by your Personal Devices, such as mobile phones, GPS devices, or connected vehicle devices. This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited.
Video and Audio
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s video Services, (ii) use a Personal Device that is capable of recording video and/or audio (such as a video doorbell or camera), or (iii) subscribe to emergency two-way voice services, you are enabling us, certain of our third-party service providers, our affiliates and subsidiaries, or your central station, to record, store, view and process video and/or audio live streams and saved recordings from your Personal Devices. This may include capturing and sending you portions of video or audio recordings as part of a notification or analyzing the video or audio live streams or recordings to identify motion, send you alerts, or trigger alarm or other events. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings.
Data protection and privacy laws may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. You, not Alarm.com, are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or business that they may be recorded using cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with these laws.
Biometric Information
In certain circumstances, our Services may include video cameras or other cameras capable of collecting  the facial geometry or measurements ("
Biometric Information
") of individuals captured in the camera’s field of view. We collect Biometric Information when an End-User (i) enables a feature that includes facial recognition or (ii) otherwise consents to the collection of biometric information. We may also collect Biometric Information from video cameras deployed in certain commercial business settings.  Any Biometric Information we collect is used solely to provide the Services for which such information was collected or to develop and improve our Services or the services of our affiliates and subsidiaries.  We do not sell Biometric Information to third parties.
Connected Vehicle Services Information
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s connected vehicle Services, such as Connected Car and Connected Fleet, and (ii) enable a Connected Car device by plugging the device into a vehicle, we may collect information about how a connected vehicle is performing, how it is driven, and where it is located.  This may include capturing the following categories of Personal Information from or about a connected vehicle:
Driver behavior information such as braking habits, seatbelt use and vehicle speed.
Vehicle information such as VIN, battery life, and whether your Connected Car device is plugged in.
Geolocation information (including the precise geolocation of the vehicle).
Any information you choose to provide such as driver’s license information or specific information about the vehicle.
Telephone Conversations and Calls
Calls to and from our customer service and support lines may be recorded and monitored, including by our employees, vendors, and artificial intelligence and similar technologies. In addition, we use a suite of technology solutions to assist with and to analyze telephone calls made to us and online chats.  These solutions may record callers’ voices and conversations, transcribe telephone conversations, use artificial intelligence to identify, authenticate and assist callers, and/or evaluate and make recommendations.  Many of these technology solutions and applications include software and related technology from vendors or other third parties, and we may share the data collected during calls and communications with these third-party entities.  By using our services, including telephone and website communications, you accept and consent to our collection of such data (including personal data) and to our sharing that data with others.
Other Information Collected via Chatbots
We use chatbots powered by third-party providers on our User Interfaces to provide you with information and support. When you interact with a chatbot on the User Interfaces, all the information you choose to provide to the chatbot may be collected and associated with your name or your IP address and a transcript of your interactions or communications with or through the chatbot may be created and stored.  You should not enter any information into the chatbot that you would not want saved, recorded, or monitored.  By using or interacting with a chatbot on our User Interfaces, you understand that you are communicating with automated self-service software provided by one of our third-party providers or communicating with our representative through one of our third-party providers; in either case, your communications may be saved, recorded, or monitored by us or our third-party provider.  You also consent to our and our third-party providers’ collecting, monitoring, recording, and managing any information (including Personal Information) that you enter into the chatbot or generate by using or interacting with the chatbot. We and our third-party providers may also collect, monitor, record and manage certain device and usage information automatically, including information collected in connection with the chatbot via cookies and other tracking technologies.  Our third-party chatbot providers include Salesforce (Privacy Statement:
https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/full_privacy/
) and ZoomInfo (Privacy Policy:
https://www.zoominfo.com/legal/privacy-policy
). For more information about how our third-party providers may collect, use, or disclose your information obtained by using or interacting with the chatbot, please read their privacy policies.

When you are an End-User of the Services, your Authorized Service Provider may directly provide us with Personal Information about your account, such as its features, settings and devices, in order to personalize and customize the Services for you.
When Personal Information is Collected Through Your Use of the User Interfaces or Services
When you use the User Interfaces or Services, Personal Information may be collected by automated means, such as through cookies and analytics on the User Interfaces. It may also be created and collected through your use of the Services, such as event history, device usage and saved video clips. We receive this Personal Information from the devices on your account, such as security sensors, thermostats and video cameras, and your computer, mobile phone or other electronic devices through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a
"Personal Device"
). We may also receive and process such Personal Information from third parties.
3. Types of Personal Information We Collect
Identifiers
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as a visitor or End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account: name, home or business address, phone number, email address, home or business size, zip code, device names, and other identifying account or user information.
Account and Device Information
When you use the User Interfaces or Services as an End-User, we may collect the following from you or other users on your account:  account creation date, home or business system configuration, features enabled, service packages, IP addresses, device IDs, account and device settings, modes, automation settings, and device usage and performance (electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs).
Location-based Information
Some features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, and other location-based Services through your Personal Devices (collectively, "
GeoServices
"), use location information.  When you subscribe to the GeoServices and enable location-based features, we will automatically collect and store location information provided by your Personal Devices, such as mobile phones, GPS devices, or connected vehicle devices. This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited.
Video and Audio
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s video Services, (ii) use a Personal Device that is capable of recording video and/or audio (such as a video doorbell or camera), or (iii) subscribe to emergency two-way voice services, you are enabling us, certain of our third-party service providers, our affiliates and subsidiaries, or your central station, to record, store, view and process video and/or audio live streams and saved recordings from your Personal Devices. This may include capturing and sending you portions of video or audio recordings as part of a notification or analyzing the video or audio live streams or recordings to identify motion, send you alerts, or trigger alarm or other events. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings.
Data protection and privacy laws may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. You, not Alarm.com, are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or business that they may be recorded using cameras and other devices with audio and video recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with these laws.
Biometric Information
In certain circumstances, our Services may include video cameras or other cameras capable of collecting  the facial geometry or measurements ("
Biometric Information
") of individuals captured in the camera’s field of view. We collect Biometric Information when an End-User (i) enables a feature that includes facial recognition or (ii) otherwise consents to the collection of biometric information. We may also collect Biometric Information from video cameras deployed in certain commercial business settings.  Any Biometric Information we collect is used solely to provide the Services for which such information was collected or to develop and improve our Services or the services of our affiliates and subsidiaries.  We do not sell Biometric Information to third parties.

When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com’s connected vehicle Services, such as Connected Car and Connected Fleet, and (ii) enable a Connected Car device by plugging the device into a vehicle, we may collect information about how a connected vehicle is performing, how it is driven, and where it is located.  This may include capturing the following categories of Personal Information from or about a connected vehicle:
Driver behavior information such as braking habits, seatbelt use and vehicle speed.
Vehicle information such as VIN, battery life, and whether your Connected Car device is plugged in.
Geolocation information (including the precise geolocation of the vehicle).
Any information you choose to provide such as driver’s license information or specific information about the vehicle.
Telephone Conversations and Calls
Calls to and from our customer service and support lines may be recorded and monitored, including by our employees, vendors, and artificial intelligence and similar technologies. In addition, we use a suite of technology solutions to assist with and to analyze telephone calls made to us and online chats.  These solutions may record callers’ voices and conversations, transcribe telephone conversations, use artificial intelligence to identify, authenticate and assist callers, and/or evaluate and make recommendations.  Many of these technology solutions and applications include software and related technology from vendors or other third parties, and we may share the data collected during calls and communications with these third-party entities.  By using our services, including telephone and website communications, you accept and consent to our collection of such data (including personal data) and to our sharing that data with others.
Other Information Collected via Chatbots
We use chatbots powered by third-party providers on our User Interfaces to provide you with information and support. When you interact with a chatbot on the User Interfaces, all the information you choose to provide to the chatbot may be collected and associated with your name or your IP address and a transcript of your interactions or communications with or through the chatbot may be created and stored.

We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.
Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.

For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.
Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites.

While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
4.5 Social Media Features
Our websites may use social media features, such as the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.
Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

”) understands that you care about how information about you is used. This Privacy Policy (the “
Policy
”) explains how we collect information pertaining to businesses and business people (“
Business Information
”) and all other types of information, including personal information, through our online services (the “
Services
”), website, and mobile applications (collectively with the Services, the “
Site
”); how we maintain, use, and share that information; and how you can manage the way information about you is handled.
“
ZoomInfo
” for purposes of this Privacy Policy includes ZoomInfo Technologies LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its affiliates.
For individuals residing in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, please

I. Introduction
This brief summary of certain information in this Policy is intended to help you quickly understand what ZoomInfo is, how you can opt out of our database, and the potential outcomes of remaining in our database.
ZoomInfo collects business contact and similar information related to individuals when they are working in their professional or employment capacity and uses this information to create professional profiles of individuals and profiles of businesses. We provide this information to our customers, who are businesses trying to reach business professionals for their own business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities.
You can opt out of our database by visiting our
Privacy Center
. At the Privacy Center you can also submit an access request or claim your professional profile and update your profile information. Using the Privacy Center is the quickest and easiest way to access your information or have it deleted or corrected. However, if you prefer to email or call us, our contact information is listed under the “Contact Us” section at the end of this Policy.
By remaining in our database, you may be contacted by our customers when they are conducting their business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities. Communications you receive from our customers may be relevant to your profession or employment role, but we cannot guarantee that you will find such communications to be relevant or of interest to you.
II. How We Collect Information
ZoomInfo collects data about people and companies through multiple channels, including the web, information provided by our users and customers, information licensed from other companies, and research from our in-house research team. Click on each dropdown below to learn more about how we collect information and the types of information we collect.
A. Where does ZoomInfo get the Business Information for its Professional and Business Profiles?
ZoomInfo creates profiles of companies (“
Business Profiles
”) and individuals in their professional capacity (“
Professional Profiles
”). Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we may combine multiple data points regarding a single person or company into a Professional or Business Profile. The resulting directory of Professional and Business Profiles (the “
Directory
”) is then made available to the users of the Site, our customers, and our partners. Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address (including business and/or other email addresses, such as “freemails” like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Professional Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual’s social media profiles.
ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Professional and Business Profiles in several ways, including:
Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly available information.
We license information from other companies.
Our users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies.
Through market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team.
ZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the “
Public Directory
”). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include, but are not limited to, past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, previous professional experience, professional memberships and affiliations, education information, and/or web links to articles recently written by or about the featured individual.
B. How does ZoomInfo Lite (formerly Community Edition) and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work?
ZoomInfo offers a service called
ZoomInfo Lite
(formerly “Community Edition”). When subscribing to ZoomInfo Lite, a user may install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the “
Software
”) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user’s email account. If a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user’s computer uses to manage the user’s email and contacts, known as an “email client” (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user’s computer’s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives credits for use on ZoomInfo Lite at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at
/legal/ce-terms-conditions
). A user may also access ZoomInfo Lite without providing ZoomInfo such information from their email by signing up with their email address instead of connecting their Google or Office 365 account directly. Such users will receive fewer monthly credits than a user contributing Business Information as described above.
Information that may be collected from the user’s email client includes the following, if available:
Name
Email address
Job title and department
Phone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers)
Company name
Postal address of company
Business-related postal address of person
Corporate website URLs
Social media URLs
Metadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information
Email addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders
To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps:
Business Information Only – Emails sent to ZoomInfo Lite users from consumer-oriented email services (or “freemails”) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded.
Unattributed – We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See “Disclosures to Service Providers,” “Disclosures for Legal Reasons,” and “Disclosures to a Buyer of the Company”)
Opt-Out – Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, our toll-free number, or by writing to us at the Contact Us address below. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law.
ZoomInfo does not “read” the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client.
Information extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account through the user’s email account settings. Information that has previously been shared with ZoomInfo cannot be unshared by disabling the Software.
C. How does ZoomInfo handle customer information?
Customer Information Collected.
ZoomInfo may collect the following information from or regarding its customers: (1) personal contact information regarding users of the Services (“
User Information
”); (2) information uploaded or otherwise provided to our system by a user of the Services (“
Uploaded Information
”); (3) usage logs regarding the use of the Site and Services, including logins and other actions taken, time stamps, IP address, device or other ID, and other usage data (“
Usage Logs
”); and (4) any other information from or relating to users of our Services (“
Related Information
”) (collectively, “
Customer Information
”).
Certain users may be provided access to the Services through a company’s license agreement. Such company may require that one or more administrators have global rights to access any and all information of every user who accesses the Services through that company’s ZoomInfo account. Questions or concerns regarding the rights of other individuals in your company to access your information should be addressed to your company.
Use of Customer Information
. Customer Information may be used for ZoomInfo’s legitimate business interests in connection with a customer or its users’ use of the Site, including to respond to user inquiries and fulfill user requests, complete transactions, provide customer service, send administrative information, and to personalize user experience with the Site. We may use Customer Information to better our understanding of our users in general and to test, develop, improve, and enhance our Services and Site. We may use Customer Information to contact customers or their users in the future about services, promotions, opportunities, and other general information about ZoomInfo. We may use Customer Information to investigate and prosecute potential breaches of ZoomInfo’s security or license agreements.
ZoomInfo will not disclose Customer Information to any third party except in connection with a legitimate use as set forth in this Policy, in connection with a bona fide legal dispute to which such information is relevant, in response to valid, compulsory legal process, in response to a valid data subject request where required by applicable law, or as otherwise required by law. ZoomInfo will, whenever possible, obtain confidentiality agreements from any service provider to whom Customer Information is disclosed and ensure any recipient service providers are committed to employing appropriate technological security measures.
ZoomInfo employs reasonable security and back-up procedures to protect Customer Information. However, in the unlikely event there is a loss or corruption of Customer Information, ZoomInfo is not responsible or liable for such loss or corruption. We encourage our users to retain copies of all Uploaded Information on their own system.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (
GPC
), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).
Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the
GPC
specification.

GPC

Test against the reference server
The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).

Date of issue:  September 1, 2021
Scope
If you are a resident of the EEA (specifically, any country in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland) or a resident of the United Kingdom ("UK") or a resident of Switzerland, this Privacy Notice to Data Subjects in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland ("Privacy Notice") explains what personal data we collect about you, how it is used, with whom it is shared, and rights you may exercise in relation to your personal data.
This Privacy Notice applies to our privacy practices for your use of (i) this website and any mobile sites or applications operated by Alarm.com, including the Alarm.com application, (the "User Interfaces") and (ii) any combination of Alarm.com's products and services purchased or accessed via any User Interface (the "Services"), and all personal data we directly receive or collect from you in the course of doing business.  Alarm.com's business address is 8281 Greensboro Drive, Suite 100, Tysons, VA 22102 USA.
Alarm.com's Services are provided by licensed and authorized service providers ("Authorized Service Providers"). If you are a customer of an Authorized Service Provider, your information will be processed by Alarm.com acting as a data processor and your Authorized Service Provider will remain responsible for the handling of any personal information it collects from you and for compliance with any applicable data protection and/or privacy laws.  You should refer to the Authorized Service Providers' privacy notice for more information on the Authorized Service Providers' privacy practices.
Data Collection and Use
Data You Provide to Us
If you are an owner, agent, or employee of an existing or prospective Authorized Service Provider, you may provide us with personal data when you register with Alarm.com, engage with customer support or marketing, and transact business with Alarm.com.
If you are an existing or prospective customer of an Authorized Service Provider, you may provide us with personal data when you set up your account with Alarm.com and use Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services.
We may use this information for our business operations, to communicate with you or your Authorized Service Provider (as applicable), to comply with the law, and to protect the security and integrity of the User Interfaces and Services.
Data We Collect and Process on Behalf of Authorized Service Providers
When using the User Interfaces, you may provide us with personal data including, but not limited to, your name, home or business address, phone number, email address, location, or zip code.
When using our Services, you or your Authorized Service Provider may provide us with certain additional information (e.g., unit description, home or business size, home or business system configuration, sensor names, appliances or other devices monitored by Alarm.com, account information, schedule, mode, automation settings, and device settings) in order to help us personalize your Services.  Alarm.com may also receive personal data that you have provided to our partners, including emergency contact information and user profile information, to enable Alarm.com to provide our Services.
On behalf of you or your Authorized Service Provider, Alarm.com may process information regarding your use of the Alarm.com Services, including but not limited to: performance of any security or other device monitored by Alarm.com, electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs. We receive this type of information from your devices that are monitored by Alarm.com and your computer or other electronic device through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a "Personal Device"), and we may also receive and collect such information from third parties.
Alarm.com will process all personal data received by Authorized Service Providers via contractual arrangements and may use compiled aggregate statistics about the User Interfaces and Services to improve our Services.
Location-based Information
Some features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, vehicle diagnostics, and other location-based Services (collectively, "GeoServices"), use location information. Before certain GeoServices information can be used, you must first opt-in to activate these Services. If you enable these features, we will automatically collect and store location information from your Personal Device or vehicle you designate which is capable of producing location data (e.g., mobile device, GPS device, or vehicle). This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited. We also may aggregate this information, but this information will only be used for Alarm.com's internal purposes and to provide information requested by you. If you do not wish for us to collect and store this information, do not enable these features.
Video and Audio Data
When you (i) subscribe to Alarm.com's video monitoring or video monitoring add-on Services (such as the Visual Verification services), (ii) use a connected doorbell, camera, image sensor, or other connected device or wearable that is capable of recording video and/or audio recordings, or (iii) subscribe to two-way voice, you may enable us, certain of our third-party service providers, or your Central Station (as defined below), to record, store, view and process video and/or audio recordings from your monitoring equipment. This may include capturing and sending to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. We may process information from your monitoring equipment so that we can send you alerts. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings. As used herein, a "Central Station" is a third party selected by your Authorized Service Provider to receive alarm signals and coordinate emergency response.
Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of security cameras, connected doorbells and other devices with recording capabilities. You (not Alarm.com) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or business that they may be recorded using security cameras and other devices with recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with these laws.
Data We Collect Automatically
When you use the User Interfaces or access Alarm.com Services using your Personal Device, certain information may be collected by automated means, such as cookies. Information about Alarm.com’s use of cookies can be found in our
Cookie Policy
.
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have a legal basis. Legal bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for entering into or the performance of a contract with you), compliance with a legal obligation, and "legitimate interests."
Where we process personal data based on consent, we will ask for your unambiguous consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.
We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that such processing does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.  Where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.  Please keep in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to perform certain services for your benefit.  We process your personal data based on legitimate interests in order to:
Protect you, us, or others from security threats by enhancing the security of our network and information systems;
Identify and prevent fraud;
Comply with applicable laws and industry regulations;
Enable or administer our business, such as for invoicing Authorized Service Providers and maintenance of User Interfaces; and
Improve our User Interfaces and Services by enabling us to enhance, modify, or personalize them for your benefit.
Data Sharing
Alarm.com will not disclose your personal data to any other entity except:
as is necessary to provide the Alarm.com User Interfaces and Services to you;
to your Authorized Service Provider (also referred to as your Alarm.com Dealer), the company through which you subscribed to our Services;
to the Central Station selected by your Authorized Service Provider to receive alarm signals and coordinate emergency response;
when you have opted in to share the information;
to third party suppliers, subcontractors or business partners who work or perform services on our behalf and are only permitted to use the minimum amount of information necessary to assist in providing the Services;
as necessary in connection with other lawful business purposes; and
as otherwise necessary when required or permitted by law.
In addition, we may disclose your personal data when the personal data has been converted to a form that cannot be used to identify you. It may also be necessary for us to disclose your personal data in case of a merger or combination with, or acquisition of a portion of our business by, another company or entity, in which case personal data collected by Alarm.com would be expected to be one of the transferred business assets.
International Data Transfers
Our servers and offices are located in the United States, so your personal data will be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States.  We rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer personal data across borders, including the European Commission-approved "Standard Contractual Clauses" or "Model Clauses."
Exercising Your Rights
Right to Access, Correct, Update and Delete Personal Data
You may view, update, or delete certain personal data at any time by following the links at www.alarm.com to your profile and address book pages. These changes will be immediately made to our records. If you wish to stop Services notifications, you may do so through the User Interfaces.  For customers of Authorized Service Providers, changes you make to your user profile on the Alarm.com User Interfaces to your user profile may not automatically change the records of your Authorized Service Provider. You should contact your Authorized Service Provider directly to make changes to its records.
By contacting your Authorized Service Providers, you can also exercise the following rights:
Deletion.
You can ask to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).
Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data.
You can ask to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if there is no legal right to keep using it) or to limit use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
Take Your Data.
You can ask for a copy of your personal data provided in a machine readable form.
If we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
We do not make use of automated decision-making.  As defined under current data protection laws, automated decisions are defined as decisions about individuals that are based solely on the automated (i.e., no human involvement) processing of data and that produce legal effects or that significantly affect the individuals involved.
You have the right to register a complaint with a European data protection or supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority  (contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA are available at

; contact details for the data protection authority in the UK are available at

Alarm.com's Data Privacy Framework Notice
Alarm.com Incorporated (Alarm.com) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy  Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF)  as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Alarm.com has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and other processing of Personal Data (as defined below) received from the European Economic Area (EEA) in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Alarm.com has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Data Privacy Framework Notice (Notice) and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. To view our certification visit the DPF list at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search.
For more information about Alarm.com's privacy practices generally, please review Alarm.com's Privacy Policy.
Websites and mobile sites to which this Notice applies are United States-based websites, which are subject to United States law.
For purposes of this Notice, "Personal Data" means information that (i) is transferred from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland to the United States, (ii) is recorded in any form, (iii) is about, or relates to, an identified or identifiable consumer, customer, service provider or other individual, and (iv) can be linked to that consumer, customer, service provider or other individual. This Notice outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles for Personal Data.
Additionally, "consumer" as used in this Notice means any natural or legal person (to the extent a legal person is subject to a national data protection law in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland), but excludes any individual acting in his or her capacity as a former, current or prospective Alarm.com employee, agent, consultant or contractor.
Data Privacy Framework Principles
Alarm.com’s practices regarding the collection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of Personal Data comply with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, access, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, and recourse enforcement and liability.
Notice
We notify our customers and service providers located in the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland about the purposes for which we collect and use Personal Data, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information, the choices customers and service providers have for limiting the use and disclosure of their information, and how to contact us about our practices concerning Personal Data.
When we receive Personal Data from our affiliates and service providers in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such Personal Data relates.
Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Data
Alarm.com collects certain Personal Data such as:
names
addresses
phone numbers
email addresses
system data (e.g., alarm monitoring, thermostat, light and lock remote control).
We do not collect sensitive Personal Data of customers or service providers, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or other sensitive information as defined by the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF.
We use Personal Data of customers and service providers to:
provide you services and to respond to your requests
evaluate the quality of our products and services
communicate with you about our products, services and related issues
notify you of and administer offers and other promotions
for internal administrative and analytics purposes and to comply with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.
Choice
Alarm.com may share Personal Data with its service providers that deliver the Alarm.com services to you, business partners (like other technology providers with whom we integrate our services) among Alarm.com’s subsidiaries and affiliates. With respect to Personal Data we may share with other third parties, we provide customers and service providers located in the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please email us at support@alarm.com if you would like to opt-out. We do not use Personal Data for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which the information was originally collected without notifying the relevant consumers, customers, suppliers and others of such uses and offering an opportunity to opt-out. Should you opt-out as described above, Alarm.com may not be able to provide you with the services you have requested or access certain features of your system.
In addition, we may disclose Personal Data without offering individuals an opportunity to opt-out (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials based on an enforceable government request or as may be required under applicable law, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
Alarm.com also reserves the right to transfer Personal Data in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). Should such a sale or transfer occur, Alarm.com will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use Personal Data in a manner that is consistent with this Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, consumers may contact the entity to which Alarm.com transferred their Personal Data with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data
We may share Personal Data with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. We require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Data and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the data protection laws of Canada (i.e., the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and applicable provincial laws), as applicable, to either (i) subscribe to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles or (ii) contractually agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant DPF Principles. If the third party does not comply with its privacy obligations, Alarm.com will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data. If a third party service provider providing services on Alarm.com’s behalf processes Personal Data from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland in a manner inconsistent with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, Alarm.com will be liable unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damages.
Access to Personal Data
Alarm.com provides consumers, customers, suppliers and others with confirmation of whether or not Alarm.com is processing personal data relating to them and reasonable access to Personal Data maintained about them. We also provide a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate. We may limit or deny access to Personal Data where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. To obtain access to Personal Data, consumers, customers, suppliers and others may contact Alarm.com as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Notice.
Security
Alarm.com maintains reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Alarm.com takes reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data collected by Alarm.com is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used and that the information is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current. We depend on our consumers, customers, suppliers and others to update or correct their Personal Data whenever necessary.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Alarm.com has established procedures for periodically verifying implementation of and compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles. We conduct an annual self-assessment of our practices with respect to Personal Data to verify that representations we make about our Personal Data privacy practices are true and that related privacy policies have been implemented as represented.
Consumers, customers, suppliers and others residing in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland may file a complaint with our IT and Support Department in connection with Alarm.com’s processing of their Personal Data under the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF.. Alarm.com commits to refer unresolved privacy or data use complaints concerning our handling of Personal Data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, or Swiss-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of TRUSTe are provided at no cost to you.
If you have any complaints regarding Alarm.com’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, or Swiss-U.S. DPF, you should first contact us as provided above. A binding arbitration option will also be made available to individuals in accordance with the DPF Principles in order to address complaints not resolved by any other means. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Alarm.com’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF.
