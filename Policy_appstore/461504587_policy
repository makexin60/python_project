This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services, or otherwise interact with us (for example, by attending our premises or events or by communicating with us), unless a different policy is displayed. For information about how we process applicant and former employee data, please see the
Atlassian Careers Privacy Notice

including our cloud, server and data center products
.  We refer to all of these products, together with our other services and websites as "Services" in this policy.
This policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use information about you, which include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.
If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business
.
Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example, your employer), that organization controls the information processed by the Services. For more information, please see Notice to End Users below. This policy does not apply to the extent we process personal information in the role of a processor on behalf of such organizations.
What information we collect about you
We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.
Information you provide to us
We collect information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise provide it directly to us.
Account and Profile Information:
We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, you provide your contact information and, in some cases, billing information, when you register for the Services. You also have the option of adding a display name, profile photo, job title, and other details to your profile information to be displayed in our Services.  We keep track of your preferences when you select settings within the Services.
Content you provide through our products
: The Services include the Atlassian products you use, where we collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to include. Examples of content we collect and store include: the summary and description added to a Jira issue, the pages you create in Confluence, the name of a Trello board, your repositories and pull requests in Bitbucket, information regarding an incident in Statuspage or Opsgenie, any stories you name in Jira Align, any forms you create in Jira, and any feedback you provide to us. Content also includes the files and links you upload to the Services. If you use a server or data center version of the Services, we do not host, store, transmit, receive or collect information about you (including your content), except in limited cases, where permitted by your administrator: we collect feedback you provide directly to us through the product and; we collect content using analytics techniques that hash, filter or otherwise scrub the information to exclude information that might identify you or your organization; and we collect clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the Services. Server and data center administrators can disable our collection of this information from the Services via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Content you provide through our websites:
The Services also include our websites owned or operated by us. We collect other content that you submit to these websites, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities or events.
Information you provide through our support channels:
The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service.  Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.
Payment Information:
We collect payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services.  For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration.  You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.
Information we collect automatically when you use the Services
We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.
Your use of the Services
: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; search terms; your team’s Jira Align story progress; and how you interact with others on the Services.  We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you work with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most frequently.  If you use a server or data center version of the Services, the information we collect about your use of the Services is limited to clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the Services, in addition to content-related information described in "Content you provide through our products," above.  Server and data center administrators can disable our collection of this information from the Services via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Device and Connection Information
: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience.  How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.  Server and data center Service administrators can disable collection of this information via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being disclosed to us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
: Atlassian and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. For more information, please see our
Cookies and Tracking Notice
, which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies. Please refer to
Loom's Cookie Policy
for details on cookies and tracking technologies used within Loom products and websites.
Information we receive from other sources
We receive information about you from other Service users, from third-party services, from our related companies, social media platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above. This helps us to update and improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising and suggest services that may be of interest to you.
Other users of the Services
: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned in a Jira issue or paged via an Opsgenie incident opened by someone else, a team member may upload content about you to a Trello board, or your team’s story status may be discussed in Jira Align.  We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services.  Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing or technical contact on your company's account or when they designate you as an administrator.
Other services you link to your account
: We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate third-party apps, like Power-UPs, or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, disclose and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services.  For example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface. Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users. Your administrator may also authorize our Services to connect with a third party reporting service so your organization can review how the Services are being used. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
Atlassian Companies
:  We receive information about you from other Atlassian corporate affiliates, in accordance with their terms and policies.
Atlassian Partners
:  We work with a
global network of partners
who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.  Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our Services, generate leads for us, and resell our Services.  We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian Services you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.
Other Partners
: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.
Third Party Providers
: We may receive information about you from third party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles, for the purposes of targeted advertising of products that may interest you, delivering personalized communications, event promotion, and profiling.
How we use information we collect
How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.  Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.
To provide the Services and personalize your experience
: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate, maintain, and improve the Services.  For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.  For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.  We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites. Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you. To opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com.
For research and development
:  We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.  We use information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users. We automatically analyze and aggregate search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.
To communicate with you about the Services
: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.  We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a page or ticket, when a task is assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board. Depending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.
We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.  For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.  We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.  If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.
To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:
We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.  These communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.  We also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.  You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."
Customer support
: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services. Where you give us express permission to do so, we disclose information to a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.
For safety and security
: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations of Service policies.
To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights
:
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
With your consent
: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.  For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.
Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)
:
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:
We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.
How we disclose information we collect
We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.  This means disclosing information through the Services and to certain third parties.  We disclose information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers. Please note that information about you, your devices, and your behavior collected through third-party cookies, pixels, tags, or other tracking technologies for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising may be considered a “sale” or “share” under certain US state laws. However, Atlassian is not a data broker, and we do not sell personal information for monetary consideration.
Disclosing to other Service users
When you use the Services, we disclose certain information about you to other Service users.
For collaboration
: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, disclose, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select.  Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you disclose or interact with specific content.  For example, when you comment on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment. Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.  Your team’s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments. Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages, Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space, including information about you, can be publicly viewed, indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.  You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.
Managed accounts and administrators
: If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.  If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may disclose your contact information to current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.
Community Forums
:  Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g.,
Atlassian Community
,
Atlassian Developer Community
,
Trello Community
, and
Trello Inspiration
). You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.
Disclosing to third parties
We disclose information to third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties, excluding aggregators and providers of the text messaging services.
Service Providers
: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, marketing, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.
Atlassian Partners
: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may disclose your information to these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.  We may also disclose information to these third parties where you have agreed to that disclosure.
Third Party Apps
: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.  Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.  If you are an administrator, or a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we disclose your details to the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being disclosed to these third parties, please uninstall the app.
Links to Third Party Sites
: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Third Party Services:
We may offer you the ability to interact with or disclose information to third parties through the Services. For example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services. When you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may disclose certain information to those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service. Such information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.
Third Party Widgets
: Some of our services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button or Facebook "like" button. These widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.
With your consent
: We disclose information about you to third parties when you give us consent to do so.  For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.
Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights
: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our
Guidelines for Law Enforcement
and our
Transparency Report
.
Disclosing to affiliated companies
We disclose information we collect to affiliated companies and, in some cases, to prospective affiliates.  Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.  The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we disclose in these circumstances.
Atlassian companies
: We disclose information we have about you to other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you. This includes companies that own or operate the Services.
Business Transfers
: We may disclose or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
How we store and secure information we collect
Information storage and security
We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the
Atlassian Trust
,
Trello Trust
, and
Jira Align Trust
pages.
While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian. We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.
How long we keep information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
Account information
: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
Information you share on the Services
: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.  For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.
Managed accounts
: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.  For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.
Marketing information
: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.
How to access and control your information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
Your Choices
:
Where applicable under local law, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information.
Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have the right to request information about our processing of your information, to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, to request your information in a structured, electronic format, to request to correct or update your information, to request to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” of personal information and targeted advertising (as these terms are defined under applicable law), and to request to opt out of certain profiling activities.  Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.  You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.  For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.  Where you have asked us to disclose data to third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.  If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed. Where applicable under local law, you may also contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below to appeal any decision we make relating to your request to exercise your rights.
Access and update your information
: Our Services and related documentation (see
Atlassian Documentation
,
Trello Help
, and
Loom Documentation
) give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.  You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.
Deactivate your account
:   If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team through
Atlassian
’s support pages.  Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.  For more information on how to delete your information, see below.
Delete your information
: Our Services and related documentation (see
Atlassian Documentation
, and
Loom Documentation
) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
Request that we stop using your information
:  In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.  For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.  Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for certain marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.  When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.  If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).  If you object to information about you being disclosed to a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.
Opt out of communications
: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.  Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.
Opt out of targeted advertising
: Where applicable under local law, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising by
clicking here
and following the instructions.
You may also be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

for details on cookies and tracking technologies used within Loom products and websites.
Send "Do Not Track" Signals
: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Our websites may not respond to all browser-based DNT signals; however, our websites do respond to the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to opt-out of “sales” of personal information and targeted advertising in certain locales. For more information on the GPC and how to use a browser or browser extension incorporating the GPC signal, see
https://globalprivacycontrol.org/
. You can also use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.
Data portability
: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).  Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.  Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.
How we transfer information we collect internationally
International transfers of information we collect
We collect information globally and may transfer, process, and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services.  Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.
International transfers within the Atlassian Companies
: To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which the Atlassian owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we disclose information about you within and among Atlassian corporate affiliates, we make use of the Data Privacy Framework to receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European Economic Area to the U.S. (see “Data Privacy Framework Notice” section below), and the standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission, to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland. Refer to
this page
for a list of countries to which we regularly transfer personal data.
International transfers to third parties
: Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we disclose information of customers in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.
Data Privacy Framework Notice
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.
Atlassian, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiaries (Atlassian Network Service, Inc., Dogwood Labs, Inc., AgileCraft LLC, Halp, Inc., Loom, Inc., Opsgenie, Inc., and Trello, Inc.) adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data that is transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S.
Atlassian complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Atlassian has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework Program, please visit the Data Privacy Framework Program website
here
. To view Atlassian’s certifications, search for “Atlassian” in the Data Privacy Framework List.
As required under the principles, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework related (or general privacy-related) complaint.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our
U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider
(free of charge).  Through this third-party dispute resolution provider, we have also committed to cooperating and complying with the information and advice provided by an informal panel of data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (as applicable) in relation to unresolved complaints (as further described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles). You may also contact your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area or Switzerland (as applicable) for unresolved complaints.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the
Data Privacy Framework website
, including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.
Atlassian, Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Other important privacy information
Notice to End Users
Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.
Administrators are able to:
require you to reset your account password;
restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
access information in and about your account;
access or retain information stored as part of your account;
install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations
In some cases, administrators can also:
restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
change the email address associated with your account;
change your information, including profile information;
restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information
Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you are a member of a Trello team administered by an organization, or if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date.  You will be notified if this happens.
If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with the relevant Trello board, team or enterprise, or use your personal email address to register for or access the Services.  If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile.  Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.

Atlassian Careers Privacy Notice
Effective starting: September 18, 2023
1. What this notice covers
Thank you for your interest in joining our Team! As your privacy is important to us, we strive to be transparent about what Atlassian will, or will not, do with Talent Data (as defined below) and explain the purposes for processing it. This Careers Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is intended to provide you with information on how we collect, manage, use, process, and share information collected from you when considering you for career opportunities with Atlassian (including its
corporate affiliates
), such as when you apply for a position with us or when you express interest in future Atlassian opportunities by joining our
Talent Community
. We collect and process this data, which can include Personal Data (i.e. information relating to you), in compliance with applicable law. For simplicity, we’ll refer to this data as “Talent Data.”
For individuals who are not being considered for roles as Atlassian employees (e.g., certain contingent workers), Atlassian limits processing of Talent Data as we primarily work with the third party through which you are engaged.
This Notice does not cover your use of our products or services. To learn more about Atlassian’s privacy practices regarding your use of Atlassian products and services, please see our
Atlassian Privacy Policy
.
If you visit us onsite, a separate Visitors and Office Re-entry Privacy Notice will be surfaced to you.
2. Information We Collect
We collect Talent Data about you in connection to career opportunities with us.
Categories of Talent Data we may collect about you include, but are not limited, to:
Contact Information.
We may collect your contact information, such as full name, pronouns, home address, telephone or mobile number, email address or online identifier, job site information (e.g., LinkedIn profile) and onsite badge information (if you visit us onsite).
Government issued ID number or similar identifier.
We may collect your identification details, such as citizenship status, residency and work permit status.
Employment and Education.
We may collect information relating to your employment and education, including your cover letter, resume/CV, work experience or other relevant experience, educational background, and achievements. Where relevant for the position, we may receive information from professional licensing and certification bodies, employment research firms, identity verification services, and educational and training institutions.
Job Preferences.
We may collect information related to your job preferences, including career trajectory and interests, and willingness to relocate.
References
. We may ask for references from your previous employers or academic supervisors.
Background Checks.
Where permitted or required by law, we may conduct background checks once you have accepted a conditional offer from us.
Mandatory assessments.
We may collect information related to any assessment that is mandatory to assess your suitability for the role, such as phone screens, interviews and skills assessments (e.g., coding assessment for a software engineering role).
Publicly Available Information.
We may collect information you’ve made public, such as your public profile on career networking sites (e.g., information on your public LinkedIn profile) and your public portfolio website or code repository side (e.g., on Github).
Monitoring of Atlassian Networks and Resources.
If you visit us onsite, we may collect information relating to on-premise monitoring for security purposes (e.g., video surveillance). If you access and use Atlassian devices, networks (e.g., corporate wifi), or other resources, we may collect information related to your access and use, such as domain names and IP addresses.
Online usage information.
We may collect your online usage information when you browse our websites (e.g., our
Careers Page
) or use our Talent Community platform, including cookie information, traffic data or profiles, which may be combined with any of the foregoing categories of Talent Data.
Sensitive Talent Data
. While we treat all Talent Data with care, some Talent Data is more sensitive in nature so we refer to that as “Sensitive Talent Data.” Sensitive Talent Data may include demographic information such as your racial or ethnic origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, and veteran status, as well as your background check results, and health data (e.g., disability status). Atlassian generally collects Sensitive Talent Data directly from you. However, we may also collect Sensitive Talent Data from other sources. We may collect background check results through background check providers (if legally required or permitted). We may also collect certain Sensitive Talent Data, such as your race, ethnicity, and gender, from third party vendors or public sources (e.g., your LinkedIn profile) in order to help us with our
Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.
Voluntary Talent Data that you choose to provide us
. In connection to a career opportunity with Atlassian, you may choose to voluntarily provide us with certain Talent Data. For example, to participate in a voluntary opt-in survey (e.g., candidate experience feedback survey,
demographic survey
) or voluntary assessment (e.g., behavioral assessment). These programs are entirely optional and will be communicated as such. If you do choose to participate, we will collect certain information relating to your participation in the program. For example, if you participate in a demographic survey, we will collect information about how you identify as an individual. The types of information we collect and how we will use and share your information will be made clear to you before you decide whether you want to participate in the program.
Voluntary Talent Data will be collected directly from you on a voluntary opt-in basis. Voluntary opt-in basis means:
It will only be collected if you choose to provide opt-in consent (a separate and specific consent notice will be surfaced to you);
You can withdraw your consent at any time (this may not affect processing that has already occurred or Talent Data that has been de-identified so that we can no longer identify you); and
There will be no adverse consequences on your application for not providing Talent Data or for withdrawing your consent.
For Talent Data (including Sensitive Talent Data) that is required to assess your suitability for a career opportunity, please see Section 9 on how you can withdraw your application or request deletion.

Where we have identified you as a potential candidate from information we've collected from public sources or third parties, we may use Talent Data to suggest opportunities for you (e.g., reaching out to you for a specific opportunity, inviting you to join our Talent Community).

We may use Talent Data to evaluate our recruitment processes and activities, including assessing interview scheduling times and time to hire.
For reporting.
We may use Talent Data to analyze recruiting metrics for aggregated reporting (e.g., assessing the efficiency of our recruiting processes).
To build a more diverse Atlassian.
We may use Talent Data to help with the goals we have set in our
Sustainability Report
, because we know that in doing so we can unleash the potential of our teams. We may also use Talent Data to calibrate our actions and ensure our hiring process is as equitable as possible.
For our Talent Community.
If you join our Talent Community, we may use Talent Data to share content relevant to your career interests, to invite you to events that are relevant to your career interests, and to share career opportunities.
To protect Atlassian’s interests.
We may use Talent Data to protect our interests, which may include protecting our legal rights and maintaining the security and integrity of our facilities, equipment and electronic platforms.
As legally required.
We may use Talent Data as legally required, such as confirming your eligibility to work in the country in which you applied for a job, using your government ID for immigration processing purposes, conducting background checks, or submitting reports required by local law (e.g., EEOC reporting).
For other purposes with your consent
. If you voluntarily choose to participate in an optional program, we may use Voluntary Talent Data according to any purposes provided to you during the opt-in process.
Atlassian may leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically process Talent Data for these purposes. However, Atlassian does not use these technologies to make any automated decisions about you. By automated decisions, we mean decisions with little or no human involvement that have a legal or significant effect on you (e.g., to get hired).

Legal Bases for Individuals Located in the EEA, UK, or Brazil:
If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or Brazil, we collect and process Talent Data only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable laws. The legal bases depend on the type of Talent Data and the purpose we process it. This means we collect and process Talent Data only where:
We need it to administer a contract with you;
It satisfies a legitimate interest which is not overridden by your privacy rights (e.g., assessing your suitability, evaluating our recruiting processes, protecting our legal rights and interests);
You provide us consent for a specific purpose (e.g., demographic survey); or
We need to comply with a legal obligation (e.g., conducting legally required background checks).
If you have consented to our use of Talent Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent, but this may not affect any processing that has already taken place or Talent Data that has been de-identified so that we can no longer identify you. Where we are using Talent Data because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use.
Atlassian also shares Talent Data within the Atlassian
group of companies
for the purposes described in this section.
5. How and Why We Disclose Information Outside of Atlassian
Atlassian will disclose your Talent Data outside of Atlassian and its
group of companies
for the purposes defined above, including:
To facilitate the recruitment process.
We may disclose Talent Data to facilitate the recruitment process, such as with service providers (e.g., applicant tracking system provider, background check providers) and with third parties with your consent (e.g., references you provide us).
Service providers on our behalf.
We may disclose Talent Data with service providers who perform necessary duties and functions on our behalf (e.g., our applicant tracking system), which means they typically can only use your Talent Data to provide services to Atlassian and cannot use any identifying information for their own independent purposes.
External reports.
We may disclose anonymized, or aggregated and de-identified Talent Data in our external (i.e. public) reports, such as our
annual Sustainability report.
This means that you cannot be identified in the external report.
As legally required.
We may disclose Talent Data to a third party (e.g., courts, law enforcement agencies, government agencies) if we have a good faith belief that it is required or permitted under applicable law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect Atlassian or its affiliates, or to respond to a valid court order, subpoena, discovery request, search warrant, or other law enforcement request.
6. How We Transfer Information We Collect Internationally
In order to operate as a global company, Atlassian transfers and processes Talent Data outside your country of residence to other countries where Atlassian, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its 3rd party vendors operate. For example, our Talent Acquisition team is distributed throughout the globe and as a result, we may need to transfer your Talent Data to where the relevant Talent Acquisition team is located in order to manage your recruitment process. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. When Atlassian transfers your Talent Data to another country, it will ensure that the transfer complies with applicable law.
Atlassian has entered into agreements ensuring appropriate and suitable safeguards with its entities and service providers, including entering into the
European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses
where appropriate.
7. Data Privacy Framework Notice
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.
Atlassian, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiaries (Atlassian Network Service, Inc., Dogwood Labs, Inc., AgileCraft LLC, Opsgenie, Inc., and Trello, Inc.) adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data that is transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S.

As required under the principles, when we receive information under the Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data Privacy Framework related (or general privacy-related) complaint.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our

Data Privacy Framework website
, including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.

Former Workforce Privacy Notice
Effective starting: June 30, 2023
1. What this notice covers
This Former Workforce Privacy Notice (“Notice”) applies to the handling of your data (defined below) as a former employee or contingent worker (e.g., consultant, contractors) of Atlassian (collectively, "Atlassian Workers").
Your privacy is important to us, and we strive to provide clear and easy-to-understand information about how Atlassian collects, manages, uses, processes, and discloses Workforce Data. We collect and process this data, which can include Personal Data (i.e. information relating to you), in compliance with applicable law. For simplicity, we’ll refer to this data as “Workforce Data.”
For former contingent workers, Atlassian limits processing of Workforce Data to what is required to manage your assignment with us.
This Notice doesn’t cover personal use of Atlassian products (i.e. outside of your former employment or engagement with Atlassian, such as a personal Trello account). Learn more about Atlassian’s privacy practices for personal use of Atlassian products in our
Atlassian Privacy Policy
.
2. Information We Collect
We collect Workforce Data about you (and individuals associated with your relationship with Atlassian, such as dependents) in connection to your employment or engagement with us.
Categories of Workforce Data we may collect about you include, but are not limited, to:
Contact Details
. Your contact details may include your full name, home address, telephone or mobile number, email address or online identifier, and profile and avatar information.
Government issued ID number or similar identifier
: Your identification details may include your social security number, passport number, driver’s license number, citizenship status, residency, and work authorization (visa or permit) status.
Financial account information
. Your financial account information may include your bank account and portion of your credit or debit card number.
Images, voice, or videos
. Your likeness may include a headshot that you upload to our Human Resource Information System, a photo taken of you for promotional materials, or a video of you in a recorded meeting.
Recruitment related information
. Recruitment related information may be retained from your recruitment process, such as your skills assessments, employment information, and educational information. To learn more, please refer to our
Careers Privacy Notice
.
Employment related information
. Employment related information may include information related to your employment or assignment with Atlassian, such as your employment contract, offer letter, work location, hire date, termination date, craft expertise, skills, feedback, mandatory performance reviews and disciplinary records, compensation and allowance details, leave of absence, sick time, and vacation/holiday records.
Compensation and Benefits (including health) information
. Your compensation and benefits information may include information about you, your family members, your household, and other dependents to establish and administer benefits offered by Atlassian, such as health and wellness benefits, financial benefits, equity administration, and other related perks.
Life Events and Time Away
. We may collect information in the event of certain life and work events that may impact your relationship with Atlassian. If you take a leave of absence, we may collect the type of leave you are requesting, reason for leave (e.g., birth events, medical condition), dates of leave, and other details you may provide related to the life event.  Depending on the event, some of the information collected may include health information.
Work Content You Generate
. You may create work content in Hello (e.g., Confluence, JIRA), and other electronic resources we provide to you. Per your employment or engagement related agreement (e.g., Atlassian Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement), content you create in the performance of your duties and services, is owned by Atlassian.
Information we collect automatically
: We may automatically collect information about you when you use Hello or other electronic resources we provide to you. For example, we may collect logs and usage data within Hello, third party tools, or websites. We may also collect information relating to cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., device identifiers, pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across Hello instances and devices. For more information, please see our
Cookies and Tracking Notice
, which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.
Monitoring of Atlassian Networks and Resources
. We may collect information related to your access and use of Atlassian devices, tools, systems, networks, and other resources per our internal policies. While we make efforts to limit collection of information related to your personal life, we may collect this information if you use an Atlassian-issued device (e.g., Atlassian MacBook) or a personal device connected to the Atlassian Network (e.g., the corporate wifi, Atlassian VPN client). For information about this may be used in investigations, please see Section 5 below.
Voluntary Workforce Data that you choose to provide us
. During your time at Atlassian, you may choose to participate in voluntary opt-in programs, such as survey-based research, video-based research, and workplace-related assessments (e.g., behavioral assessments, productivity assessments). Unlike mandatory programs, such as performance reviews, these programs are entirely optional and will be communicated as such. There will be no adverse consequences if you choose not to participate. If you do choose to participate, we will collect certain information relating to your participation in the program. The types of information we collect and how we will use and share your information will be made clear to you before you decide whether you want to participate in the program. You will also be able to withdraw your consent. For example, you will be able to stop participating in the program and request deletion of certain information you provided during the program.
While we treat all Workforce Data with care, some Workforce Data is more sensitive in nature so we refer to that as “
Sensitive Workforce Data
.” Sensitive Workforce Data may include information revealing racial or ethnic origin, demographics (e.g., date of birth, gender), sexual orientation, health data (e.g., reason for sick leave, special needs for reasonable accommodation, inferring someone’s mental health), veteran status, and background check results (e.g., criminal record data).
Atlassian limits collection of Sensitive Workforce Data. Except as noted below, where we do collect any it will be collected directly from you on a voluntary opt-in basis. Voluntary opt-in basis means:
It will only be collected if you choose to provide opt-in consent;
You can withdraw your consent at any time. For example, if you voluntarily choose to provide certain Sensitive Personal Data in our Human Resource Information System (e.g., sexual orientation) for purposes of our DEI program, you will be able to withdraw your consent and delete the Sensitive Workforce Data you have provided; and
There will be no adverse consequences on your employment or engagement for not providing Sensitive Workforce Data or for withdrawing your consent.
Atlassian may collect and process Sensitive Workforce Data in the following ways that will not be based on voluntary opt-in consent:
To comply with legal or contractual obligations (e.g., demonstrating compliance with anti-discrimination laws, conducting legally required background checks, conducting contractually required background checks)
To verify the information you provided during
the recruitment process
(e.g., background check)
For monitoring purposes set out in our internal policies
To manage our employment or engagement with you (e.g., your date of birth may be required to process payments owed to you, health data in order to take long term sick leave).
3. Where We Collect Workforce Data From
In relation to your employment or engagement with Atlassian and in compliance with applicable law and internal policy, we may collect Workforce Data about you from the following sources:
Directly from you
. We collect Workforce Data directly from you, for example when you provide contact details for your Atlassian Account and when you provide financial account information so we can process payments owed to you.
From other Atlassian Workers
. We collect Workforce Data from other Atlassian Workers, for example when your colleagues provide feedback about you and when they reference you in work content (e.g., Jira issue).
From third parties
. We collect Workforce Data from third parties, for example we may receive Workforce Data from a benefits vendor to process benefits reimbursements. Depending on your role, we may also collect your Workforce Data from customers and partners.
Automatically
. When you access and use Atlassian devices, tools, systems, networks, and other resources, we automatically collect certain Workforce Data such as information relating to your online usage and device information (e.g., network monitoring).
4. How We Use Workforce Related Information
Atlassian strives to be transparent about how Workforce Data will be used. Atlassian uses Workforce Data for the following purposes:
To administer and manage the Atlassian Workforce
. We use Workforce Data to fulfill and manage our employment or engagement contracts with Atlassian Workers. For example, your financial account information to process payments and reimbursements, your home location for tax reporting, your financial account information to reimburse expenses, your work email to provision benefits, and your work content for performance reviews and career development.
To support Atlassian’s business operations
. We use Workforce Data to operate our business. For example, we may use your contact details to maintain our internal directory and manage business records related to your employment or engagement, your network monitoring information for purposes outlined in our internal policies, your work content to assess performance and capacity (e.g., cycle times, sales targets), and your tool and product usage data to gather various insights around ways of working (these insights are typically aggregated).
To improve Atlassian products and services
. We may use Workforce Data for research and development. For example, we may use your work content and Hello usage data to measure and improve our products or create new features and services.
To offer products and services
. We may use Workforce Data to offer products and services that may be of interest to employees. For example, using your work contact details and home location to offer health, wellness, and financial benefits.
To market and advertise
. We may use your likeness to market and advertise our products and services to customers and prospects (if we do so, we will inform you). For example, we may use your image in a marketing campaign.
To mitigate risk
. We may use Workforce Data to mitigate or respond to risk to Atlassian, Atlassian Workers, customers, and the general public, including for network monitoring, safety and building management, business continuity, physical security, health and safety, emergency notifications, and HR-related investigations regarding alleged misconduct (see Section 5). For example, we may use your contact details to contact you in an emergency.
To protect Atlassian’s interests
. We may use Workforce Data to protect our interests, including to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential company secrets, and in disputes or legal proceedings.
To comply with legal requirements
. We may use Workforce Data to comply with the law. For example, using your race/ethnicity (if provided) to comply with anti-discrimination laws (e.g., EEOC reporting), your government ID for immigration processing purposes, and providing certain employment related information to respond to subpoenas and other legal or governmental requests.
For other purposes with your consent
. If you voluntarily choose to participate in an optional program, we will use related Workforce Data with your consent and according to any purposes provided to you during the opt-in process. For example, if you choose to participate in an internal survey, we will use your survey responses according to the specific purposes provided to you (e.g., to help build better teams). If you choose to provide Sensitive Workforce Data in our Human Resource Information System for our DEI program, we will use it only for those purposes.
Atlassian may leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence to automatically process Workforce Data for these purposes. However, Atlassian does not make any automated decisions about you. Automated decisions means decisions without any human involvement that have a legal or significant affect (e.g., an effect on your employment or engagement).
Atlassian also shares Workforce Data within the Atlassian
group of companies
for the purposes described in this section.
4.1. Legal Bases for Atlassian Workers Based in the EEA, UK, or Brazil
If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or Brazil, we collect and process Workforce Data only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable laws. The legal bases depend on the type of Workforce Data and the purpose we process it. This means we collect and process Workforce Data only where:
We need it to administer our employment or engagement contract with you (e.g., to process payments owed to you);
It satisfies a legitimate interest which is not overridden by your privacy rights (e.g., operating our business, improving our products, protecting our legal rights and interests);
You provide us consent for a specific purpose; or
We need to comply with a legal obligation (e.g., complying with anti-discrimination laws).
If you have consented to our use of Workforce Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using Workforce Data because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use.
5. How We Use Information We Collect for Investigations
Atlassian may collect and use Workforce Data to investigate alleged misconduct, such as breaches of law or violations of the Atlassian Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or other policies. Workforce Data used for investigative purposes can include your access and use of Atlassian electronic resources, including information technology systems (such as email, chat, phone, and internet) and networks, and your access and retrieval of proprietary Atlassian systems, documents, and records. We may also use images from security cameras and other optical surveillance technologies. To the extent data collected will be accessed and used for investigation of misconduct, Atlassian is committed to maintaining the privacy of Atlassian Workers during investigations and will consult with appropriate personnel (e.g., Legal, Employee Relations) to ensure that access will be limited only to relevant information that supports a bona fide investigation. Atlassian will work to restrict the number of individuals with access to Workforce Data for investigative purposes to the smallest possible number of individuals who need access to data to conduct or fulfill a specific action.
6. How and Why We Disclose Information We Collect Outside of Atlassian
Atlassian will disclose your Workforce Data outside of Atlassian and its
group of companies
for the purposes defined in Section 4, including:
To administer and manage our relationship with you
. We may disclose Workforce Data in order to manage our employment or engagement contract with you, such as sharing with a necessary vendor (as defined below) to process payments owed to you.
Necessary vendors on our behalf
. We will disclose your Workforce Data with third party vendors, such as our payroll provider, Human Resource Information System provider, equity provider, fitness and wellness benefits provider, and health insurance providers. These third party vendors perform necessary duties and functions on our behalf (i.e. enable us to provide and administer our human resources and business functions). These third party vendors are typically only allowed to use your Workforce Data to provide services to Atlassian and cannot use any identifying information for their own independent purposes.
As required by your role with Atlassian
. Atlassian Workers may need to disclose Workforce Data externally for Atlassian’s business operations based on the nature of their role. We will take steps to protect your privacy. For example, if you are in a Customer Support role, only your public name will be used in our
Support Help Desk
.
For marketing and advertising
. We may disclose your Workforce Data for marketing and advertising our products and services (if we do so, we will inform you). For example, we may use your likeness in our external-facing marketing materials on our websites or social media posts.
In a sale, merger or transfer
. We may disclose your Workforce Data as part of a sale, merger, or transfer of any part of our business. In compliance with applicable law, we will notify you of such transfer of your Workforce Data.
To mitigate risk
. We may disclose your Workforce Data when we believe it is appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Atlassian, our product or services, Atlassian customers or end users, our workforce or the public at large.
Optional benefits vendors
. We may disclose your Workforce Data with third party vendors (e.g., discount portal vendors) who provide optional benefits. The information we share is typically limited to what is required for verification and reporting. Since your participation with these benefits vendors is optional, you will be establishing an independent relationship with them. Use and sharing of Workforce Data in this context is covered by the optional benefit vendor’s contracts, policies, and privacy notices. Be sure to review the privacy notice or policy of any optional benefits vendor when you decide to establish a relationship with them.
As legally required
. We and our
group of companies
may disclose your Workforce Data with courts, law enforcement agencies, or other government bodies when Atlassian has a good faith belief it is required or permitted to do so under applicable law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect Atlassian or its affiliates, or to respond to a valid court order, subpoena, discovery request, search warrant, or other law enforcement request.
7. How to Exercise Your Rights
If you are a contingent worker, please contact the third party you are working through (e.g., staffing agency, independent company or consulting firm).
Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have certain rights with respect to your Workforce Data. For example, you may have the right to request information about Atlassian's processing of your personal data, to request a copy of your personal data, to object to our use of your personal data, to request the deletion or restriction of your personal data, or to request the correction or update of your personal data. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.
7.1. Self-service controls
We respect and value your privacy, and strive to surface choice and controls wherever possible. You retain access to certain Necessary Vendors after your employment or engagement ends, and can access, update and delete certain Workforce Data through their self-serve features.
7.2. Limitations
Atlassian processes Workforce Data primarily to operate its business and manage relationships with Atlassian Workers. Therefore, your requests and choices may be limited in certain cases. For example:
You may have limited control over how we use and disclose your personal data in order to process payments to you
You won’t be able to delete personal data that is required to manage Atlassian’s relationship with you, that Atlassian is required to retain by applicable law, or that Atlassian has compelling legitimate interests to keep
We may not be able to fulfill your request if it would reveal personal data about another individual (to protect their privacy)
Where you have asked us to share data with an optional benefits vendor, you will need to contact that vendor directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted
To the extent we use Workforce Data for a purpose not disclosed in this Notice or other relevant internal policy or notice, we will inform you and offer an opportunity for you to withdraw your consent or object to such use.
7.3. Voluntary programs
If you’ve provided Atlassian voluntary consent to participate in an optional program, your Workforce Data will only be used according to the purposes provided in this Notice or the other policy or notice that was surfaced to you when you participated in the optional program. You may withdraw your consent at a later time, although that may not affect any processing that has already taken place.
7.4. Questions
Please email
employeeprivacy@atlassian.com
if you have any questions or would like to submit a request to access, correct, delete, or restrict your Workforce Data. You may also have your authorized agent make a request on your behalf. Depending on your request, you may be required to provide certain verification, such as confirming you have access to the email we have on file.
If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.
8. How Long We Keep Information We Collect
Atlassian will collect, use, process, and retain Workforce Data in accordance with its internal policies and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Atlassian will retain your Workforce Data no longer than necessary to carry out the purposes provided in this Notice (or any other applicable notice), and as required or permitted under applicable law.
9. How We Store and Secure Information We Collect
Atlassian is committed to safeguarding your Workforce Data and requires any personnel accessing or using Workforce Data of the Atlassian Workforce to be held accountable and comply with Atlassian’s privacy and security policies and procedures and the Atlassian Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including specifically as it relates to the Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets. Read about
Atlassian’s information security program
.
While the broader Atlassian Workforce has access to certain Workforce Data as part of business operations (e.g., internal directory information, work content), access to other Workforce Data (e.g., Sensitive Workforce Data) is typically restricted to select personnel from certain departments who have a need to know. For example, select personnel from Finance may have access to your financial account information, select personnel from the People and IT teams may have access to Sensitive Workforce Data in our Human Resource Information System, and select personnel from IT, Security, and People may have access to your network logs.
Atlassian may notify you in the event of a security or privacy incident in accordance with its incident response procedures and applicable law.
9.1. Vendors
Before we share Workforce Data with necessary vendors, the vendor must be approved through our procurement process. This cross-functional review process requires the vendor’s internal controls and data flow to meet industry best-practices and requirements from various teams, including Security, Risk and Compliance and Privacy.
9.2. Privacy-enhancing measures
When possible and appropriate, Atlassian uses Workforce Data in an anonymized, aggregated and/or de-identified fashion so that an individual cannot be identified. For example, Sensitive Workforce Data will typically only be used at an aggregated and de-identified level. We may also share out anonymized metrics around certain Sensitive Workforce Data (e.g., race) in our
external facing Sustainability report
. If there is a need to use Workforce Data that identifies you, Atlassian will take measures to protect your privacy, such as establishing sufficient security controls and limiting access to those who have a valid business reason to access it.
10. How We Transfer Information We Collect Internationally
In order to operate as a global company, Atlassian transfers and processes Workforce Data outside your country of residence to other countries where Atlassian, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its third party vendors operate. For example, our People Operations team is distributed throughout the globe and as a result, we may need to transfer your Workforce Data to where the relevant People Operations team is located in order to manage our employment relationship with you. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. When Atlassian transfers your Workforce Data to another country, it will ensure that the transfer complies with applicable law.
Atlassian has entered into agreements ensuring appropriate and suitable safeguards with its entities and 3rd party vendors, including entering into the
European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses
where appropriate.
11. For EU and UK Based Atlassian Workers: EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Notice

The storage by Atlassian of Personal Data on servers and/or on software made available or hosted by third parties shall not be considered disclosures of Personal Data to a third party so long as the third party does not have direct access to the Personal Data stored or hosted. In all events, Atlassian shall ensure by contract that any such third party (a) is aware of the Principles or (b) is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles or (c) has contractual safeguards in place to protect the Personal Data.
Atlassian may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
11.3. Your Rights and Choices
Please refer to Section 7 for information how to access, correct, or delete your Personal Data. Please note that there may be limitations where (i) the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy (ii) requests are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or (iii) the rights of other persons would be violated.

Demographic Survey Privacy Notice
Effective starting: September 18, 2023
1. What this notice covers
At Atlassian, we believe in the power of diversity and are committed to a culture of inclusion. In our
Sustainability Report
we pledged to build a more diverse Atlassian, because we know that in doing so we can unleash the potential of our teams. To help us on this journey to where we want to be, we are asking for your help in completing a demographic survey. This survey is part of our diversity program focused on better understanding our candidate experiences and evolving our recruitment process to improve equitable outcomes. Your contribution would be greatly valued as it is a step in our Corporate Social Responsibility initiative towards helping build a more diverse Atlassian.
Your participation in this demographic survey is entirely voluntary and based on your opt-in consent. All questions within the survey are also entirely voluntary. If you decide to participate, we will only use the information as detailed in this Notice. If you choose not to participate, there will be no adverse impact on your application.
2. Information We Collect
The demographic survey will ask you for information regarding certain demographics, including your:
Age range
Gender identity
Sexual orientation
Race
Ethnicity
Disabilities
We will refer to this data as “Demographic Data.”
3. How We Use and Secure This Information
Demographic Data will be used for the following purposes:
For our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives
: As part of our diversity program, we will use Demographic Data to analyze representation of URGs in our talent pipeline and determine ways to increase diversity in our talent pool and improve our equitable outcomes.
As legally required
: We will use Demographic Data to fulfill our obligations under applicable laws, such as government diversity reporting.
Your Demographic Data will be stored in combination with other details about you, such as your name and country location. This information will be stored securely and subject to strict access controls. For example, only a small number of system admins and data engineers will have access to your identifiable demographic data for the purposes of system maintenance, de-identifying the data, and creating aggregated reporting to help achieve our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.
4. How and Why We Share Information Outside of Atlassian
Atlassian will disclose Demographic Data outside of Atlassian and its group of companies for the following purposes:
Service providers on our behalf

Corporate Social Responsibility report
.

Careers Privacy Notice
for more information on how we transfer information we collect internationally.

Exercise Your Rights
Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect

Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.

As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please

GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
