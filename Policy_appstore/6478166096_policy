Data Handling
Hidy VPN limits data processing strictly to what is essential for providing Hidy VPN services, handling payments, and managing the Hidy VPN website and mobile apps. Data is processed both automatically and manually by Hidy VPN, without involvement from any subsidiaries, unless stated otherwise. For payment processing, email services, marketing, and basic analytics of our website and app, Hidy VPN employs third-party processors. We adhere to a strict no-logs policy for Hidy VPN services, ensuring that user activities are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored, or shared with any third parties.
Data Collection
User registration is optional. If you decide to register, you must provide your email address, which enables us to communicate important service announcements, updates, or report issues. A valid email address is also necessary for password recovery and establishing a VPN connection. For payments, we process basic billing details through our payment partners. Users must ensure their payment information is accurate and up to date. Hidy VPN may also collect limited technical data for service improvement purposes. Without this data, we may not be able to fully provide our services. This includes server load information to recommend optimal servers to our customers.
Advertising and Data Sharing
We collaborate with third-party advertisers to collect data through cookies and pixel tags for targeted advertising based on user preferences. This data collection spans across devices and may include advertisements from companies unrelated to us. While we do not control third-party cookies, we recommend users exercise caution and review third-party privacy policies for information on their cookie usage. Our partnership for data exchange and usage insights is with Admob (Privacy Policy: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).
Underage Users
Individuals under 18 are prohibited from using Hidy VPN services without parental or guardian supervision. We presume all users and data providers to our services are at least 18 years old. If we become aware of any underage users or incorrect data, we reserve the right to terminate their access to Hidy VPN services immediately.
Data Processing Justification
We process personal data to deliver the best possible Hidy VPN service, based on the contractual agreement as outlined in our Terms of Service. Direct marketing efforts may utilize your email address with your consent or as allowed by law without separate consent.
Data Protection Rights
Users have the right to inquire about their personal data held by us, request corrections, object to certain data uses, and request data deletion. We comply with legal obligations to retain or share limited data when legally required, but we do not log browsing histories or IP addresses, making it difficult to link activities to individual users.
Opt-Out and Data Control
Users can opt out of communications and control cookie settings through their browser. If you disagree with how we process personal data, you have the option to discontinue using Hidy VPN services and request data processing cessation.
Term of Data Retention
Hidy VPN retains minimal personal data only for as long as necessary to provide our services, up to a maximum of 2 years post-last use. Users can request a detailed list of personal data collected by contacting dev@cassandera.com.

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. We encourage users to review it regularly. Changes take effect upon publication. Users cannot transfer their rights under this Privacy Policy to third parties. For any privacy-related questions or to exercise privacy rights, contact us at dev@cassandera.com.
