Using the App
Your location is set the first time you run the app. If it isn't set properly, you can set it via the options screen. You can enter your location manually (latitude and longitude) or look it up by zip code.
The main view lets you zoom and pan using gestures (drag and pinch).
Move back and forth between the satellite passes using the arrows. If you don't see any satellite passes displayed, go into the options screen and make sure 'view satellites' is turned on.
The options screen has several options which control how many satellite passes you are shown. These include the satellite selection (ALL or a specific satellite), how many days to scan, minimum magnitude and minimum elevation.
When it is time to go outside and view satellites, you can switch to 'Real Time' mode. This shows the satellites that are in the sky right now with the position of each along its path.
You can turn on constellations and star information from the options screen. Once you have done that, you can tap on a constellation's name to see its information, or tap on a red star to see its information.
Recording Your Sightings
The 'My Sightings' screen (via the options screen) shows you how many sightings and how many different satellites you've seen. Be sure to record your sightings each time you see a satellite by tapping the 'I See It' button which is located on the Satellite Info screen. You get into the satellite info screen by tapping on the satellite's name in the main view.
Successful Sighting
Persistence is the key to success when trying to spot satellites. Many factors influence whether a given satellite is visible at a given time.
It is essential to choose an evening with clear sky and no moon. It is also essential to get away from city lights. In the beginning, focus on spotting the brighter satellites that pass directly overhead (e.g., magnitude 4 or less). Over time, you will learn what works best for your specific location.
Satellite waching can be a lot of fun, and is a great family activity. There are many online resources. You can start with
