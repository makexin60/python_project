Clarity Privacy Policy
Effective date: April 8, 2023
Summary
No personally identifiable information is gathered from the application by default. There is no account creation requirement and by default your entries are stored only on your device.
There are three exceptions:
1. Opting in to Cloud Sync (off by default) links your entries to your Google or Apple account in an encrypted
Google Cloud Storage
bucket via Firebase. By default, your entries are stored only on your device to maintain your privacy.
2. Opting in to
"tracking"
(off by default) allows your phone identifier (IDFA) to be shared with advertising partners for attribution purposes.
3. Any AI features such as the AI Chatbot involves data being processed by third party vendors.
We also use Analytics services to collect anonymous aggregate data. These analytics gather information that can help us improve the app, such as amount of time spent on a page across all users, how often users return to the app in general, and which parts of the app are most viewed by all users.
We do NOT sell your personal data to anyone, including data brokers, insurance companies, and social media companies. We are not in the business of selling data-- we are in the business of improving mental health.
