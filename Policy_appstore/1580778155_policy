What We Do
At
Sussex Directories Inc,
(“Sussex,” “Psychology Today,” “we,” “us” or “our”) we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal data when you access or use websites, applications, and services that are owned and operated by us and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you, the users of our Services (“Users”, “you,” or “your”) understand how we treat your personal data.
By using or accessing our Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described here
. If you are using the services on behalf of another person (such as a minor), you confirm that you have the authority to accept this policy on their behalf. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services.
When We Ask For Your Explicit Consent
As part of our service, we may ask for your consent to agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our
Terms
. We need your explicit consent because, in order to provide the relevant tools, we may need to capture, store, and occasionally share private information about you. This allows us to deliver a secure, seamless, and personalized experience while adhering to legal requirements and best practices for data protection.
By giving your explicit consent, you are agreeing to how we handle your data, ensuring it is used only for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy—such as improving our services, maintaining security, and enabling the features you rely on. We never share your information without a valid reason or without taking steps to protect your privacy.
Your trust is vital to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your data with industry-standard security measures and strict privacy protocols. Below are the services that require your explicit consent before being used:
Emails to and from Professional Members (Message Center):
When you use a contact form to send an email to a Professional Member listed on the directory, your email is handled by a HIPAA compliant Service which keeps and stores your emails securely within a message center. Certified hosting services (such as Amazon Web Services) securely process and host the data. Only the intended recipient can access the email. This feature enables private, secure, compliant communication between Users and Professional Members through email, through our website and through our native mobile app for Professional Members. While emails are stored and handled securely within our Service,
email itself, especially in transit, is an insecure form of communication
. Avoid including sensitive information, such as medical or insurance details, that could be intercepted or misused. By consenting, you acknowledge that your emails, sent through the contact form on our Site and any further email communications may be processed within the message center to provide these functionalities, in compliance with privacy regulations.
Professional Members Login and PT Pro (Native App):
Professional Members must provide consent when first logging into their member area or using the PT Pro app. These tools allow Professional Members to efficiently manage their profiles, including editing details, reviewing profile statistics (e.g. views, contacts), and inviting and hosting online video sessions with clients. Professional Members can also access a history of client communications within the message center and the PT Pro app, where they can directly contact clients. All personal data and communication with clients is held securely within HIPAA compliant servers. Professional Members may sign a Business Associate Agreement, which is incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy. By providing consent, you authorize Sussex to process the necessary data to support these features while maintaining the highest standards of data protection.
Client Video (Video Conferencing Tool for Users):
The client  video conferencing tool, available to Users on the web and in an app (“Client Video”) provides a secure, and simple video conferencing tool for clients to meet Professional Members online for therapy sessions. Sussex Directories simply provides this tool as an effective means of communication, but does not offer any therapy or health services itself. The Client Video app is secure and does not capture, store or use any health information. By consenting, you agree to the use, processing and storage of necessary technical data to establish and maintain a secure video connection, ensuring your privacy and confidentiality.

6. Data Security
At
Sussex
, we are committed to safeguarding your personal data and take the security of your data seriously. We have implemented a variety of physical, technical, organizational, and administrative measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures are based on the type of personal data we collect and how we process that data. For example, we use
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology to encrypt personal data during transmission.
We store and process your information on servers located in the European Union and, where applicable, elsewhere, and we maintain industry-standard backup and archival systems.
The security of your data also depends on you. If you are a Professional Member using our Services, we encourage you to protect your account by choosing a strong password, keeping your login credentials confidential, and signing off after using our services. If you use a work or school email to communicate, please be aware that your employer or institution may have legal access to your communications. Additionally, be cautious when sharing information in public areas of the website, as any content posted publicly can be accessed by others.
While we strive to protect your data and provide a secure operating environment, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and you acknowledge that any transmission of personal data is done at your own risk. Except as required by law, we are not responsible for unauthorized access, loss, theft, or disclosure of your personal data. Please be mindful of these risks when sharing information on the internet.
Data Breach Notification
In the event of a data breach involving your personal data, we will take appropriate steps to notify you as required by applicable laws. This may include notifications via email or prominent notices on our website, depending on the nature of the breach and regulatory requirements. We are committed to prompt and transparent communication in these situations to ensure that you can take necessary precautions to protect your information.
7. Data Retention
We retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to provide our services and for the business purposes for which the data was collected. When determining the retention period for different types of data, we consider factors such as the source of the data, our need for it, the purpose for which it was collected, and its sensitivity. In some instances, we may retain personal data for extended periods if required to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, collect outstanding fees, continue providing our Services, or if otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, we may keep information in an anonymous or aggregated form that does not identify you personally.

We aim to handle all personal data responsibly and securely, with careful consideration of privacy and legal requirements.
8. HIPAA Compliance and PHI
Certain information that Sussex collects as part of providing its Services may qualify as Protected Health Information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Specifically, when (i) Sussex is providing administrative, operational, or other services to a healthcare professional who is a “Covered Entity” under HIPAA; and (ii) in order to provide those services, Sussex receives identifiable information about a user on behalf of the Covered Entity, thereby acting as a “Business Associate” under HIPAA; and (iii) that information includes sensitive health information about the user, then that information may qualify as PHI and will be handled in compliance with HIPAA regulations.
On the occasions that Sussex may store or handle PHI for Professional Members or entities that are Covered Entities, our compliance obligations are outlined in the
Business Associate Agreement,
which is incorporated by reference in this policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead governed by HIPAA.
HIPAA establishes specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and outlines how PHI can be used or disclosed. To learn more about how your PHI is handled, please refer to the
Notice of Privacy Practices
provided by your professional.
In instances where Sussex collects health-related data that does not fall under HIPAA protections, we handle such information in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including relevant state health privacy regulations such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA).This means we take steps to secure and limit access to health information and disclose it only as allowed by law.
Sussex does not market, sell or provide healthcare services whether digitally or otherwise and is not a Covered Entity under HIPAA. Sussex is not in the business of healthcare. Sussex is a publisher and a media company. Personal data collected when we are not acting as a Business Associate is not classified as PHI and is governed by this Privacy Policy.

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us with personal data, please contact us at
support@psychologytoday.com

What We Do
At
Sussex Directories Inc,
(“Sussex,” “Psychology Today,” “we,” “us” or “our”) we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal data when you access or use websites, applications, and services that are owned and operated by us and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you, the users of our Services (“Users”, “you,” or “your”) understand how we treat your personal data.
By using or accessing our Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described here
. If you are using the services on behalf of another person (such as a minor), you confirm that you have the authority to accept this policy on their behalf. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services.
When We Ask For Your Explicit Consent
As part of our service, we may ask for your consent to agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our
Terms
. We need your explicit consent because, in order to provide the relevant tools, we may need to capture, store, and occasionally share private information about you. This allows us to deliver a secure, seamless, and personalized experience while adhering to legal requirements and best practices for data protection.
By giving your explicit consent, you are agreeing to how we handle your data, ensuring it is used only for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy—such as improving our services, maintaining security, and enabling the features you rely on. We never share your information without a valid reason or without taking steps to protect your privacy.
Your trust is vital to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your data with industry-standard security measures and strict privacy protocols. Below are the services that require your explicit consent before being used:
Emails to and from Professional Members (Message Center):
When you use a contact form to send an email to a Professional Member listed on the directory, your email is handled by a HIPAA compliant Service which keeps and stores your emails securely within a message center. Certified hosting services (such as Amazon Web Services) securely process and host the data. Only the intended recipient can access the email. This feature enables private, secure, compliant communication between Users and Professional Members through email, through our website and through our native mobile app for Professional Members. While emails are stored and handled securely within our Service,
email itself, especially in transit, is an insecure form of communication
. Avoid including sensitive information, such as medical or insurance details, that could be intercepted or misused. By consenting, you acknowledge that your emails, sent through the contact form on our Site and any further email communications may be processed within the message center to provide these functionalities, in compliance with privacy regulations.
Professional Members Login and PT Pro (Native App):
Professional Members must provide consent when first logging into their member area or using the PT Pro app. These tools allow Professional Members to efficiently manage their profiles, including editing details, reviewing profile statistics (e.g. views, contacts), and inviting and hosting online video sessions with clients. Professional Members can also access a history of client communications within the message center and the PT Pro app, where they can directly contact clients. All personal data and communication with clients is held securely within HIPAA compliant servers. Professional Members may sign a Business Associate Agreement, which is incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy. By providing consent, you authorize Sussex to process the necessary data to support these features while maintaining the highest standards of data protection.
Client Video (Video Conferencing Tool for Users):
The client  video conferencing tool, available to Users on the web and in an app (“Client Video”) provides a secure, and simple video conferencing tool for clients to meet Professional Members online for therapy sessions. Sussex Directories simply provides this tool as an effective means of communication, but does not offer any therapy or health services itself. The Client Video app is secure and does not capture, store or use any health information. By consenting, you agree to the use, processing and storage of necessary technical data to establish and maintain a secure video connection, ensuring your privacy and confidentiality.

These measures are based on the type of personal data we collect and how we process that data. For example, we use
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology to encrypt personal data during transmission.
We store and process your information on servers located in the European Union and, where applicable, elsewhere, and we maintain industry-standard backup and archival systems.
The security of your data also depends on you. If you are a Professional Member using our Services, we encourage you to protect your account by choosing a strong password, keeping your login credentials confidential, and signing off after using our services.

On the occasions that Sussex may store or handle PHI for Professional Members or entities that are Covered Entities, our compliance obligations are outlined in the
Business Associate Agreement,
which is incorporated by reference in this policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead governed by HIPAA.
HIPAA establishes specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and outlines how PHI can be used or disclosed. To learn more about how your PHI is handled, please refer to the
Notice of Privacy Practices
provided by your professional.
In instances where Sussex collects health-related data that does not fall under HIPAA protections, we handle such information in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including relevant state health privacy regulations such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA).This means we take steps to secure and limit access to health information and disclose it only as allowed by law.
Sussex does not market, sell or provide healthcare services whether digitally or otherwise and is not a Covered Entity under HIPAA. Sussex is not in the business of healthcare. Sussex is a publisher and a media company. Personal data collected when we are not acting as a Business Associate is not classified as PHI and is governed by this Privacy Policy.
9. Children’s Privacy
The Services provided by
Sussex
are not intended for or directed to children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the Services, or submit any personal data. By accessing, using, or submitting information to or through the Services, you confirm that you are over the age of 13. In accordance with our
Terms of Use

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received such information without verified parental consent, we will use that information only to notify the child (or their parent or legal guardian) that they are not permitted to use the Services and promptly delete the information. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us with personal data, please contact us at
support@psychologytoday.com
.
Users between 13 years of age and the age of legal majority in their jurisdiction may only use the Services with parental or guardian consent or supervision. If you are a parent or legal guardian and are using the Services on behalf of your minor child, any information you provide will be treated as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Deletion of Data
You also have the right to request that we delete the personal data we have collected from you. The CCPA includes certain exceptions to this right, such as when we need to retain your personal data to provide our services or to complete a transaction you have requested. If your deletion request falls under an exception, we may decline the request.
Correction of Inaccurate Data
If you believe that any personal data we have collected about you is inaccurate, you can request that we correct this data. However, we may refuse your request if we reasonably determine, based on all information available, that the data in question is accurate.
Opt-Out of Processing of Sensitive Personal Information
California residents have the right to request that we limit the processing of
Sensitive Personal Information (“SPI”).
We may collect some types of SPI, such as health-related information, for providing our services. If you wish to restrict how we use your SPI beyond the purposes allowed under the CCPA, you may exercise your

No Discrimination for Exercising CCPA Rights
We will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA. This means we will not:
Deny you Services.
Charge different prices or rates for services.
Provide a different level of service quality.
Additional Rights for California Residents
