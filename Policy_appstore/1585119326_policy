Privacy Policy and Notice
(Follco.com)
Version Number: 1.1
Creation Date: April 2019
Notice Owner: Follco.com
Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide you as our data subject with a statement regarding the Data Protection and Privacy practices and obligations of Follco Limited, [the Organisation] and an explanation of your rights as a data subject.  This Notice applies to our business practices, our websites (Websites), which are accessible from
www.follco.com
and its sub-domains, as well as any associated mobile applications (Mobile Apps) owned and controlled by the Organisation.  As the Organisation is established in the Republic of Ireland, this document is written in the vein of Irish Data Protection Law, as Follco Limited falls under the jurisdiction of the Irish Data Protection Commission.
This Privacy Policy and Notice sets out what Personal Data we collect and process about you in connection with the services and functions of the Organisation.  We will inform you of the following:
where we obtain the data from,
what we do with that data,
how we comply with the data protection rules,
who we transfer data to and
how we deal with individuals’ rights in relation to their Personal Data.
All our representatives, which include employees and contractors, are required to comply with this Privacy Policy and Notice when they process Personal Data on our behalf.
Please note that we may disclose individuals’ information to trusted third parties for the purposes set out and explained in this document.  We require all third parties to have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your Personal Data, in line with applicable Data Protection and Privacy Laws.  We will not disclose personal information to any third party without your consent or on one of the grounds listed herein, except in incidences where an individual is potentially at risk or where the law requires it.  We are not responsible for the content or the privacy notices for any websites that we provide external links to.
We need to demonstrate accountability for our data protection obligations.  This means that we must be able to show how we comply with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy Laws, and that we have in fact complied with the laws.  We do this, among other ways, by our written policies and procedures, by building data protection and privacy compliance into our systems and business rules, by internally monitoring our data protection and privacy compliance and keeping it under review, and by acting if our representatives, including employees or contractors, fail to follow the rules.  We also have certain obligations in relation to keeping records about our data processing.
These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted, and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis.  You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy and Notice periodically to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

Consent
By consenting, where this is the appropriate grounds, to our processing your Personal Data in line with this Privacy Policy and Notice you are giving us permission to process your Personal Data specifically for the purposes identified.
You may withdraw consent at any time by providing an unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify withdrawal of consent to the processing of Personal Data relating to you.  If you have any queries relating to withdrawing your consent, please contact our Data Protection Co-Ordinator using the contact details set out below.
Withdrawal of consent shall be without effect to the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Existence of Automated Decision-Making
Automated Decision-Making refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your Personal Data.  This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.  As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision-making.  Not all profiling results in automated decision-making, but it can do.  As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.
Marketing
We may use your Personal Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.  This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.  At the point at which you provide us with your Personal Data you will be asked whether you wish to receive any marketing communications from us.  You may withdraw this consent at any time.
We will not share your Personal Data with any third party for marketing purposes unless we have your explicit consent to do so.
You may object to direct marketing by using the contact details herein or links present in communications to opt-out of direct marketing.

Third Party Data Processors
We may use trusted third parties as data processors.  We require all third parties to have appropriate technical and operational security measures in place to protect your Personal Data, in line with applicable Data Protection and Privacy Laws.  Any such organisation or individual will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions but may not use it for any other purpose.
Specifically, we need to have written agreements in place with all our data processors and, before we sign each agreement, we need to have vetted and be satisfied with the processor’s data security.  The agreements also need to contain specific clauses that deal with data protection.
We use the following categories of data processors in the course of our business:
·
Cloud Service Provider, Cloud-based Support Services, Cloud-based Email Notification Services.
·
Professional Service Providers such as Lawyers, Solicitors and Accountants.

Other than the above, we will not disclose personal information to any third party without your consent except in incidences where an individual is potentially at risk or where the law requires it.
Information Received from Third Parties
Generally speaking, we do not receive information from Third Parties.  The Organisation allows businesses to register accounts on the online platform as well as consumers, separately.  The Organisation may upload or capture Personal Data of potential customers or existing customers on the platform.
Businesses warrant before capture that they have the correct permission to process your data into their account.  We are not responsible for obtaining your permission or consent to process your data when we act as the Data Processor for these businesses.
International Transfers
When we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
·
We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission.
·
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe.
·
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.
Data Retention
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for and generally for up to seven (7) years afterwards or otherwise permitted by applicable laws.  We may also retain your information during the period needed to complete our legitimate business operations, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Security of your Personal Data
We take appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorised processing of Personal Data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, Personal Data.
We have put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all Personal Data from the point of collection to the point of destruction.  Personal data will only be transferred to a data processor if they agree to comply with those procedures and policies, or if they put in place adequate measures himself.  In addition, we have appropriate written agreements in place with all our data processors.
We maintain data security by protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Personal Data, defined as follows:
·
Confidentiality means that only people who are authorised to use the data can access it.
·
Integrity means that Personal Data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed.
·
Availability means that authorised users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorised purposes.
We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your Personal Data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software networking, storage, and related technology required to run.  The data you provide to us is protected using modern encryption, intrusion prevention, and account access techniques.
Sale of Business
Situations may arise where it is necessary to transfer information (including your Personal Data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our organisation provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of the Privacy Policy and Notice and provided that the third party only uses your Personal Data for the purposes that you provided it to us.  The Personal Data transferred will be limited to that which is absolutely necessary.  You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out.
Children’s Personal Data
As an organisation, we do not allow children to use our services, transact on our platforms or be employed.
If you would like to make use of our services and you are not yet 18 years old, we require that an adult is present when you register.  Where consent is required to process your Personal Data as a child, we will obtain that consent from the adult who is authorised to give the consent on your behalf.
You must be at least 18 years old to create an account and engage in activities and transactions on our digital and social media.  By creating an account or engaging in activities or transactions on our digital and social media, you affirm that you are at least 18 years old and are fully able to enter and comply with our regular Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy and Notice.  If we are notified or learn that a child has submitted Personal Data to us through our digital or social media, we will delete such Personal Data.
What are the data protection rules
This Notice aims to ensure compliance with the rules as found in relevant Data Protection and Privacy Laws.  We aim to comply with the following in the EU:
·
Lawfulness, fairness and transparency – Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.
·
Purpose Limitation.  Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
·
Data minimisation – Personal Data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to purposes for which they are processed.
·
Accuracy – Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.  Inaccurate Personal Data should be corrected or deleted.
·
Retention – Personal data should be kept in an identifiable format for no longer than is necessary.
·
Integrity and confidentiality – Personal data should be kept secure.
Accountability – An important change for Data Controllers.  Under the GDPR, we must not only comply with       the above six general principles, but we must be able to demonstrate that we comply by documenting and     keeping records of all decisions.
Your Data Protection Rights
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “Data Subject access request”).  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.  This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal information.  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Object to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information.  This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”).  This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.
How You Exercise Your Rights
We have appointed a Data Protection Co-Ordinator to monitor compliance with our data protection obligations and with this Notice and our related policies.  If you have any questions about this Notice or about our data protection compliance, please contact the Data Protection Co-Ordinator.
Data subjects must make a formal request for Personal Data we hold about them or otherwise to exercise their data protections rights whether to make an access request or otherwise by contacting our Data Protection Co-Ordinator who will respond to the request within 30 days.
We are obliged to comply with exceptions to your requests where laid out in law.  Such exceptions relate to health data, disclosures that would be likely to cause serious harm to your physical or mental health or emotional condition and opinions given in confidence.
