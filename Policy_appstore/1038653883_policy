”) or visit our website, we collect information about you.
1. OUR CORE VALUES
We are driven by two core values when providing our products and services:
We highly value your privacy
. It means that all the features on Yubo have been built to be privacy-oriented from day one and so that we do not have to seek data that we do not need. It is called "
privacy by design
".

2. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
Twelve-App publishes Yubo, a social network that enables you to make friends and engage with them, in particular through live video. It also publishes
www.yubo.live
.
Twelve-App is the “controller” of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, unless specified otherwise. We are a French company and our head office is at 59 rue de Ponthieu, bureau 562, 75008 Paris, France.
3. DATA WE COLLECT
3.1. Data you provide to us directly
Sign-up data.
To use Yubo, you need to create an account. To do so, we ask you to provide basic personal information such as your phone number, name, and date of birth. You’ll need to pick a username and a password. We also require you to upload at least one profile picture showing your face, and to take a photo selfie to estimate your age from your facial features, to make sure that it is consistent with your birthdate.
We may offer a simplified sign-up process using Apple ID log-in or Google log-in. In this case, we will receive personal data from Apple or Google, such as your name, Google or Apple ID and your email address (you may choose not to provide some data depending on Google or Apple policies). Such data will only be used to set up your Yubo account.
You may also complete your profile with optional information: gender, emoji, bio, and email address. Users who are at least 18 years old can also provide information on their profession and education.
Private details like your email address, your birthdate, your phone number, your gender and the photo selfie used for age estimation are not publicly visible.
Your interaction(s) with us.
If you report a user or content on Yubo, request help, make a claim, participate in a survey or exercise your privacy rights (as mentioned in Section 9 below), we will process the information contained therein. We will also process information if another user reports you. This kind of information is not shared nor visible to other users.
Profile verification.
On Yubo, you can verify your profile to get a yellow checkmark on your profile. This will help other users know that your profile is legitimate and not fake. We can also require you to get verified if there is a serious safety concern related to your account. To verify your profile, we need a valid ID, as well as a selfie that we will compare with the photos in your profile. You can choose to be verified manually by a specialist or automatically using our technology. If you choose the automated option, and if you consent, we will collect your facial geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some countries. The automated option is not available for users under 16 years old.
Your location (GPS coordinates).
Subject to your consent, we collect and process data concerning your location. This allows you, depending on your settings, to display the city where you are located in your profile and to add people around you as friends. In addition, this location service based on GPS data is not available to users under 15 years old. Other restrictions may apply depending on your age, country and applicable laws.
Your approximate location (IP Address)
: If geolocation based on GPS data is not activated or is not available to you as explained above, we collect your approximate location - such as your city - derived from your IP address to deliver a better experience.
The contents you share on Yubo.
When you use features available on Yubo we will process and store the contents you share such as photos, videostream and messages. We also need to process the technical data associated with the content you post (such as the date, device information, IP address).
You should always be aware that the content you share on Yubo may be viewed by other users with whom you are interacting, who may save your content through their device (for example by taking a screenshot of their phone).
When using Yubo, we do not encourage you to share sensitive information such as data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, your political opinions, religious beliefs, or data concerning your health, your sex life, or your sexual orientation.
It is, however, your freedom of expression to do so as long as you respect the rules in force on the platform. In this case, you should be aware that you are manifestly making this information public.
Access to your camera, photos, and videos.
In order to send and upload your photos or videos from your device and use the live video feature, we need your permission to access your media and your camera.
3.2. Data we collect automatically when you use our services
Information on user acquisition.
With your permission, we collect technical information such as your advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset in your device’s settings) to help us measure the performance of our marketing campaigns and attribution (more information in Section 4.3 below).
Information about your activity on Yubo.
Your use of our services leads to the collection of the following data:
the YUBO id associated with your account,
the date you signed up,

your interactions with the YUBO features and other users (such as the number of likes or dislikes via the swipe feature).

Other users.
We may receive information from other users, especially in user-generated content, support requests and user reports.
Business partners.

4. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
We mostly need to access, use and/or share your personal data to provide you with the services offered on Yubo and to create a safe, smooth and high-quality experience for you. To give you more details and examples, you can read below the list of purposes for which your data may be used.
4.1. To manage your account and your relationship with Yubo, and to make the app features available to you
Create and manage your user account (including access to Yubo services and Help). Depending on your jurisdiction, we may request parental permission before you can use Yubo.
Allow you to enjoy the features available on Yubo and that you request, including watching or streaming live videos, using the swipes to make new friends, adding fun content in your profile or in other features, sending messages and photos to your friends, purchase paid items and/or subscriptions if you wish. We may also offer services provided by third parties. In particular, we allow you to broadcast videos from YouTube, via the YouTube API Services. For more information on how YouTube processes your data, please consult YouTube’s privacy policy here:
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy
.
If you want to, get your account verified to get a yellow checkmark (see Section 3.1. for more information on profile verification).
Get your account ‘verified’. If you choose to have a verified account, we will use your facial geometry (considered Biometric Information in some jurisdictions) to compare your selfie to your profile photos. This helps us verify that you are not a fake profile.
Manage and store messages exchanged between users who have become friends and live videos.
Where appropriate, show you offers and content we think you’ll like, in particular when using certain paid services (e.g., Yubo’s ‘Power Pack’);
Manage and respond to your requests, questions and complaints addressed to our support team.
We rely on our
Terms of Use
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.1. Remember that these terms constitute a contract between you and Twelve-App.
In addition, we ask for your
consent
where required to by law. Typically, this may occur if we need parental consent for you to join Yubo in some jurisdictions. Also, if you choose the automated verification option, we ask for your consent to verify your profile because facial geometry data analysis may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions.
4.2. To improve our services and the user experience
Measure how you use our services, which features you like the most, which ones you like less, make usage statistics of our app, and analyze them.
Create and develop new features on Yubo, and perform tests before launching new features.
Understand the technical issues you may encounter, to resolve them.
Manage our internal communication and marketing activities, such as the animation of the Yubo community, or internal statistical studies.
Evaluate the quality of our responses when you contact our support team.
Suggest your profile to other users and show you profiles to make new friends, based on your settings, location, activity and profile information.
Improve the user experience, the technical operation of the app, and the way users can communicate through the app.
We rely on
Twelve-App’s legitimate interests
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.2. so that we understand your expectations and make your experience on Yubo fun and smooth.
4.3. To provide tailored services and access to some information from your device
Personalization of services according to location data, to show you live videos nearby, or suggestions of friends nearby. The distance cannot be less than 30km.
Access to your device's photo album, camera and micro to share images, videos and sound on Yubo.
To improve the quality of our augmented reality experiences, information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time. We don’t store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.
Help us measure the performance of our marketing campaigns and attribution. It allows us for example to determine from which site or app you downloaded Yubo. Consult our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
Send you push notifications containing information about our products, safety updates, and interactions with other users.
Show you ads (i) so you can use free features on Yubo and (ii) to allow you to participate in the Ads with Rewards program if you wish, giving you the opportunity to earn YuBucks by viewing ads. These ad programs may not be available to all users, depending on their age, country, and applicable laws. Check out our
Cookie Policy
for more information.
We rely on your
consent
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.3 where consent is the legal basis required under applicable laws.
You may withdraw your consent whenever you want or opt out of the processing of your data (depending on applicable laws). Your consent or right to opt out is usually managed via the settings of Yubo and/or of your device.
4.4. To ensure and enhance online safety on Yubo
Enforcement of policies to moderate content and profiles that go against our
Community Guidelines
. We can review your profile and activity and take action in the event of a safety issue. This may include actions like sending you a warning, removing or filtering inappropriate content,  requiring you to get verified, or suspending your account temporarily or permanently. Actions that may materially affect your use of Yubo (such as a permanent ban) are decided by moderators, according to our internal policies. Some content can be automatically filtered to prevent users from being exposed to it. We may take security measures on Yubo based on your activity on a third-party platform that is brought to our attention.
Development and use of automated technologies to detect violations of our
Community Guidelines
and/or manifestly illicit content
. These technologies can scan content (notably text, photos and videos) and detect violations of our rules. We strive to detect violations such as violence, drug use, child abuse, spam, and sexually explicit, hateful, or discriminatory content as quickly as possible, even before they are reported. These tools support our moderation efforts and allow us to take immediate action when such violations happen.
Development and implementation of procedures and technologies to fight against fraudulent profiles, and to appropriately identify our users
.
To this end:
- We automatically detect if your profile picture shows your face.
- We will ask you to verify your identity before accessing your Yubo account if we have reasonable doubts about you based on your activity and your profile information.
- We also request to estimate your age from a picture of your face. Our facial age estimation is an age-checking technology provided by our partner Yoti that can estimate a person’s age by algorithmically assessing their facial features. We only receive the result of the age estimation carried out by Yoti, who does not keep the photo or any facial geometry data.
Account tracking
. We temporarily flag users who we believe are engaging in unsafe or unlawful conduct on Yubo. Flagging these accounts allows our moderators to conduct investigations and take moderation action, if necessary.
Evaluation of the performance of our safety procedures, policies, and technologies
mentioned in this Section 4.4, in order to improve them and develop new ones that we think could be more effective in improving your well-being and safety on Yubo. This includes, for example, the quality review of the work done by our moderators and support specialists, and training of our automated technologies to improve their accuracy over time.
We rely on
Twelve-App’s legitimate interests
as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.4. so that Yubo remains a safe and respectful place of expression and safeguards the trust of our users.
We also rely on our
Terms of Use
to enforce them in the event of a violation of our Terms of Service and/or our
Community Guidelines
.
In jurisdictions where analysis of a photo for age estimation or profile verification purposes is considered biometric data, we request your
consent
to process this information.
4.5. To comply with our legal obligations and cooperate with authorities.
Implementation of a reporting functionality available to users
and embedded in all app’s features. This allows you to report users or content that you believe violates our
Community Guidelines
. The reports you submit will then be reviewed by our moderators, who will take action against the reported content or user where appropriate.
Assist law enforcement and remove manifestly unlawful content
. We are required to contribute to the fight against criminal offenses online, to promptly remove or disable access to unlawful content as soon as we become aware of it, to notify competent authorities of some types of infringements, and to preserve data for investigations upon request.
Compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirement
. This notably includes the processing of your requests to exercise your privacy rights in accordance with Section 9.
We rely on
the relevant legal obligation
to which we are subject as a legal basis for processing your personal data under this Section 4.5.
Also note that, if necessary, we will use personal information to exercise or defend our legal rights in court, relying on our
legitimate interest(s)
.
4.6. To manage life-threatening emergency situations for anyone using our services
.
Report to competent authorities
. We will report situations or content presenting a life threat (such as self-harm or violence) to the competent authorities. Our moderators are trained to identify situations requiring urgent reporting to authorities, depending on the context; they create internal reports to be examined before being transmitted to the competent authorities.
User assistance
. Our specialists provide users in distress with relevant information and documentation.
We rely on the protection of the
vital interests
of any natural person as a legal basis for processing personal data under this Section 4.6.

5.1. Account Validity Period
We keep your personal information as long as we need it to enable you to use our services.

meaning that you do not access the app for a continuous period of two years.
5.2. Specific Data Retention Periods
Not all the data we process have the same retention period, in particular regarding the following types of data:
Direct messages are deleted after two years and photos sent in the chat are deleted after one year.
Videos and images from live videos are deleted quickly (within minutes to hours). Only screenshots of the live videos may be kept longer if the live videos are reported or if violations of our
Community Guidelines
are detected.
We will retain content that is in violation of our Community Guidelines for a certain period of time, even if that content has been removed from the Yubo platform. The retention period may vary depending on the type of content and the type of violation.
Your interactions with our support team can be kept for up to 5 years after the ticket is closed. It helps us follow up on our actions regarding support and defend ourselves in the event of a claim or legal action.
Your geolocation (i.e. your device’s GPS data), if enabled, is kept until your next access to Yubo; then it is replaced by your current geolocation.
Verification data: ID documents to verify an account are deleted a few days after verification. Facial geometry scans are immediately deleted after the process. We only store your real-time selfie image as long as your profile remains active on Yubo to maintain your verification.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. above, we will retain some personal data for an additional period of time if we are legally required to do so. We may also need to keep personal information for the time necessary to resolve a dispute or to exercise or defend our legal rights.

regarding your personal data and privacy rights.
Rule #1: Data at a Minimum.
We need some data like a picture of your face and your date of birth to identify you on Yubo for everyone's safety.
We also process some information related to your device for technical reasons and data related to the content you post on Yubo, so we can share it with other users on the platform.
You do not have to provide us with any information that we do not absolutely need, such as your email address, interests, gender, etc. All of this information is optional.
Rule #2: Data Sharing Practices.
We share users’ personal data mainly with our service providers. These companies provide us with IT tools that process data to help us run our services. For example, to host the data in data centers, or to sort and analyze data in databases.
User data can be accessed by our authorized employees, for example by our moderators who ensure safety on the app.
Data is also shared with business partners, especially to serve ads on the app. In this example, these are companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and platforms like Yubo. Ads may not be shown to all users depending on their age and local restrictions.
Finally, personal data may be shared with the relevant authorities if serious offenses are committed on Yubo.
Rule #3: Data for Your Safety
Moderation is necessary for the safety of everyone on Yubo. We have to process personal data in order to moderate content. For example, if a content violates our
Community Guidelines
, our moderators must identify the content in violation and apply necessary actions to the user.
We also use technology to automatically detect violations of our guidelines, filter inappropriate content, or send you alerts to remind you of our rules, and also to automatically verify your age when you sign up.
We train and supervise the algorithms so that they perform well and make as few errors as possible. Content detected by the algorithms may be processed not only for safety purposes but also to improve their accuracy and our safety measures.
Children who are 13 years old or younger are not allowed to use Yubo.
Therefore, we require you to estimate your age at sign-up via a partnership with Yoti, an industry-leading age estimation system. We may also require you to verify your identity if we suspect that you lied about your age or if you are engaged in inappropriate or unlawful conduct on Yubo.

Rule #4: Data for a Better Experience.
We only use your data to provide our services and improve your experience on Yubo. You can set your swipe or live video settings as you wish, and you can post content on Yubo like your bio, a private message, or a video. We need to store this content on our servers so that it can function online.
To improve the platform we watch trends, notice how you use Yubo, what features you like and dislike, and other usage metrics. We are not interested in getting to know your individual activity, but rather understand how our community uses Yubo so we can grow the app in that direction.
Rule #5: No Geolocation of Under 15s.
Location services allow us to locate you to give you a better experience on the app.
The geolocation options we offer may vary according to your country, your age, and applicable laws. We can provide (i) a geolocation service (based on the GPS coordinates of your device) subject to your prior consent, or (ii) an approximate location service (based on your IP address).
Rule #6: Your Settings, Your Privacy.
Yubo is designed with privacy protection at its core. This means that you can control your data through the in-app settings:
Go to ‘
Account
’ if you’d like to rectify some data;
Go to ‘
Safety and Privacy
’ if you’d like to manage your permissions, blocked users, add or remove muted words, or request your data.
Go to ‘
Push notifications
’ if you’d like to allow us, or not, to send you notifications.
Go to ‘
Swipe settings
’ if you’d like to manage swipe specification or if you would prefer us to hide your profile from appearing in swipes..
Go to ‘
Delete Account
’ if you’d like to leave Yubo and remove your profile.
If you are under 18, we strongly encourage you to ask your parents or a trusted adult before changing your privacy settings, especially if you wish to lower them.

Rule #7: Cookies for improved performance
We use technologies like cookies to track your interactions and actions on Yubo. For example, to see what features you have used, to figure out what you like and dislike on the app, and to better the ads you will see. It also allows us to identify any technical problems you may be experiencing.
Basically, these tools can collect technical information (like your phone model or operating system) and it helps us improve the app and your experience on Yubo.

Rule #8: Our Commitment to Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations.
As you may know, Yubo is available in many countries, where data protection laws may vary. For instance:
The
General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’)
applies throughout the European Union, and the
UK General Data Protection Regulation
applies in the United Kingdom.
State privacy laws apply in the United States of America, such as the
Consumer California Privacy Act
, the
Colorado Privacy Act
, the
Connecticut Act Concerning Privacy and Online Monitoring
, the
Utah Consumer Privacy Act
, and the
Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act
.
We take into account local requirements when providing our services. However, be aware that your rights may be different depending on your country of residence.
