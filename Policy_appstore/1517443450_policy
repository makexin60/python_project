the country that we send the data to might be approved by the UK government as offering an adequate level of protection for personal data;

You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal data when it is transferred outside the UKby contacting us using the

10.
How we safeguard your information
We have extensive controls in place to maintain the security of our information and information systems. Files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity of the relevant information, including hashing or data encryption where appropriate. Appropriate controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems. Physical access to areas where Personal Data is gathered, processed or stored is limited to authorised employees and independent contractors.
As a condition of employment or engagement, our employees and independent contractors are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including in relation to data protection law. Unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information (including personal data) by an employee of Aardman is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.
If you contact us about your information, you may be asked for some personal data for identification purposes. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to your information.
11.
Internet risks
Despite the safeguards set out in this Privacy Policy, u
nfortunately the transmission of information by online or mobile means is not completely secure. Aardman cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to or through this App, and for that reason any transmission you make is at your own risk. We recommend that you use anti-virus, firewall and/or other security protections according to your own analysis of your security requirements. Once we have received your personal data we will use the procedures and security features set out in this Privacy Policy to try to prevent unauthorised access to, or loss or destruction of, your personal data.
12.
How long we keep your Personal Data
How long we will hold your personal data for will vary and will be determined by the following criteria:
·
the purpose for which we are using it (as further described in this Privacy Policy) – we will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and
·
legal obligations – laws or regulations may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your personal data.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
13.
Your rights
Where we collect, use or store your personal data under this Privacy Policy you may, depending on your circumstances, have the following rights:
·
the right to obtain information regarding the processing of your personal data (including whether or not we are holding and/or processing your personal data, the extent of the personal data we are holding and the purposes and extent of the processing) and access to the personal data which we hold about you, if any;
·
where we are relying on consent for a particular purpose, the right at any time to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data for such purpose;
·
in some circumstances, the right to receive some personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or request that we transmit those data to a third party where this is technically feasible – which is sometimes known as the right to “data portability”, and please note that (a) this right only applies to personal data which you have provided directly to Aardman and which we are processing either on the basis of consent or because the processing is necessary in order for us to perform our contractual obligations to you and (b) if you request the right to data portability and it is not available to you, we will let you know;
·
the right to request that we rectify your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete;
·
the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances - please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your personal data but we are legally entitled to retain it, in which case we will let you know;
·
the right to object to, or request that we restrict, our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances - again, there may be circumstances where you object to, or ask us to restrict, our processing of your personal data but we are legally entitled to refuse that request, and if so we will let you know;
·
the right to object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produce legal effects or otherwise significantly affect you (for example, where a computer algorithm, rather than a person, makes decisions that affect your contractual or other rights) – please note that we do not currently carry out any such automated decision-making processes;
·
the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator if you think that any of your rights have been infringed by us, and please note that:
o
the data protection regulator for the UK is the information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”);
o
you can submit complaints through the ICO helpline by calling 0303 123 1113; and
o
further information on reporting concerns is available at
https://ico.org.uk/concerns/
.
To find out more about your legal rights, pelase see the ICO’s website (

).
You can exercise your rights above at any time by contacting us at Aardman Animations Limited, Gas Ferry Road, Bristol, BS1 6UN or
privacy@aardman.com
, giving us enough information to identify you and respond to your request.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). We may, however, charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in those circumstances.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we shall notify you and keep you updated.
14.

If you follow a link to another website, app or service (including any other website or app operated by Aardman), different privacy policies may apply. You should read these policies before you submit any personal data to those other websites or apps and please note that use of your personal data by those webites will be subject to those privacy policies.
