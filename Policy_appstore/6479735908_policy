Legal grounds for the processing of your personal data vary depending on the specific group of data and the purposes for processing it. Note that we may be processing the same personal data for several purposes simultaneously and, respectively, on more than one legal ground.
3.1.1. Contract.

3.1.3. Legitimate interests. Processing of your personal data is necessary for pursuing legitimate interests of Fleet DATA or the legitimate interests of third parties, always ensuring that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your data for marketing purposes based on our legitimate interest of developing and improving our business. Other legitimate interests include maintaining Service to meet the needs of our users and clients, advertising to make our Service freely available for users, detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, security and technical issues with the Service, fulfilling obligations to our partners, enforcing legal claims, etc.
