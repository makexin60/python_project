Accurx Privacy Policy
Who are we?
We are Accurx Limited. We provide software to enable health and social care teams to communicate with each other and with patients. Our company details and our registration with the UK’s Data Protection Regulator (the ICO) can be found
here
.
Your trust in our data security and privacy is at the heart of what we do. It's not enough to ask you to trust us, we have to show that we are trustworthy. Being transparent about what we do with any personal data needed to provide our software is key to that.
This page tells you what we do. Please see the following groups below  to see how we use data about you:
Health and Care Professionals
Patients
Prospective buyers from healthcare organisations
User/ Market Research Participants
This notice may change periodically and will be published on the Accurx website.
Roles
Health and Care Professionals
Accurx is a communication software provider for healthcare organisations like your employer - perhaps a GP practice, hospital Trust or pharmacy. If you’re a member of staff here that uses Accurx, we receive information about you in three ways:
Accurx account registration - when you sign up, or are signed up for, an Accurx account
ongoing use of the Accurx platform
if you contact us directly, for example through our email or chat platform
Accurx registration
Upon creating an Accurx account using our sign up page, we collect the following information about you and link this to a unique identifier in our system:
Full name
Email
Organisation
Telephone number
Why
: We collect this information on the basis of legitimate interest to be ready to link your profile to your organisation (after which, we process your data as a data processor). If you are a user of our products, we may also contact you from time to time to let you know about our products, services, events, and to also ask for your feedback. In cases where we contact you for marketing purposes, we rely on our legitimate interests to help our user base connect with each other, grow our business, improve multidisciplinary team communication and have a positive impact on patient care to do this. You can also ask us to remove or update your contact details at any time, by contacting us at
support@accurx.com
.
Ongoing use for your work in a healthcare organisation
We provide software products to healthcare organisations. These healthcare organisations are responsible for how your information is used in our platform - in legal language, they are the “Data Controller”. They provide us with information and instruct us how to use it. This means we’re acting as a “Data Processor”. When your registration (above) is linked to an organisation, we link the data to other information about you, provided by yourself or your organisation, including your job role, and actions you’ve taken in Accurx software. We have a very clear agreement with your healthcare provider that sets out what we do with the data, and how we keep it safe. We also passively monitor use of our platform to ensure we remain compliant with the agreements in place with our healthcare providers, and our acceptable use policy. You can read the full agreement
here
.
Switch App users
When you sign up to use the Switch application, we will collect the following registration information about you:
Name
Email address
Organisation
The Switch App enables you to find contact details for your colleagues via a crowd-sourced directory, and communicate with each other. If you add someone else's contact details to our crowd-sourced directory, it's important you make sure they wouldn't object to their details being added.
Accurx is the controller over your registration information and the crowd-sourced directory in our App. The healthcare organisation is the Controller of any personal data, including patient data, processed within the App, or in other Accurx suite of products that can be accessed via the App.
Why:
We rely on your consent to process your information when you sign up and use the App, which you can revoke at any time by deleting the app or by contacting us at
support@accurx.com
. If you are a user of the App, we may also contact you from time to time to ask for your feedback, and let you know about our other products, services, events, and to also ask for your feedback. If your data is stored in our directory or we contact you for marketing purposes, we rely on our legitimate interests to help our user base connect with each other, grow our business, improve multidisciplinary team communication and have a positive impact on patient care to do this. You can also ask for us to remove or update your data stored in our directory at any time, by contacting us at
support@accurx.com
.
