We will also keep data which cannot directly or indirectly identify living individuals for analytics and research purposes to help improve our products and services.
Cross-border Data Transfers
Third party service providers contracted by Pinergy hold personal data in secure data centres inside the EEA. Where data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, such transfers are carried out on the basis of either:
Standard Contractual Clauses, or
An adequacy decision of the European Commission.
In addition, registering user profiles for certain applications provided by equipment providers for certain products may necessitate transfer of your personal data to the UK or other jurisdictions outside the EU/EEA with different data protection regimes to that which applies in Ireland or the EU.
In such cases, your registration for the app may be necessary for the provision of service to you by the equipment provider. They may also require registration of your equipment for warranty or after-sales support purposes.
We regularly review our providers and the basis for any transfers of personal data outside the EEA.
Keeping Your Data Safe and Secure
We place great importance on the security of all personal data associated with our customers. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.
Periodic reviews of our security standards are carried out and our software development process has a checkpoint to identify and new risks when we define / develop new features.
However, with any electronic transmission and storage of data comes risks and we cannot guarantee that our databases, or those of our third-party affiliates, will be 100% secure. There is also a risk of data being intercepted while being transferred over the internet.
In the event of a breach of data security, Pinergy will:
Where we are acting as a Data Controller, we will notify without undue delay the relevant Supervisory Authority where we identify that there is a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of people using our applications or services
Where we are acting as a Data Controller and we identify a high risk to your rights and freedoms we will notify you of the incident without undue delay.

Profiling and analytics is carried on the basis of half hourly consumption data with consent. If you have not consented to the recording of half-hourly consumption data, this data collected every two months.
No decisions are taken based solely on automated decision making which would have a legal or equally significant impact on a user as the data is used for creating insights on energy consumption.
The exception to this is in the context of pre-pay electricity services where service will be discontinued once the available credit reaches zero or another agreed credit threshold, or post-paid services where an account has outstanding bills. This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between us as the Data Controller and the data subject as a user of our services.

This data protection notice provides additional information specific to Acutrace Ltd and how we process data relating to individuals.
This should be read along side the general Data Protection Notice for all Pinergy companies.
What we do

Our purposes for processing your personal data
In general, Acutrace does not process personal data, but data we process may related to potentially identifiable individuals if data is reported at the level of an individual address or meter point which can then be linked to an identified or identifiable individual.
In general, we process personal data of customers or people who are identified to us as people we can contact in relation to a customer:
Provision of Electricity Consumption Data
For commercial customers, we will process data about properties in aggregate or de-identified form to provide energy consumption and energy efficiency statistics and reporting. This processing will, in general, not result in the processing of identified or identifiable personal data.
Acutrace implements appropriate organisational and technical controls to ensure that data that is processed for statistical reporting purposes is de-identified or is aggregated to mitigate against the risk of individuals being identified from the data.
Customer Support
Acutrace will process personal data of individuals in client companies for the purposes of executing projects or providing support on analytics services that are provided.
This data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interest to contact customers to manage our commercial relationship with a business customer.

This includes information like your name, your business address, your email address, or your phone number.
Customer Electricity Consumption and Generation Data
We process data about the electricity consumption and generation for customers and prospective customers.
For prospective customers we process data about your recent and average energy consumption as part of our sales process to help us identify the best tariffs or solutions for customers or design the most appropriate energy system for you. This information is usually obtained from recent electricity bills you provide to us.
As part of our ongoing provision of service to customers we will process data about their consumption and generation of electricity. This data will include volume of electricity consumed or generated at 15 or 30 minute intervals associated to a meter point reference number.
Where do we get your personal data from?
We get your personal data from a number of sources:
From you directly, or from someone authorised to act on your behalf
Acutrace will obtain personal data of customer contacts either directly from you or from one of the other Pinergy companies.

We will record certain data, which may include personal data, as part of calls, reviews of email or other correspondence, or from customer site visits.
From your use of electricity or other products and services provided by us
Your use of electricity and your use of other products or services provided by Pinergy companies will provide us with data relating to you and your use of our products and services.
Who else do we give your data to?
Acutrace does not disclose personal data to any 3
rd
parties.
In addition, the following categories of 3
rd
party may receive data from us for certain purposes, e.g. for statistical reporting or for the purposes of compliance with legal obligations. Except where it is not possible to comply with a request without disclosing personal data, data is only provided to 3

Government Departments / Agencies
ESB Networks
Law Enforcement Agencies

Do we transfer personal data outside the EU?
We use many computer systems and technologies to deliver services to you and to run our business. Some of these can involve transfers of data outside the EU.
When this happens, we ensure that there is a valid legal basis in place for such transfers. Methods used include Standard Contractual Clauses or, where necessary, relevant case by case exceptions under Article 49 of GDPR.
How long do we keep your personal data?
As the personal data that Acutrace processes relates to commercial customers and our interactions with them, Acutrace keeps personal data of customer contacts for:
The duration of the customer relationship plus seven years
For seven years after we are advised a contact person has left a client organisation, after which we review the retention of that data.
