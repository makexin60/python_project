Catch It app privacy notice
Who will own my data once I submit it?
University of Liverpool
Why do you need my information?
The Catch It app allows users to enter information into a mood diary and reflect on their emotions by being guided through a series of steps. The Catch It app does not request any personally identifiable information to be entered into the app.
What allows you to use my information?
Users of Catch It can consent to share the information they enter into the app anonymously to support mental health research. If this is done, the information will be used for research. If consent is not given, the information will only be used to populate the app for the individual user; it will not be used for any other reason, and will not be shared with anyone.
Who will my information be shared with?
Only if consent for research purposes is given, anonymised information will be shared with approved researchers. Sharing data for research purposes is completely optional and there are no consequences if you decide not to do so.
Do I have to provide this information and what will happen if I don’t?
Whilst data is stored securely, we strongly recommend no personally identifiable information (such as your name or the names of other people) is entered into the app. You do not need to provide this information to use the app and there is no account creation requited to access the app.
How long will you keep this data for and why?
We will keep your anonymised data for 10 years, in line with university policy.
How will my information be stored?
Anonymous information is stored on secure University servers.
Will this information be used to take automated decisions about me?
The app returns messages based on how moods change after reflection, but no automated decisions are made about you based on the information you make in the app.
Will my data be transferred abroad and why?
No.
