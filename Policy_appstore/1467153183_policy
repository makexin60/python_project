Privacy policy
Last Updated: July 15, 2021
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Goodsize Inc. in connection with the mobile applications ‘in3D:Avatar Creator Pro’ in App Store and Google Play Store and 'Create Avatar: in3D' in App Store and Google Play Store (the «App»), and
in3D.io
website (the «Site»).
Welcome to Goodsize’s Privacy Policy!
If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about Goodsize’s privacy practices:
The App is 3D body scanning for creating virtual body avatars.
Due to the limited processing resources available on mobile devices, we use third-party cloud providers – specifically, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services – to process and edit photographs and videos.
The App only uploads to the cloud the video and photos that you specifically record using the App.
Videos and photos are encrypted using a key stored locally on your mobile device.
We do not use the videos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the 3D body scanning functionality of the App or to use anonimized data internally for the technology improvement.
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please email at
hello@in3d.io
.
Here’s more on our privacy practices. Individuals located in the
European Economic Area
should also read our Notice to European Users below.

California Residents’ Privacy Rights
Except as excluded from the scope of this notice above, the CCPA grants California residents the following rights.
Information.
You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared and used your personal information during the past 12 months. We have made this this information available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this notice, in the above chart.
Access.
You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.
Deletion.
You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.
Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
How to Submit a Request
To request access to or deletion of personal information:

Identity verification.
The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request. We may attempt to verify your identify by asking you to confirm information that we have on file about you or your interactions with us. Where we ask for additional personal information to verify your identity, we will only use it to verify your identity or your authority to make the request on behalf of another consumer.
Authorized agents.
California residents can empower an «authorized agent» to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have written authorization confirming such authority.
