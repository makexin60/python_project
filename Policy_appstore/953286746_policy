Privacy Policy
Short and Simple, as all privacy policies ought to be.
When you first use Darkroom, we ask you for access to your photo library so we can read your photos and modify them. Photo data is extremely sensitive, and we believe itâ€™s important for you to know and understand what we do with that data.
At Darkroom, we firmly believe that your data belongs to you. As such, Darkroom does not collect, store, or share any images, or data that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual. We do not have advertisers, nor do we require an account to use Darkroom. All information that we do collect is usage and analytics data that is
anonymized
, generic, and used to help us improve the quality of Darkroom. We never upload your photos.
App Analytics
We use
App Store Connect
,
Google Firebase
, and
RevenueCat
to help improve the app. Each provides us with anonymized and generic usage and or transaction data that we use to inform our product decisions and understand how people are using Darkroom.
