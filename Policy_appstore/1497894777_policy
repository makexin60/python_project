General
Calo recognizes that the protection of privacy is a major concern to many of our customers and wants you to know how we acquire personal information through the App and how we use, share and protect that information. By using this App, you are consenting to the information collection, use and disclosure practices described below.
Types of information gathered
We may gather personal information(i) that you give to us voluntarily while using the App(ii) when you purchase, order, return, exchange or request information about our products and services while using the App; (iii) when you participate in interactive features of the App(iv) when you sign up for our e - mails, mobile messages, or social media notifications as described in the section titled “Social Media Notification” below; (v) when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to one of our surveys, or participate in a focus group as described in more detail under the section titled “Surveys and Polls” below; or(vi) when you provide us with comments, suggestions, or other input. During such activities, we may collect personal information about you that is not publicly available and can identify you, such as your name, mailing address, email address and phone number, birth date, and dietary restrictions.
Registration
In order for you to receive certain benefits of our App you may first be asked to supply certain information such as your city, zip code or other location - related information. We want to supply you with information that benefits you and the more relevant information we have about you, the better we are able to do this. We distribute an electronic newsletter, personalized content, notifications and recommendations and may launch additional products in the future. When you subscribe to our service, you will be asked for certain information so that we can customize the information you receive to suit your needs. Upon registering for our service, you will be asked for your name, email address, zip code, and other information specified in the enrollment process. You may be asked to tell us a little about your dietary restrictions, and other questions of this nature. This information is used to deliver personalized information that we believe will be of interest to you. The more of this information you choose to share with us, the better we can craft information specifically for you.
Social media notification
To enable our push notification and other mobile communication services, we may collect and store device IDs to identify each unique mobile device that registers for our service, including for example, device tokens from iOS devices, Live IDs from Windows devices, and other similar identifications from devices running on other platforms. These IDs cannot be tracked back to you, but are tied to a specific device which may only be used by one person. We may collect information including location - related information, internet protocol addresses, mobile device models, carrier information, the operating system of your mobile devices and other non - personally identifiable information.
Surveys and polls
From time to time, users of the App may be asked to participate in voluntary surveys and polls. As a part of this process you may be asked to supply personal information such as demographic information and lifestyle preferences. These surveys will be strictly voluntary and you can choose to disclose this information or not.
Use of information
We may use information gathered through the App to: (i) fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, returns, exchanges and requests for information; (ii) deliver coupons, mobile coupons, newsletters, in -store messages, emails and mobile messages including, for example, by push notification or other mobile communications; (iii) send marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions; (iv) improve the effectiveness of our App, website, stores, mobile experience and marketing efforts; (v) conduct research and analysis, including focus groups and surveys; (vi) administer sweepstakes and contests; (vii) prevent fraudulent transactions and monitor against theft; and(viii) assist law enforcement and respond to subpoenas.
Deletion of Personal Data
You may request for your information to be deleted at anytime by clicking "Delete my Account" via the application. Upon clicking delete we will accept your request and erase all of your personal information from our all records and systems as soon as reasonably practicable, in accordance with data protection laws and regulations.
Sharing of information
We may share some or all of your personal information with our affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, we may transfer your personal information to that company and that company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy unless and until it is modified as set forth herein. We will not sell or otherwise share personally identifying information with other people or nonaffiliated companies except for those purposes described herein, or as required by law. However, we will share this information with certain business partners to provide requested services that we do not provide directly. In addition, we may share aggregate data collected through the App that does not personally identify any party with our research partner, and may from time to time share this type of data with other business partners. Also, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, or to protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
Google Analytics
We use the User - ID feature of Google Analytics to help us enhance your user experience. User - ID lets us associate a persistent ID for you with your engagement data from one or more sessions initiated from one or more devices. This ability to stitch together your contacts with us into a single thread also provides us with a more unified, holistic story about your relationship with our business. We will use information received through our use of User - ID in the manner described under “Use of Information” above. If you would like to opt - out of our use of this service, you may do so by following the instructions found under “Updating Personal Information” below.
Health Data
We may collect several physical and fitness data that includes your Active & Resting Energy, Steps, Weight and Workouts, either directly from you or from Apple Health or Google Fit, if you choose to provide such information. We use such data to provide you with your Calories out value. Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, (i) we use Health Data only to provide the Service and not for advertising, (ii) we store Health Data only to enhance features and not for any third party, and (iii) we will not disclose Health Data for advertising, marketing, or use-based data that is not needed to provide the Service.
Information from Public Forums
Any information you submit in a blog, chat room, social network or other public forum can be read, collected, or used by us and others, including, for example, to personalize your experience on our App. You are responsible for the information you disclose in these forums and such information is not protected under these Terms & Conditions.
Privacy of Mobile Applications
Our App may include functionality to allow you to create a shopping list, search or add products to a favorites list, check price or product availability, print coupons and engage in a wide variety of other activities and services.

You must first provide permission through your device before our App obtains such location information from technologies like GPS, Wi - Fi, or cell tower proximity(or a combination of these technologies). We, and our service providers, may use and store this information, in combination with other location - based information such as the IP address and billing or postal code provided by you at time of your App registration, to provide enhanced location based services, such as store specific services, search results, and other content. You can stop all collection of information by our App easily by uninstalling the App. Also, you may at any time opt - out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
