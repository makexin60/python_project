not
apply to personal information that our customers, along with their employees, contractors, and other personnel (collectively, “
Workers
”) provide to us to process on the customer’s behalf (collectively, “
Customer Data
”). Rather, our customers’ respective privacy policies (such as their employee privacy notices) govern their collection and use of Customer Data, and our processing of Customer Data is governed by the contracts that we have in place with our customers, not this Privacy Policy.

Worker Biometric data (fingerprint),
which may be collected in order to authenticate or to identify Workers. (Note: where required by law, we will delete Workers’ biometric information within 3 years from the Worker’s last interaction with our Services.)
Precise Geolocation data
, which may be collected to determine if a Worker’s time registration is “valid” and that a Worker is registering their time where their employer expects them to be working.
Any questions or requests relating to Customer Data should be directed to our customers.

What information do we collect?
Our online recruiting system collects details about you to aid in the hiring process. Information we collect may include:
Your name
Your email address, mailing address, and primary phone number
The name and address of your current employer
Names, contact information, and addresses for previous employers
Information about your level of work experience and level of education
The type of job you are looking for, desired salary, and data of availability
Whether you are available for relocation if hired
Whether you are legally allowed to work in a country without sponsorship
How you heard about the open position
Your prior history, if any, of applying and/or interviewing for WorkForce Software positions
Additional questions specific to the requisition
We may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests or psychometrics.
If we offer you a position, we have a legitimate interest to collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers and information from employment background check providers where necessary. We will also require a drug test if you accept a position in North America. We will seek information from third parties only at the point a job offer has been made to you and we will confirm that we are doing so.
Why do we process personal data?
We use your personal information to determine your eligibility for specific career positions, for related positions, to notify you of future job openings and hiring events, and to communicate with you through the hiring process. We only collect and use this information based on your consent. That consent may be withdrawn at any time.
We may need your personal data to ensure compliance with our legal obligations. For example, we may be required to check a successful applicant’s eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.
We have a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows us to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate’s suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. We may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.
We may process information about whether applicants are disabled to make reasonable adjustments for candidates who have a disability. This is to carry out our obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.
If you accept a position with us, we will perform a background check that includes seeking information on criminal convictions and offences. In North America, we also perform drug testing. We have a legitimate interest in using this information to comply with contracts with our customers and for confirming your suitability to the position.
We will not use your data for any purpose other than the recruitment exercise for which you have applied. Individuals must opt-in prior to their personal information being processed for a different purpose.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as a reason for processing your data, we considered whether those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of you and other workers and have concluded that they are not.
Who has access to your data?
Your information may be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.

We only use third-parties who will process strictly according to our instructions and in a manner that secures the confidentiality, integrity and availability your personal data. We are responsible for any data that is transferred to third parties.
