4. Legal basis and purpose of processing personal data
Customer data filing system for the travel card system
The data is used for managing the customer relationship between
competent authority (TVV)
public transport and the customer, and to implement the service. The
customer’s
identification data is used to verify their right to buy a personal
travel card and to validate
the accuracy of their personal use of services.
The customer’s identification number is used for the purpose of
identifying the customer
reliably and accurately in the filing system to ensure that the rights
and obligations
of the customer and TVV are put into effect:
·
when delivering a personal travel card, which involves
verifying and establishing the customer’s right to buy it.
·
when verifying the customer’s home municipality.
-
Delivering a personal subsidized travel card requires
that the customer lives in a municipality belonging to the TVV region.
-
The customer’s place of domicile may have to be
checked during the contractual relationship, as their home municipality may
change while the card is in force. The customer is obliged to update the
information on the change of home municipality on their travel card after this
data has been updated in the Population Register Centre’s Population
Information System.
-
The discount on the payment basis varies by
municipality.
-
The home municipality of a customer is checked using
the Population Register Centre’s Population Information System.
·
when deactivating a travel card that has gone missing
and establishing how many journeys remain on the card.
·
when replacing a damaged travel card and establishing
how many journeys remain on the card.
·
when identifying the owner of a travel card which has
been found.
·
when identifying the customer for the purpose of
refunding a ticket product on their travel card or resolving an error.
·
when checking loading events and display events, if
any, on the customer’s travel card.
·
when retrieving the data on the personal travel card
and importing it into the online service application at the customer’s request.
The retrieval of card information requires strong digital authentication of the
customer by means of online bank access codes.
·
when
closing down
the travel
card at the end of the customer relationship.
·
when the customer authenticates themselves when the
customer relationship is terminated.
Customer data filing system for the online and mobile
services
The data is used to produce and implement the service (products
downloaded onto a travel
card or a ticket identifier) and in communications relating to the
management of the
customer relationship. The customer’s identification data is used to
verify the accuracy of
their use of services.
The customer’s identification number is used for the purpose of
identifying the customer
reliably and accurately in the filing system
in order
to
ensure that the rights and obligations
of the customer, the controller and the public transport authorities are
put into effect:
·
when checking loading events and display events, if
any, on the customer’s travel card/ticket identifier.
·
when retrieving the data on the personal travel
card/ticket identifier and importing it into the online service application at
the customer’s request. The retrieval of card/ticket identifier information
requires strong digital authentication of the customer by means of online bank
access codes.
·
when the customer authenticates themselves when the
customer relationship is terminated.
Other use: The data in the customer data filing system
may be used for direct marketing if
the customer has given their explicit consent for this.
Personal data is processed primarily for the purpose of implementing the
agreement and
the legitimate interests of TVV, the controller and any third parties.
Processing may also be
necessary to comply with the statutory obligations binding the
controller and/or to
exercise the official authority belonging to the authorities using the
filing system.
The data may also be used for planning, developing and compiling
statistics of the
controller’s activities.

Monitoring of use and access
The use of the filing system in accordance with the user’s duties, as
well as attempts to access the filing system, are monitored using a file
concerning the monitoring of access. The information required for monitoring is
stored both in a database and a file-format log. The subsystems of the service
create the log in accordance with the control parameters. Log files are stored
in a file system with restricted access rights (read-only or write access)
provided only to persons in charge of maintaining the service. In general, log
files are stored for a period of nine (9) months.
Particular information
about the use of the filing systems is stored in the database for the
purpose of access control (user ID, time stamp, search criteria and reason).
The data stored in the database allows us to monitor and report on the
appropriate use of the customer data filing systems. Reports needed for the
monitoring of use and access are produced from this data. The file-format log
is used for storing the searches and changes made in the customer information
according to user and date, as well as the identifying information of the user
making the search. In general, log files are stored for a period of nine (9)
months.
Technical maintenance
The system providers ensure that the customer data filing system remains
technically intact.
Technical information concerning the system is needed for maintaining
and securing the technical availability and integrity of the system.
Transactions produced by the device are stored as technical data. No personal
data is collected or stored as technical data.
Ensuring availability
The data is protected against intentional and unintentional destruction
(by, for example, keeping the central units in locked premises protected with
passage control systems and keeping backup copies of the files in a separate
fire compartment), and the integrity of data is ensured by means of technical
maintenance data and transaction data. The internal data communications of the
system are implemented by means of closed networks. External connections have
firewall protection. The system and its data communications are monitored 24/7.
