/
Development of simple segmentations:
So that LALIGA can send you segmented commercial communications via email or other instant messaging channels, about LALIGA products and services. These communications will be made based on the information you have provided us through the registration form or through your
MyAccount
profile (for example, we will send you communications about products that may be of interest to you based on your age, favorite team or your province of residence).
The information used for the development of segments will be only that declared by the interested party in any of the assets that make up LALIGA Ecosystem (for example, gender, country, city, age and favorite team or sport), with a low level of detail on the user profile without using information inferred from the interested party or from third party sources, being, in any case, segmentations little exhaustive. In this way, commercial communications can be sent according to the simple segments created with the aforementioned information, avoiding sending content that has no relation to you.
In this regard, we inform you that LALIGA uses consulting and technical support providers to carry out simple segmentations of users.
The legal basis for the aforementioned purpose is that the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest of LALIGA under the provisions of art. 6.1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, consisting of making effective use of the personal data provided by the user to achieve greater interest and return of the communications sent. Before doing so, we inform you that LALIGA has carried out an analysis of proportionality between its legitimate interest and the rights and freedoms of its users, whose conclusions you can request through
lopd@laliga.es
You have the right to object to the aforementioned purpose at any time in accordance with the procedure described in the section
"What are your rights when you provide us with your personal data?".
Under no circumstances will profiling carried out by
LALIGA
produce legal effects or significantly affect you in any similar way
/
Elaboration of exhaustive profiles:
If you give us your permission, LALIGA will elaborate an exhaustive profile of you to improve its commercial campaigns, offering you
personalized advertising, information, services and products
through the sending of personalized commercial communications via email or other instant messaging channels, sending you personalized push or in-app notifications (provided that you have given your consent for the purpose
"LALIGA commercial communications"
) or showing you banners with personalized advertising on websites, applications or social networks about LALIGA products and services (for example, if we identify that you are a fan of a particular club, we will offer you personalized incentives, such as a jersey of your favorite team).
Thus, the aforementioned information will be directed to the segments (groupings of users that are made based on the information obtained from them or the use you make of the APP or other assets of LALIGA Ecosystem) that we can develop based on the following data sources:
The information you provide directly in the registration process or through your
MyAccount
profile (in this case, country, language, favorite team);
The social login (in this case, first and last name, email address, birthday, gender, city and province in which you reside, the interest categories, as well as those inferred values
-engagement, social, promotion and fan value-
obtained from the posts in your Facebook biography and the likes on the page);
Interactions with communications or notifications you receive (e.g., clicking on the content of a communication);
Data inferred as a result of usage and activity on the Platform (device ID, registered user ID, device model, operating system and telemetry, e.g., clicking on particular content or time spent on the asset).
In
addition, LALIGA will generate these segments taking into account the following profiling techniques:
Measurement of individual campaign performance: LALIGA will use the information related to opening rates, average click-through rates, email bounces or unsubscribe rates to measure campaign performance at an individual level, and as a consequence, perform segmentations based on the information inferred about you and the other information declared, in order to impact you again with certain campaigns that are more related to you or include you only in those in which you have shown more interest (for example, if you are a very active user in certain communications we may send you communications of the same type more frequently). To this end, we inform you that through the data management tools provided by the social networks in which LALIGA has an account, user audiences will be created that can be shared, within each social network and in encrypted form, with third parties outside LALIGA, in order to create their advertising campaigns within the social network itself.
Campaign optimization: we will exclude you from those advertising campaigns about sweepstakes in which you have participated, about applications in which you have registered or downloaded, about products you have purchased or about services you have previously purchased (for example, we will avoid offering you a LALIGA app if we know that you have previously downloaded it). To do so, we will cross-reference your information with information obtained from other LALIGA assets of which you are a user.
Users similar to your tastes and preferences: thanks to the profile that LALIGA makes about you, we can send you personalized content taking into account other profiles similar to yours (for example, if we identify that other users similar to you like eSports, we will show you advertising related to eSports).
Valuation of users: LALIGA will obtain an unknown variable from known variables provided or inferred from you so that it can carry out an analysis of its users in order to identify those with a higher propensity to use or contract LALIGA products, and where appropriate, offer you LALIGA products and services.
Retargeting: in the event that you have interacted with LALIGA without having registered or without having used or downloaded the corresponding LALIGA asset , LALIGA may use the identifying data of your device and/or your email to impact you with advertising in other non-LALIGA environments in order to achieve the interaction desired by LALIGA.
The legal basis for the processing of your data for the above-mentioned purpose
is the consent you have given us
to process your data for the specific purposes selected in accordance with the provisions of art. 6.1 a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. Your personal data will be kept for this purpose until you revoke your consent.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time in accordance with the procedure described in the section
"What are your rights when you provide us with your personal data?",
without affecting the lawfulness of the consent-based processing prior to its withdrawal.
In this regard, we inform you that LALIGA uses consulting and technical support providers to carry out complex profiling.
Under no circumstances will profiling carried out by
LALIGA
produce legal effects or significantly affect you in any similar way

which uses, in turn, the services of a provider located in the United States (Neverbounce, Inc.), which involves the international transfer of your email to the United States, in order to verify the validity of your email. This country does not guarantee a level of protection equivalent to that of the European Economic Area. For this reason, standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission have been signed with this service provider pursuant to art. 46.2 c) of the General Data Protection Regulation, including additional guarantees and obligations addressed to these providers for the greatest possible security and transparency. The content of the standard contractual clauses is available upon request at

/

Additional Purposes
Below are the additional purposes for which LALIGA will process your personal data:
/
LALIGA commercial communications:
So that LALIGA can send you commercial communications via email or other instant messaging channels (e.g. SMS) about its activities (the competitions it organizes, campaigns, public viewings, shows or live events), products (applications, web platforms and games developed by LALIGA), services, LALIGA's own contests, offers, sweepstakes and/or promotions, or contests, offers, sweepstakes and/or promotions carried out by LALIGA on products and services promoted jointly by LALIGA with its official sponsors, which you can consult
here
, national federations or national and international television channels
.
For this purpose, LALIGA will only process your e-mail address and, where appropriate, your telephone number.
We also inform you that, in order to send you commercial communications via email or SMS, LALIGA uses a service of a third party provider (salesforce.com EMEA Limited)
which involves the international transfer of the email address you have provided to the United States, a country that guarantees a level of protection equivalent to that of the European Union for personal data transferred from Europe to third party providers in the United States that are adhered to the Data Privacy Framework, including this provider.
Finally, LALIGA also uses the consulting and technical support services of other providers to send commercial communications.
The legal basis for the processing of your data for the above-mentioned purpose
is the consent you have given us
to process your data for the specific purposes selected in accordance with the provisions of art. 6.1 a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. Your personal data will be kept for this purpose until you revoke your consent.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time in accordance with the procedure described in the section
"
What are your rights when you provide us with your personal data?
",
without affecting the lawfulness of the consent-based processing prior to its withdrawal.
/
Development of simple segmentations:
So that LALIGA can send you segmented commercial communications via email or other instant messaging channels, about LALIGA's products and services. These communications will be made based on the information you have provided us through the registration form or through your
MyAccount
profile (for example, we will send you communications about products that may be of interest to you based on your age, favorite team or your province of residence).
The information used for the elaboration of segments will be only that declared by the interested party in any of the assets that make up LALIGA Ecosystem (for example, gender, country, city, age and favorite team or sport), with a low level of detail on the user's profile without using information inferred from the interested party or from third party sources, being, in any case, segmentations not very exhaustive. In this way, commercial communications can be sent according to the simple segments created with the aforementioned information, avoiding sending content that has no relation to you.
In this regard, we inform you that LALIGA uses consulting and technical support providers to carry out simple segmentations of users.
The legal basis for the aforementioned purpose is that the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest of LALIGA under the provisions of art. 6.1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, consisting of making effective use of the personal data provided by the user to achieve greater interest and return of the communications sent. Before doing so, we inform you that LALIGA has carried out an analysis of proportionality between its legitimate interest and the rights and freedoms of its users, whose conclusions you can request through
lopd@laliga.es
You have the right to object to the aforementioned purpose at any time in accordance with the procedure described in the section
"What are your rights when you provide us with your personal data?".
In no case will the elaboration of segments made by
LALIGA
produce legal effects or significantly affect you in any similar way.
/
Elaboration of exhaustive profiles
: If you give us your permission, LALIGA will create a comprehensive profile of you so that it can offer you
personalized experiences, information and products
by sending you personalized commercial communications via email, SMS, or other instant messaging channels (provided that you have granted consent for the purpose
"LALIGA commercial communications"
) or show you banners with personalized advertising on websites, apps or social networks about LALIGA products and services (for example, if we identify that you are a fan of a particular club, we will offer you personalized incentives, such as a jersey of your favorite team).
Thus, the aforementioned information will be directed to the segments (groupings of users that are made based on the information obtained from them or the use you make of the Web or other assets of LALIGA Ecosystem) that we can develop based on the following data sources
●
The information you provide during registration or through your
MyAccount
profile (in this case, favorite team, country or language)
●
The social login (in this case, first and last name, email address, birthday, gender, city and province in which you reside, the interest categories, as well as those inferred values
-engagement, social, promotion and fan value-
obtained from the posts in your Facebook biography and the likes on the page);
●
Interactions with communications or notifications you receive (e.g., clicking on the content of a communication)
●
Data inferred as a result of usage and activity on the Platform (device ID, registered user ID, device model, operating system and telemetry, e.g., clicking on particular content or time spent on the asset)
In addition, LALIGA will generate these segments taking into account the following profiling techniques
●
Measurement of individual campaign performance: LALIGA will use the information related to opening rates, average click-through rates, email bounces or unsubscribe rates to measure campaign performance at an individual level, and as a consequence, perform segmentations based on the information inferred about you and the other information declared, in order to impact you again with certain campaigns that are more related to you or include you only in those in which you have shown more interest (for example, if you are a very active user in certain communications we may send you communications of the same type more frequently). To this end, we inform you that through the data management tools provided by the social networks in which LALIGA has an account, user audiences will be created that can be shared, within each social network and in encrypted form, with third parties outside LALIGA, in order to create their advertising campaigns within the social network itself.
●
Campaign optimization: we will exclude you from those advertising campaigns about sweepstakes in which you have participated, about applications in which you have registered or downloaded, about products you have purchased or about services you have previously purchased (for example, we will avoid offering you a LALIGA app if we know that you have previously downloaded it). To do so, we will cross-reference your information with information obtained from other LALIGA assets of which you are a user.
●
Users similar to your tastes and preferences: thanks to the profile that LALIGA makes about you, we can send you personalized content taking into account other profiles similar to yours (for example, if we identify that other users similar to you like eSports, we will show you advertising related to eSports)
●
Valuation of users: LALIGA will obtain an unknown variable from known variables provided or inferred from you so that it can carry out an analysis of its users in order to identify those with a higher propensity to use or contract LALIGA products, and where appropriate, offer you LALIGA products and services
●
Retargeting: in the event that you have interacted with LALIGA without having registered or without having used or downloaded the corresponding LALIGA asset, LALIGA may use the identifying data of your device and/or your email to impact you with advertising in other environments outside LALIGA in order to achieve the interaction desired by LALIGA.
In this regard, we inform you that LALIGA uses consulting and technical support providers to carry out complex profiling.
Under no circumstances will profiling carried out by
LALIGA
produce legal effects or significantly affect you in any similar way.

ACTIVE PURSUIT OF PIRACY
In order to pursue the various actions of audiovisual piracy that are related to LALIGA's audiovisual content, LALIGA has tools that allow the prevention and active prosecution of these behaviors. The use of these tools may involve the processing of personal data of alleged infringers of intellectual property rights over which LALIGA holds the exploitation rights.
Likewise, LALIGA, in certain circumstances, may take legal action against those interested parties who are presumed to have engaged in infringing conduct.
Who is responsible for the processing of personal data?
The personal data will be processed by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional, (hereinafter, "LALIGA") with NIF: G-78069762 and address at Calle Torrelaguna 60, 28043, Madrid.
Contact LALIGA's Data Protection Officer:
dpo@laliga.es
Where do we obtain personal data?
LALIGA will process the data obtained through the use of the various tools at its disposal:
/
User name in different applications,
/
Pseudonymized data (unique identifiers associated with each user name),
/
IP addresses (including, in certain cases, domestic IP addresses),
/
E-mail address, name and surname, telephone number and advertising identifiers relating to legal entities or natural persons acting in their capacity as individual entrepreneurs.
As well as other data that may be sent by the various Internet access operators to LALIGA relating to legal entities or individuals acting in their capacity as individual entrepreneurs (IP addresses, name and surname, postal address and identification document such as NIF or NIE).
For what purposes do we process personal data?
/
Active pursuit of audiovisual piracy:
We inform you that personal data (in this case, the data that have been collected by the various applications available to LALIGA) will be processed by LALIGA for the purpose of conducting investigations for the purpose of prosecution of acts of audiovisual piracy on LALIGA content.
/
Filing of legal actions against alleged infringers:
We inform you that the personal data (in this case, the data that have been communicated by the various Internet access operators) will be processed by LALIGA for the purpose of bringing the corresponding legal actions against those infringers on whom there is reasonable evidence that they are making available or disseminating, either directly or indirectly, content, works or services subject to intellectual property rights without meeting the requirements established by law and through acts that cannot be considered carried out by end consumers in good faith and without the intention of obtaining economic and/or commercial benefits.
In this regard, we inform you that LALIGA uses technical suppliers, with whom LALIGA has formalized a contract for the processing, to carry out the purposes described above.
The legal basis for the aforementioned purposes is that the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest of LALIGA under the provisions of art. 6.1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, consisting of protecting LALIGA's audiovisual content to prevent its commercialization from being affected by the unlawful practice of piracy.
Before doing so, we inform you that LALIGA has carried out an analysis of proportionality between its legitimate interest and the rights and freedoms of its users. You can request the conclusions of this analysis through .
lopd@laliga.es
With respect to these purposes, there is no right of opposition to the processing of personal data by the data subject, all this, under Article 21.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, since, on the one hand, compelling legitimate grounds for the processing of such data that prevail over the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject can be accredited and, on the other hand, the processing of data is necessary for the formulation and exercise of claims that, where appropriate, are relevant.
How long will we keep the personal data?
The personal data we process will be kept for as long as the purposes for which they were collected or the rights of deletion, opposition or limitation of processing are not exercised.
In this sense, once the above term has expired, LALIGA will keep the personal data duly blocked for the sole purpose of meeting any liability of any kind that may arise:

Active prosecution of audiovisual piracy:
the data used for the active prosecution of audiovisual piracy will be kept as long as this purpose persists, and once it has been fulfilled, during the period of limitation of the legal actions that may arise from it.

Legal action against alleged offenders
: data received from operators will be retained for a maximum of 30 calendar days. If it is decided not to take legal action, the data will be destroyed immediately. If, on the other hand, it is decided to take legal action, the data will be retained for the duration of the proceedings and, at the end of the proceedings, for the statute of limitations period of the corresponding legal proceedings.
Personal data will be definitively deleted when these deadlines expire.
