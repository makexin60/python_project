Privacy Policy
Neo Fertility App Ltd., (together with its parents,
            subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees,
            officers, and directors - collectively, "Chart Neo", the
            “Company”, "we" or "us") provides services
            ("Services", collectively) that help couples track their fertility
            cycles. Our main services are electronic applications (the "App") for
            fertility tracking. We are an Irish Corporation based in Dublin, Ireland. The
            purpose of this privacy policy (the “Policy”) is to inform you of the Company’s
            privacy practices and policies, including how and why Company collects your
            personal information, how it intends to use your personal information and to
            provide you with contact information should you have questions or concerns
            about the Company’s privacy practices.
Company reserves the right to update and change this
            Policy from time to time by posting the updated Policy at
https://www.chartneo.com/privacy
and on the
            App. It is your responsibility to consult with this Policy from time to time to
            ensure that you are up to date on any changes which may affect you.
1.
Personal information collected by Company
In order for you to create an account on NeoFertility
            and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
            Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
Information you provide by completing forms on
            Chart Neo - your e-mail address, telephone number, login, and password
            details. We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the
            Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through
            Chart Neo, or if you contact us.
2.
Details of any requests or transaction you
                make through the App and/or Services
Information about your activity on and interaction
            with Chart Neo and the App (such as your IP address, the type of device or
            browser you use, and your actions on the App and other services) may be logged
            for internal troubleshooting/diagnostic purposes, improving App experience,
            maintaining the security of your account, and to prevent fraud and abuse. We
            may also log this information in order to be compliant with government laws and
            regulations where appropriate. Any other use or sharing of your data requires
            an explicit opt-in from you. We will NEVER share your data with a 3rd party
            without your express consent, unless required by a government authority with
            the appropriate jurisdiction.
3.
European Union Users
Data protection law in Europe requires a "lawful
            basis" for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or
            residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include: Performing
            the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal
            data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services. Legal
            compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For
            example, tax laws require us to retain records of payments made through our
            Services. Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law
            which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we
            do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require
            your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be
            expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact
            your rights, freedom or interests. For example, we use identity, device, and
            location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services
            secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our Services,
            subject to your right to control whether we do so. We analyze how users
            interact with our App so we can understand better what elements of the design
            are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve
            and develop the quality of the experience we offer all our users.
4.
How This Information Is Shared
When you create an account, all of your information is
            kept private. There are features within the App and Services to share your data
            with other users; however, you must explicitly choose whom you wish to share
            your data with.
We do not and will not sell your data.
5.
Information sharing for research
From time to time, we may partner with non-profit
            entities that conduct studies to help improve fertility outcomes. To share your
            data with these entities, you must explicitly OPT-IN to the sharing. Before
            your data leaves our jurisdiction, it is anonymized so that it cannot be
            identified as you. We provide several options as to the level of sharing that
            you wish to allow.
6.
Information that's shared to protect
                Chart Neo and comply with the law
We do reserve the right to disclose personal
            information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply
            with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect
            Chart Neo's legal rights, property, or the safety of Chart Neo, its
            employees, users, or others.
7.
Links to Other Websites and Services
Our App or Services may include links to other
            websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from Chart Neo's.
            When you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data
            processing disclosures for that site or service governs.
8.
Retention
We will retain your information as long as your
            account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as
            otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also retain and use this
            information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the
            extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
            enforce our agreements and protect Chart Neo's legal rights.
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or
            pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the
            safety and security of our App or Services, improve our Services, or comply
            with legal obligations.
9.
Your Rights
Users residing in certain countries, including the EU,
            are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where
            an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access,
            correct, and request deletion of your personal information. While these rights
            are not applicable globally, all Chart Neo users can manage their personal
            information, as further described below, in their account settings. You can
            request a downloadable copy of your personal data from Chart Neo from your
            account settings page. To modify or delete the personal information you've
            provided to us, please log in and update your information. You may also delete
            your account from your account settings page. We may retain certain information
            as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
10.
Email and Mobile Notifications
We want to communicate with you only if you want to
            hear from us. We try to keep e-mails to a minimum and give you the ability to
            opt in to any marketing communications we send. We will send you e-mail
            relating to your transactions on Chart Neo. You may also elect to receive
            certain marketing e-mail communications, in accordance with your preferences,
            and from which you may opt out at any time by adjusting your notifications
            settings. On the App, you can manage the notifications you receive on your
            mobile device in your profile settings. We'll also send you service-related
            announcements when it's necessary to do so.
11.
Security
We take security seriously, and the security of your
            personal data is important to us. We follow industry-standard practices to
            protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the Internet. No
            method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely
            secure, so Chart Neo cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your account
            information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and
            keep secure.
We have a protocol in place in the event of a data
            breach. We encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities of our
            Services by e-mailing dpo@chartneo.com.

Privacy Policy
Neo Fertility App Ltd., (together with its parents,
            subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees,
            officers, and directors - collectively, "Chart Neo", the
            “Company”, "we" or "us") provides services
            ("Services", collectively) that help couples track their fertility
            cycles. Our main services are electronic applications (the "App") for
            fertility tracking. We are an Irish Corporation based in Dublin, Ireland. The
            purpose of this privacy policy (the “Policy”) is to inform you of the Company’s
            privacy practices and policies, including how and why Company collects your
            personal information, how it intends to use your personal information and to
            provide you with contact information should you have questions or concerns
            about the Company’s privacy practices.
Company reserves the right to update and change this
            Policy from time to time by posting the updated Policy at
https://www.chartneo.com/privacy
and on the
            App. It is your responsibility to consult with this Policy from time to time to
            ensure that you are up to date on any changes which may affect you.
1.
Personal information collected by Company
In order for you to create an account on NeoFertility
            and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
            Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
Information you provide by completing forms on
            Chart Neo - your e-mail address, telephone number, login, and password
            details. We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the
            Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through
            Chart Neo, or if you contact us.
2.
Details of any requests or transaction you
                make through the App and/or Services
Information about your activity on and interaction
            with Chart Neo and the App (such as your IP address, the type of device or
            browser you use, and your actions on the App and other services) may be logged
            for internal troubleshooting/diagnostic purposes, improving App experience,
            maintaining the security of your account, and to prevent fraud and abuse. We
            may also log this information in order to be compliant with government laws and
            regulations where appropriate. Any other use or sharing of your data requires
            an explicit opt-in from you. We will NEVER share your data with a 3rd party
            without your express consent, unless required by a government authority with
            the appropriate jurisdiction.
3.
European Union Users
Data protection law in Europe requires a "lawful
            basis" for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or
            residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include: Performing
            the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal
            data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services. Legal
            compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For
            example, tax laws require us to retain records of payments made through our
            Services. Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law
            which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we
            do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require
            your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be
            expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact
            your rights, freedom or interests. For example, we use identity, device, and
            location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services
            secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our Services,
            subject to your right to control whether we do so. We analyze how users
            interact with our App so we can understand better what elements of the design
            are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve
            and develop the quality of the experience we offer all our users.
4.
How This Information Is Shared
When you create an account, all of your information is
            kept private. There are features within the App and Services to share your data
            with other users; however, you must explicitly choose whom you wish to share
            your data with.
We do not and will not sell your data.
5.
Information sharing for research
From time to time, we may partner with non-profit
            entities that conduct studies to help improve fertility outcomes. To share your
            data with these entities, you must explicitly OPT-IN to the sharing. Before
            your data leaves our jurisdiction, it is anonymized so that it cannot be
            identified as you. We provide several options as to the level of sharing that
            you wish to allow.
6.
Information that's shared to protect
                Chart Neo and comply with the law
We do reserve the right to disclose personal
            information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply
            with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect
            Chart Neo's legal rights, property, or the safety of Chart Neo, its
            employees, users, or others.
7.
Links to Other Websites and Services
Our App or Services may include links to other
            websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from Chart Neo's.
            When you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data
            processing disclosures for that site or service governs.
8.
Retention
We will retain your information as long as your
            account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as
            otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also retain and use this
            information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the
            extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
            enforce our agreements and protect Chart Neo's legal rights.
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or
            pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the
            safety and security of our App or Services, improve our Services, or comply
            with legal obligations.
9.
Your Rights
Users residing in certain countries, including the EU,
            are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where
            an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access,
            correct, and request deletion of your personal information. While these rights
            are not applicable globally, all Chart Neo users can manage their personal
            information, as further described below, in their account settings. You can
            request a downloadable copy of your personal data from Chart Neo from your
            account settings page. To modify or delete the personal information you've
            provided to us, please log in and update your information. You may also delete
            your account from your account settings page. We may retain certain information
            as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
10.
Email and Mobile Notifications
We want to communicate with you only if you want to
            hear from us. We try to keep e-mails to a minimum and give you the ability to
            opt in to any marketing communications we send. We will send you e-mail
            relating to your transactions on Chart Neo. You may also elect to receive
            certain marketing e-mail communications, in accordance with your preferences,
            and from which you may opt out at any time by adjusting your notifications
            settings. On the App, you can manage the notifications you receive on your
            mobile device in your profile settings. We'll also send you service-related
            announcements when it's necessary to do so.
11.
Security
We take security seriously, and the security of your
            personal data is important to us. We follow industry-standard practices to
            protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the Internet. No
            method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely
            secure, so Chart Neo cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your account
            information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and
            keep secure.
We have a protocol in place in the event of a data
            breach. We encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities of our
            Services by e-mailing dpo@chartneo.com.
