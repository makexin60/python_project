Phishing and spam
Spam is unsolicited bulk junk emails which use up valuable space and time.
Phishing emails are potentially harmful exposing our system to viruses and other damaging applications. Department staff are requested to delete these messages.
Here are some suggestions on recognising and managing spam and phishing emails:
If you don't recognise the sender or the subject looks suspicious, delete the message without opening it.
Never open attachments links in messages from strangers, or even suspicious-looking messages from people that you know.
Never reply to spam messages or attempt to contact the sender.
Be careful who you give your email address to.
Never confirm details like account numbers or passwords.
If you believe the email may be genuine, contact the institution by phone and confirm its validity.
If department staff receive suspect emails from a particular address, forward a copy to
abuse@det.nsw.edu.au
to help improve filtering.
Policy updates over time

The department collects a significant volume of personal information, including health information, while administering and providing education, training and community services. It takes reasonable steps to maintain confidentiality and comply with privacy legislation.
When handling personal and health information, the department complies with information protection and health privacy principles to minimise the risk of misuse and support individual privacy.
Personal information is any information or opinion that can be used to identify a person. It could be a person’s name, address, family details, fingerprints or a mix of information that together could identify someone. This information can be recorded in paper files, electronic records, video recordings and photographs.
Health information is a type of personal information that relates to a person’s physical or mental health, or the healthcare they receive. It could be information about a person’s allergies or medication, or details relating to a person’s injury at work or school.
Health information includes:
information or opinions about someone’s physical or mental health or disability at any time
a person’s express request for future
health services
External link
information about health services provided (or to be provided) to someone
other
personal information

personal information gathered in relation to the donation, or planned donation, of body parts, organs or body substances
genetic information obtained from a health service, which could predict the health of an individual or their relatives
healthcare identifiers.
Information Protection Principles (IPPs) and Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) support the privacy of individuals by minimising the risk of misuse of personal and health information.
There are 12 IPPs and 15 HPPs, which are similar in many respects and address the collection, storage, access, alteration, use and disclosure of personal and health information. In addition, HPPs cover identifiers, anonymity and linkage to health records.
Refer to the Information and Privacy Commission NSW IPPs and HPPs factsheets located on the following websites:
Information Protection Principles for the public
External link
Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) explained for members of the public
External link
.
Exemptions
Privacy legislation provides for a number of exemptions to the IPPs and HPPs, for example, where the information is the subject of a subpoena or police warrant.
The department also recognises that in certain circumstances, requirements of the IPPs and HPPs do not apply. For example:
when non-compliance is lawfully authorised, required, implied or reasonably contemplated under an Act or law
when investigating or handling a complaint that could be, or has been, referred to or from an investigative agency, such as the Ombudsman’s Office
when undertaking an investigation under legislation that may result in the agency taking disciplinary, criminal or formal action against a person.
The department’s
Privacy Code of Practice (PDF 361 KB)
provides further information on the modifications of the IPPs, and where exemptions apply.
The Privacy Commissioner has also published 7 statutory guidelines that provide guidance on applying for exemptions. Refer to
Privacy Resources for Agencies
External link
.
1. Collect and store information
The department takes steps to ensure that the people whose information it collects understand:
why the information is required
who will see it
how they can access and amend it.
The department usually does this by issuing a collection notice when it collects the information.
Generally, physical information storage systems such as filing cabinets should be locked when unattended.
Personal information stored on electronic files should be password protected and access limited to those staff whose duties require it.
Back-ups of electronic files should be made and stored securely.
Where practicable, personal information in an electronic form should be encrypted before it is stored or shared.

2. Respond to access requests
When responding to a request for access to personal information, it is important to identify the purpose of the access, with procedures established to authorise access according to the:
nature of the information
type of storage
appropriate level of security.
Individuals may request access to their personal information by either:

2.1 Informal release of information
The department encourages the informal release of information where it is appropriate and manageable and follows the
Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009
External link
(GIPA).
Department staff with the appropriate delegation can use the
Informal release checklist for business units – GIPA Act (PDF 159 KB)
to assess whether a request for release of government information is suitable.
The
Informal release of government information under GIPA Act – Summary for business areas (PDF 281 KB)

For information on the various methods of information release under the GIPA, and how they impact schools and other corporate business areas, refer to the fact sheet,
How does the GIPA Act affect the department’s business areas (PDF 143 KB)
.
3. Request an amendment
Individuals have the right to determine whether the department can hold, access and modify their personal information, except where the information is subject to workers compensation claims or injury management.
Individuals may request to amend their personal information held by the department.
If the department is not prepared to make an amendment, individuals may request that a statement reflecting their requested changes be attached to the information.
If an individual lacks the capacity to understand the nature and effect of the Privacy legislation or is unable to communicate their intentions, a request may be made on the individual’s behalf by:
an authorised representative
parent
carer
legal guardian or a person legally authorised to represent the best interests of the individual.
The
Change of personal information procedures
outlines how employees can amend their personal and health information held by the department.
For information that is not accessible online, employees can make an informal request for amendments directly to the business unit responsible for holding the information.
If an informal request is denied, employees can make a formal request in writing by using the department’s
Application for Amendment (PDF 107 KB
) form or the Application for amendment form in Annexure 2 of the
Privacy Management Plan for NSW Department of Education (PDF 643 KB

the findings of the review and reasons for the findings as well as an explanation of the law behind those findings
the action proposed to be taken by the department and the reasons for that action
the applicant’s right to have the subject of the complaint reviewed by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal.
The determining officer will:

Following the completion of an internal review, the department may:
take no further action on the matter
inform the applicant of the corrective action plan in place to ensure the incident does not occur again
make a formal apology to the applicant
take such remedial action as it thinks appropriate (such as the payment of monetary compensation to the applicant)

5.4 Department complaints procedures
Concerns about the collection, storage, access, use or disclosure of personal or health information – other than those managed through the internal review, external review (sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3) or misconduct investigation processes (section 5.5) – are managed through the department’s complaint handling procedures.
Refer to:
Community complaint procedures
for guidance on managing complaints by parents, carers, students and community members
Staff complaint procedures (staff only)
for guidance on managing complaints by employees.
5.5 Misconduct investigation
Breaches of privacy by an employee that are deliberate and more than trivial may amount to misconduct.
The department’s
Code of ethics and conduct policy document
requires employees to report allegations of misconduct to Professional and Ethical Standards (PES). It may be appropriate for business areas in the department to make a report on behalf of an individual, including following an application for internal review.
Individuals can also make a report directly to PES at
pes@det.nsw.edu.au
or on 7814 3722.
The
Public Interest Disclosures Act 2022
(the PID Act) defines a more than trivial breach of the PPIPA or HRIPA as serious wrongdoing. Employees who make reports may be entitled to protections under the PID Act if their report meets certain requirements. The features of a public interest disclosure are detailed further in the department’s
Public interest disclosures procedures
.
Under the PID Act, all employees have a responsibility to assist an investigation into a privacy breach, if requested.
For additional information on conduct that may require a referral to PES, refer to:

Privacy legislation
The NSW privacy legislation - the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 and the Health Records and Information Act 2002 - imposes specific obligations on the department when handling personal and health information that directly or indirectly identifies a person. These obligations, expressed in
12 Information Protection Principles
External link
and
15 Health Privacy Principles
External link
, relate to the collection, storage, use, disclosure and alteration of and access to personal and health information.
Modifications to the legislation
Privacy legislation allows for modification of these principles by way of codes of practice, public interest directions and statutory guidelines and regulations. The department's
Privacy Code of Practice
modifies Information Protection Principles as they relate to certain functions of the department. A number of public interest directions made by the Privacy Commissioner also waive or modify the application of these principles to the department. Four statutory guidelines have been developed to explain exceptions to the health privacy principles.
Collection of information
The department collects a significant volume of personal information in the administration and provision of its education, training and community services. The main classes of information collected are employee, student and other stakeholder information including information about parents and carers and information obtained in the course of developing and managing business relationships.
When collecting personal information the department will take reasonable steps to ensure that the person to whom it relates is made aware of certain matters including the purpose for which it is being collected, the intended recipients of the information and the person's right to access and correct the information. In most instances this will be achieved by a issuing a collection notice in connection with the collection.
Further information about collection of information can be accessed from the
Privacy Management Plan
