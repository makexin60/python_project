you're eligible for our borrowing products;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise through the app; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.

We may share your details with people or companies if we change the structure of our group of companies, merge with another company, or get bought by another company.
How long we keep your information üìÅ
We‚Äôll keep your information for 6 years in case we need to respond to a legal claim. In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to (that‚Äôs in our legitimate interest) and/or the law says we have to.
To work out how long we keep different categories of data, we consider why we hold it, how sensitive it is, how long the law says we need to keep it for, and what the risks are.

Product development and marketing
We:
tell you about products and services through our app or other channels, like social media companies, based on how your use our products and services and other information we hold about you

Automated decisions & Artificial Intelligence
We sometimes make decisions without a human. We do this to decide if:
we can give you a Monzo account based on your age, residency, nationality, financial position and other circumstances, like the results of anti-money laundering and sanctions checks;
we can give you an arranged overdraft, loan, or offer you Monzo Flex based on information we hold about you, and information we get from credit reference agencies. This includes details on whether you've kept up-to-date with payments on any credit accounts, and if you've been to court;
we need to take action, like freezing a transaction or account because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer. We decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work;
you're eligible for our borrowing products;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise through the app; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.
We'll tell you in the app once we've made these decisions. You can ask us to review a decision through in-app chat.
Who we share your data with ü§ù
Here we mean companies that help us provide services you use, and need to process details about you for this reason.
We share as little information as we can and encrypt and/or make it impossible for the recipient to identify you where possible (for example, by using a User ID rather than your name). These are:

analytical, Know Your Customer (KYC) and cyber security service providers that help us with identity verification or fraud checks;
cloud computing power, storage and software providers;
our business intelligence and analytics platform provider;

companies that print written statements and notices; and
companies that manage our CCTV and security if you visit our offices.

verify your identity and make sure what you've told us is true;
help detect and prevent fraud and money laundering;
assess whether you can afford to make repayments if you borrow;

Automated decisions & Artificial Intelligence
We sometimes make decisions without a human. We do this to decide if:
we need to take action, like freezing a transaction or account because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer. We decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work;
we complete initial assessments for disputed transactions you raise; and
our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.
You can ask for a member of the team to review a decision by emailing us at the contact details above.

We also need to compile reports detailing the number and nature of customer contacts received within certain periods of time, which we will use within the business for management purposes. We use reasonable efforts to remove all personal information from these reports, but sometimes (for example, where personal information is contained in the message box of the "
Contact
" page), it may not be practical for this personal information to be removed or anonymised.
We always aim to use your personal information in an ethical and non-intrusive way. We will not use your personal data to target, segment, or profile individuals based on their health, negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, data relating to an alleged or actual commission of a crime, for any unlawful or discriminatory purpose or in any other manner that would be inconsistent with your reasonable expectation of privacy.
How long will we hold your information for?
We will only hold your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
In general, this means we will hold your personal information for as long as you are an active customer of Greggs. While this will vary for each customer, this data will typically cover up to a 10-year period of your activity with us, but may be longer depending on how long you have used our Digital Services.
How we consider you to be an active customer of Greggs:
We consider you an ‚Äòactive‚Äô customer of Greggs, and therefore retained on the database, if within the previous 24 month period you have:
a) Made a digital transaction with us ‚Äì such as placing a click and collect order via the Greggs App, making a purchase on‚ÄØgreggs.com or scanning/using the Greggs App at a Greggs shop; or
b) Received 1 or more stamps, or rewards, in any of the six product categories in the last 24 months; or
c) Had a financial account/wallet balance of any size that has topped up within this period (auto or manual); or
d) Not otherwise already contacted our Customer Care Team to request that your personal information or Greggs Account is removed from our system.
If you cease to be an active customer of Greggs by not engaging in any of the above interactions with us, we will delete your Greggs account and your personal information.
Circumstances where we may retain your personal data:
If you make a complaint we also may need to hold your personal details for a longer period. We may also retain your transaction history for analysis purposes.
In some circumstances you may continue to receive marketing communications from Greggs after your Greggs Account is deleted if you do not opt out.
Notice of deletion
If your contact details are still valid, in most cases we will aim to notify you in advance of our intention to close your Greggs account after 24 months of inactivity, we may, at our discretion, proceed to close your Greggs account sooner if we deem you to no longer be an active customer of Greggs.
Data Retained by our Customer Care Team
In all other cases and where you contact our Customer Care Team we hold your information for 3 years from the date of your contact or if you contact us again within that period of time, for a period of 3 years from the date of your last contact with us. Information held relating to an injury complaint involving a minor will be retained for 3 years following the minor turning 18.
We will hold your personal information for this length of time because:
‚Ä¢ In the case of a Greggs Account it will ensure that your account is kept available for your use for a reasonable period of time before closure;
‚Ä¢ It will help us to handle any Greggs Account queries you may have within this period of time;
‚Ä¢ It will identify any trends in the nature of your contact with us; and
‚Ä¢ It will allow us to investigate a complaint.
After expiry of retention periods your data may be anonymised for market insight purposes and to measure the performance of our business.
We may keep your data for longer if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.
We will from time to time review our retention periods but we will only ever hold your personal information for as long as we believe is necessary for reasons set out above.

Individuals located in UK and the EU and EEA, have certain rights regarding their Personal Data, as set out in more detail below. Some of these rights, e.g., the right to be forgotten or the right to request that we transfer your information to another company, will only apply in certain circumstances. Most rights are also subject to certain exceptions and exemptions that may mean that we are not always legally required to comply with your request in part or in full.
Rights
What does this mean?
The right to be informed
You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your Personal Data and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this notice.
The right of access
You have the right to know how we are using your Personal Data, a right to see a copy of the Personal Data we hold for you and a right to be provided with additional information, for example, about how and why we are using your Personal Data and who it is being shared with. This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your Personal Data in accordance with data protection law.
The right to request that any inaccurate Personal Data is amended
If you think that any of the Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete you have the right to request that we amend it.
The right to erasure
This is also known as ‚Äòthe right to be forgotten‚Äô and, basically, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your Personal Data where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure and we have to comply only where:
We are processing your Personal Data because you gave us consent and this is the legal basis we are relying on for such processing; or
Where, on the basis of our assessment, there is no genuine reason for us to continue processing your Personal Data; and
We have no legal obligation to retain the Personal Data you have requested to be deleted.
The right to restrict processing
You have rights to ‚Äòblock‚Äô or suppress further use of your Personal Data. When processing is restricted, we can still store your Personal information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their Personal Data to be ‚Äòblocked‚Äô to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
The right to data portability
You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to request that this data is transmitted to another controller where this is technically feasible. This right only applies to Personal Data you have provided to us yourself (not any other information), that we process by automated means based on your consent or for the performance of a contract with you.
The right to object
You have the right to object to the use of your Personal Data in some circumstances, such as where we don‚Äôt have to process your Personal Data to meet a contractual or other legal obligation. For example, you may object to the use of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling
You have the right not to have your Personal Data used to make solely automated decisions about you that you impact you. For example, you have the right not to have your Personal Data used to create a profile of you that automated decisions are later based on without there being any human involvement in that processing.
The right to withdraw consent
If you have given your consent to anything we do with your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your Personal Data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). This includes the right to withdraw consent to us using your Personal Data for marketing purposes.
If you would like to exercise or discuss any of these rights, please contact us using the information below.

Modern Slavery statement
This statement, made in accordance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the policies adopted and steps taken by Vue International to:
assess the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our business or supply chain;
prevent any instances of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our own business;and
ensure that every supplier with whom we do business is taking appropriate steps to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking does not occur within their business (or their own supply chain).
In this statement, the terms ‚ÄúVue International‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù refer, respectively, to Vue International Holdings Limited and all of its subsidiaries
.
Our business, structure and supply chain
Vue International is one of the world's leading cinema operators, managing a number of the most respected brands in major European markets, spanning eight countries, 224 sites and 1,962 screens. The Group has leading positions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and Lithuania.
Each of the Group‚Äôs brands is operated as a separate business unit, with local management in each jurisdiction reporting to the Group head office located in London
The Group‚Äôs suppliers include film and other screen content distributors, as well as manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of food, beverages, merchandise, uniforms, technical equipment and providers of cleaning and facilities management services, property maintenance and construction services and other professional services.
Group policy statement
Vue International does not tolerate modern slavery or human trafficking in any aspect of its business, and holds each of its suppliers to the same zero-tolerance standard (regardless of the nature, scale or jurisdiction of their business).
Supplier diligence
Before entering into a relationship with any new supplier, Vue International assesses the modern slavery risks associated with that supplier, the goods or services with respect to which Vue International is proposing to contract with that supplier, and the geographical areas in which that supplier operates. The outcome of this initial analysis determines the level of due diligence which Vue International conducts with respect to that supplier and in relation to those goods or services. In all cases, Vue International will take all reasonable steps:
to confirm that no instance of modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within that supplier‚Äôs business;
to confirm the steps that the supplier has taken to ensure that no modern slavery or human trafficking has occurred (or is occurring) within their own business or supply chain; and
to obtain such further information or evidence from that supplier or other sources as the Group may deem necessary or appropriate regarding that supplier‚Äôs policies and processes in relation to modern slavery or human trafficking.
Vue International‚Äôs approach to supplier diligence is informed by the Group‚Äôs zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking. If the Group is not able to satisfy itself as to the modern slavery and human trafficking policies or procedures of a potential supplier or the modern slavery risks associated with that supplier and its operations, the Group will not conduct any business with that supplier.
While Vue International places significant emphasis on diligence at the point of potential engagement, it also keeps itself appraised of its supply chains as required. Were the Group to discover any evidence, or have cause for suspicion, that any instance of modern slavery or human trafficking had occurred with any of its suppliers, the Group would immediately cease to do business with that supplier pending a full investigation and if appropriate would report the matter to the relevant legal authorities.
Additionally, the Group will always seek to ensure that any supplier contract contains an obligation on the supplier to comply with applicable modern slavery and human trafficking prevention laws and regulations, and to maintain appropriate and robust policies and procedures in that regard.
Supply chain risk analysis
Generally, Vue International considers the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within its or its businesses‚Äô supply chain to be low. The principal reasons for this are that:
the Group‚Äôs key suppliers are large international organisations with robust and sophisticated prevention and compliance policies (overseen by professional compliance teams) in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking; and
many of the Group‚Äôs suppliers operate in industries which receive a relatively high degree of independent regulatory scrutiny (for example, its suppliers in the food and beverage supply and manufacturing industry).
If the Group identifies a supplier (or potential supplier) with higher risk characteristics in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking, they will be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny as part of the procurement process. Characteristics indicating a need for such enhanced scrutiny may include:
the operation of manufacturing or processing facilities by a supplier in countries with less developed protections against worker exploitation, or with higher levels of estimated modern slavery (as determined by the Global Slavery Index 2023); or
a supplier‚Äôs reliance on supply chains with considerable geographic or operational complexity, resulting in challenges for consistent application and monitoring of relevant policies.
The Group also recognises the fact that over the last few years, global supply chains have continued to feel the strain of economic and political instability, international conflict, inflationary pressures and rising raw material prices. These factors put suppliers under pressure which, in turn, increases the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. The Group takes account of that increased risk during its analysis of the materials provided by potential suppliers as part of the diligence process.
Effectiveness of the policies and strategies
At no time since its formation has Vue International encountered, or been the subject of any allegations or complaints of, any occurrence of modern slavery or human trafficking within its business or supply chain.
Whilst this is encouraging, Vue International acknowledges that the Group has a continuing obligation to ensure that its relevant policies and strategies remain fit for purpose as the scale of its business and operations develop over time.
Employee awareness and training
Vue International has adopted a Whistle-Blowing Policy, details of which are available to all employees. This Policy promotes accountability and encourages employees to report concerns about any potential issue affecting the Group, including actual or suspected occurrences of modern slavery or human trafficking. The Policy sets out how employees can raise their concerns, including through the confidential whistle-blowing hotline.
The Group‚Äôs Code of Conduct encourages all employees to raise any concerns or queries they may have in relation to potential misconduct of any kind. The Group continues to consider further ways in which it can increase its employees‚Äô awareness of the specific role they have in preventing slavery and human trafficking, and in helping the Group and its individual businesses to implement policies and processes in that regard.
Continuing development
The Group and its businesses strive to improve and update their policies to reflect the most recent standards of best practice including the policies and processes intended to reduce the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking.
Vue International‚Äôs key initiatives include the following:
standardising the supplier due diligence criteria and process record keeping across all businesses and functions within the Group;
implementing a recurring programme of training and awareness in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking; and
increasing the quality and visibility of the modern slavery and human trafficking information available on the intranet sites for the Group‚Äôs businesses.

In order to provide certain services, we will share your information with third party service providers such as IT infrastructure companies and email logistics providers. We will not share your data with any third party where it is not necessary to do so to provide a service to you.
c)
Regulatory and law enforcement agencies
. As noted above, if we receive a request from a regulatory body or law enforcement agency, and if permitted under GDPR and other laws, we may disclose certain personal information to such bodies or agencies.

Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN)
This privacy notice, produced with Experian and Transunion (the other key CRAs), explains how personal data is processed for core credit referencing activities. This often relates to personal data that has not been collected directly from the individual.

Version: 1.2 - Adopted: 2 December 2024
IN BRIEF
We (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, collectively referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù throughout this Privacy Notice) are credit reference agencies and we play an important role in the UK‚Äôs financial ecosystem. This Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (referred to as ‚Äúthis Privacy Notice‚Äù) explains how we collect, process and share personal data about consumers and businesses (referred to as ‚Äúyou‚Äù).
This section briefly summarises the key processing activities common to all of us. For more detail, please refer to the rest of this document. We recommend reviewing each credit reference agency‚Äôs own privacy notices, which explain the specific processing activities of that credit reference agency. Links to these documents can be found in
Section 14
.
Throughout this Privacy Notice, where we use ‚Äúdata‚Äù we mean the data types as described in
Section 4
.
What do Credit Reference Agencies do?
We collect information about you from various sources and build databases that hold this data.
We need to hold relevant permissions from the Financial Conduct Authority to collect and share this financial information about you.
Where do Credit Reference Agencies get information from?
The primary source of information we collect is from public records, such as court judgments (CCJs) and electoral register information, financial information from financial account providers, and information generated by us based on the information received and/or our own analytical research.
In addition, we may also collect information from payment accounts via the use of open banking, gambling organisations, employers, utilities suppliers, telecoms businesses as well as (business data only) from publicly available business websites.
Who uses the information, and what do they use it for?
Financial account providers and other organisations carry out searches against information with one or more of us.
Organisations can carry out searches for several reasons. These include assessing creditworthiness and ability to afford financial products, checking the accuracy of other information, preventing and detecting crime (such as fraud or money laundering), checking identity, locating individuals (for example to recover debts that they owe), calculating how much their insurance premiums should be, employment verification, including assessing their suitability for a job or a tenancy, and helping to protect individuals from the impacts of problem gambling.
When an organisation carries out a search of someone‚Äôs data, we will record details of that search. This is known as a search footprint. Depending on the type of search they can be visible to the individual and/or to other organisations that may conduct searches on that individual. Some organisations may draw adverse inference from the presence of some search footprints, for example if a person has multiple debt collection searches recorded.
We link people who appear to be financially associated, for example, through a joint account, joint application for credit or a joint County Court Judgment. This information on financial associates may be checked by companies when undertaking credit searches for the purposes of assessing credit risk. This is because your link with financial associates may affect your ability to repay debt.
Examples of this include, acting as guarantor for a personal loan that another individual is taking out, or in the capacity as a director or business owner, where the relevant business is applying for a commercial loan. See the table in
Section 4
for further information on how the financial associate‚Äôs data affects your credit report and score.
We also use some data for marketing-related purposes. Each of us provide different marketing services, to help organisations to better direct their marketing to consumers and (where relevant) business owners and directors, for example excluding individuals from advertising for credit products they would not be eligible for. We may also use the data to predict information or characteristics about the population, to inform product and marketing strategy, to help organisations identify who they want to market their products and services to, and how they should be delivered.
The data relating to you held by each of us might be different. This is because not every financial account provider supplies data to every one of us.
What else do Credit Reference Agencies do with my information?
We also use the data in our databases for other activities, including analytics and profiling. This can help financial account providers build scorecards to use in assessing credit applications.
We carry out several types of data processing to help achieve the aims described above. These include loading data, matching and linking data together, generating credit scores, as well as testing, developing and building products and services for our clients.
Individuals have certain rights that they can exercise in relation to the personal data held by us. For example, they have the right to obtain a copy of the data, to ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate, and to object to the processing of the data. The
ICO's website
provides more details on the available rights and details of how these rights can be exercised are set out in
Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12
below. Personal data about individuals in their role as owners, directors, and employees of UK businesses may also be obtained, processed and shared by commercial data sharing credit reference agencies not referenced in this Privacy Notice. For further information please refer to the
Business Information Providers Association‚Äôs website
.
Please note:
If you are looking for information about the role that data plays in lending decisions made by financial account providers, you may wish to consult Understanding your credit information and how lenders use it. This is published on the website of each of us,
Equifax
,
Experian
and
TransUnion
.
This document describes our common processing activities detailing how we use and distribute the data described in
Section 4
.
We are independent businesses. Not all of the products and services described in this document are provided by all three of us, or in the same way, and not all of the data is used by each of us.
This document does not cover all personal data that we use and distribute; for example, this document does not cover processing of personal data in relation to our services you sign up to directly, such as services which allow you to view your own credit report and score.
Each of us offers other products and services (including marketing services) not covered by this Privacy Notice.
Section 14
provides links to our own privacy notice(s) which outline other uses of data not fully described here that may be unique to one of us or includes additional detail about our core activities processing. The same links about our core processing activities are shown here below:

In this Privacy Notice, these three companies are referred to as Equifax, Experian and TransUnion respectively and collectively referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù throughout.
Controllers
Each of us is a controller of the data that we hold. This means that we have certain responsibilities under data protection law to make sure that the data is used fairly and lawfully.
Where we operate as part of a group of companies, we may share joint responsibility with the other members of that group when sharing data with them. You can contact the relevant credit reference agency using the details above if you want to enquire about any of those group companies or exercise any of your rights in respect of your personal data.
2. WHAT DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES USE DATA FOR?
We use data in products and services that we offer to our clients. The purposes for which those products and services are used are described below, but please note that different clients may use the products and services in different ways. Consumers should check the privacy policies of the organisations that they deal with for details about how they use any products and services provided by us.
(a) Credit risk assessment, financial vulnerability, and affordability checks
Each of us use data to provide credit reporting services, financial vulnerability and affordability checks to our clients.
CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT
Organisations use credit reporting services to see how people and businesses are managing payments in respect of their credit commitments and how they have done so in the past. For example, if a person applies for a bank loan to buy a car, the bank may use credit reporting services to check whether that person has kept up with their repayments on any previous credit agreements. It will then use this information, together with information from other sources, to assess the risk of offering the loan, including identifying any financial vulnerabilities.
A financial account provider may also take into account the creditworthiness of a director or business owner as part of its assessment, when considering whether to agree to lend to a business associated with such individuals.
It is important to note that once a search has been undertaken with one of us, it is for the credit provider to decide whether or not to accept that person‚Äôs application for credit. While we may help clients to analyse the data or create application models, we are not the decision maker.
AFFORDABILITY AND FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY CHECKS
Organisations use affordability checks made available by us to help understand whether people or businesses are likely to be able to afford to make payments, and to highlight financial vulnerabilities. For example, when you apply for a loan, the lender will check whether you have previously suffered a CCJ or missed credit payments, which might impact your ability to afford the repayment instalments.
Organisations might also check your affordability by reviewing the transaction data or the level of income and expenditure in relation to your payment account. This could include the use of open banking or current account turnover data provided by Current Account providers (‚ÄúCurrent Account‚Äù refers to bank accounts designed to be used for your day-to-day payment transactions).
The information provided as part of the affordability checks may affect a person‚Äôs or business‚Äôs ability to obtain credit or other services. For example, where an individual has their own business, a lender may take into consideration the personal credit commitments of that individual, as well as how the business is maintaining its financial commitments, prior to granting credit.
Affordability checks are also used by organisations in the gambling sector to help identify and protect potentially vulnerable people from the impacts of problem gambling by helping organisations set appropriate spending limits and implement appropriate engagement strategies. These checks are used to support gambling organisations comply with their regulatory obligations.
These activities help promote responsible lending, prevent people and businesses from getting into more debt than they can afford, and reduce the amount of unrecoverable debt and insolvencies.
(b) Checks to validate and verify client data, and help prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity
VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
We use data to provide validation and verification services to clients. For example:
Where some products and services are only available to people of a certain age, organisations may check whether the person they are dealing with is eligible by looking at data held by us. For example, if a person is signing up to join a gambling website for people who are at least 18 years old, the organisation may check to see if the age or date of birth provided by the person matches the data held by us.
HELP PREVENT AND DETECT FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
We also use data to help prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity, and apprehend and prosecute offenders.
When a person applies to an organisation for a product or service, the organisation might ask that person to answer questions about themselves, and then check the answers against the data held by us to see if they match. For example, they may ask ‚ÄúWhat is your current address?‚Äù If the address provided does not exist on our records (for example, because it is a fictitious address) or does not match the data held by us (for example, there is no record of the person at the address provided), this may be an indicator of a mistake or fraud.
When a person wants to make a payment to another person, the organisation making that payment might want to understand more about them. By using data about the person making the payment and the intended recipient, the organisation can determine if there are indicators of fraud present. If there are, the organisation may query the payment or take steps to stop it.
Government and quasi-government bodies may use our services to check for potential fraud or other criminal activities, whether people are entitled to certain benefits, and to help recover unpaid taxes, overpaid benefits and similar debts. For example, if a person is claiming single person discount for council tax, a local authority may check with us to see if any other adults are living at the same address. Conversely, public bodies may use our services to identify individuals who may be entitled to discounts but are not claiming them. For further details on government use of our data, refer to
Section 2(m)
.
Law enforcement agencies (including police forces, security services and border control) may also access/ use data held by us to assist with the investigation, prevention or detection of crime and criminal activity.
An indication of invalid or unverified information, fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity may affect (amongst other things) the outcome of an application for a product or service, a tenancy agreement or employment. If clients using the services identify potentially fraudulent activity, they may also pass the applicant‚Äôs details to a fraud prevention agency such as Cifas and/or to the police.
For more details about the fraud prevention services offered and the personal data used by each of us please refer to
Section 14
.
(c) Customer management
We use data to provide products and services for organisations to use for customer management purposes. Customer management is the ongoing maintenance of an organisation‚Äôs relationship with its customers. This could include activities designed to support:
data accuracy
: for example, to correct or update client customer data held on the organisation‚Äôs records, such as correcting spelling mistakes or adding missing fields; or providing services to link records together in order to show a single customer view; and
ongoing relationship and account management activities
: for example, to help organisations make decisions relating to credit limit adjustments, transaction authorisations, card reissue, lending requests, and to identify and manage the accounts of customers including those at risk of financial difficulties, showing signs of financial stress, in arrears, or going through a debt collection process. This may include ongoing monitoring of individuals‚Äô data, and sending alerts to clients in specified circumstances.
(d) Tracing and debt recovery
We use data to provide products and services that allow organisations to trace people. This is typically needed where a person has moved address or changed their telephone number and has not provided their new contact details. We help organisations locate customers they have lost contact with by providing them with updated addresses and other contact details.
The products and services are used to support organisations‚Äô debt recovery and debtor tracing activity. For example, if a person owes money to an organisation and moves to a new house without telling the organisation where they have moved to, the organisation may use these services to help find that person to recover the money that is owed to them.
We also assist debt collectors in predicting, analysing and evaluating the costs of debt recovery to enable them to determine appropriate collections strategies.
These products and services are also used to find people to let them know about assets that they may have forgotten about or not be aware of, such as old dormant savings accounts or pension funds, or to find people to let them know about assets of a deceased person which they have an interest in, such as administrators or beneficiaries of a deceased person‚Äôs estate.
Please also see
Section 2(h)
below which describes how we may provide tracing services for marketing purposes.
(e) Tenant vetting
We use data to provide products and services that allow landlords to verify some of the information provided by their prospective tenants, as well as confirming that they are who they say they are and that they are likely to be willing and able to pay their rent on time. Landlords can use this information to help decide whether to agree to the tenancy, or how much of a deposit they should ask for.
(f) Staff and job candidate vetting
We use data to provide products and services that allow organisations to verify some of the information provided by their staff and job candidates and confirm that they are who they say they are. They also enable employers to assess whether the staff member or candidate has a history of managing their own financial commitments well, or whether they are financially compromised. This can be used to help them decide whether the person would be or will continue to be a suitable member of staff.
(g) Insurance risk assessments and pricing
We use data to provide products and services for organisations to use to assess insurance risk. For example, an insurer may find that a person‚Äôs financial standing and history can be used to help predict how likely that person is to make a claim on an insurance policy, or how large that claim might be. This can help the insurer to decide (i) whether to provide insurance to a person, (ii) how much the insurance premium should be, and (iii) whether to allow payment for insurance on a credit instalment basis.
(h) Marketing and marketing-related services
OVERVIEW
We offer our clients marketing services. Some of these marketing services use data and some do not, and some impact consumers while others affect directors and/or business owners. For details about the marketing services offered and the personal data used by us for these services, please see the following links:
Experian | Consumer Information Portal
Experian | Marketing Transparency Notice | Business Information UK
Equifax | Privacy Hub | UK
TransUnion | Marketing Services Privacy Notice | UK
As well as other rights, consumers have the right to object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes, including any profiling that is related to direct marketing.
Section 11
sets out more details on how this right can be exercised.
If we provide marketing services, we may use an individual‚Äôs title, name (including aliases), address, date of birth, gender and address links information (see
Section 4
for more detail), as well as limited information relating to their financial standing.
SCREENING OUT
We use data to provide screening services to our clients. This means that we identify people who clients may wish to screen out of marketing lists. Screening is used to help ensure that individuals do not receive irrelevant or inappropriate marketing information. These individuals will most often be consumers, but we also provide screening services which impact on company directors and/or business owners for our clients who carry out business-to-business marketing activities.
For example, a client may want to screen out from its marketing list someone who is deceased, or who is under 18, or does not reside at the address they hold, or who may not be interested in a product or service or is unlikely to be accepted for it.
OTHER MARKETING-RELATED ACTIVITIES
In addition, we may use data to offer some or all of the following marketing services:
We may supply the open version of the electoral register (where people have not opted out from their electoral register data being used for marketing and other purposes) to organisations for marketing purposes. This can include identifying new potential customers, verifying that names, addresses and dates of birth collected from other sources are accurate and complete, and informing customers of any errors.
We may identify when someone has moved away from an address so that marketing is not sent to them at that old address.
We may trace individuals to a new address so that their marketing preferences (opt-outs) collected at a previous address can continue to apply at their new address and so that marketing is not sent to them at their old address.
We may help build insight using profiling techniques used by organisations to help them identify people that they want to communicate with about particular products and services. This insight might predict, for example, age, marital status, household composition, length of residency at an address and gender. It can help give organisations insight into the likely characteristics of the UK population at an individual, household and postcode level. Data also helps us to validate the insight being created. This insight might also be used to help clients assess the financial standing of a person so that they can personalise their interactions with them and make communications more relevant and suitable. For example, they could use the insight to select products or offers that they believe would be relevant to that person.
Models and insight created by us can be matched to clients‚Äô own contact lists so that they can make better informed decisions about how they interact with individuals (both consumers and company directors and/or business owners).
We may confirm whether individuals are resident at the address that we or our clients hold for them. This can be done by checking the data to see if there are any open credit accounts at an address and whether the accounts have recent activity, such as where a recent payment has been made. If they do, then it is likely that they have the correct address details. This will help ensure that an individual does not receive marketing for someone else and our clients do not send marketing to the wrong address.
We may also use data to help keep our own marketing suppression lists (or those of our group companies) accurate and up to date. For example, if you have previously asked to be excluded from marketing activity and your data indicates that you have since moved or changed your name, that information can be used to make sure that you continue to be excluded from marketing activity at your new address or under your new name.
(i) Profiling, statistical analysis and anonymisation
We use, and allow our clients to use, data to carry out profiling of consumers through statistical analysis. This includes the creation, validation and use of scorecards, models, and attributes in connection with the assessment of risks relating to credit, fraud, affordability, financial vulnerability and debt collection. It is also used in verifying identities, to monitor and predict market trends and to enable clients to refine lending and fraud strategies, and loss forecasting. This can include drawing inferences about individuals on the basis of the data available, such as inferences about whether a credit application they have made has been accepted or declined.
These practices profile consumers (typically a client‚Äôs own customers or previous applicants) to help determine the likelihood that a consumer with certain characteristics will act in a way that will produce certain outcomes; for example, to repay credit, to be able to afford credit, to claim on an insurance policy, to commit fraud, to respond to certain collection strategies or to become insolvent.
We may also convert personal data into statistical or aggregated form so that individuals are not identified or identifiable (thereby creating anonymised data). Anonymised data is not personal data, and we may use such data to conduct research and analysis, including to produce statistical research and reports or for any other purposes.
We may share this anonymised data with organisations, such as those identified in
Section 5
. For example, this non personal data may be shared with government and public sector organisations to help them: assess the impact of changes to the financial economy on consumers and businesses; to inform policy setting and monitor the effectiveness of policy implementation; or to enable tailored economic support and other key resources to be directed to the groups that need it the most.
(j) Data management activities
We use data to carry out certain processing activities to support our own business operations. This includes supporting the effectiveness, efficiency and security of our databases, products and services, both in the context of our credit reference activities and more widely. For example:
Data loading: data is checked for integrity, validity, consistency, quality and age to help make sure it is accurate. These checks pick up issues such as irregular dates of birth, names, addresses, account start and default dates, and gaps in status history.
Data matching: data is matched to our existing databases to help make sure it is assigned to the right person, even when there are discrepancies like spelling mistakes or previous names or different versions of a person‚Äôs name. We use data to create and confirm identities, which we use to underpin the services that we provide.
Data linking: when we compile data into our databases, we create links between different pieces of information. For example, people who appear financially associated with each other may be linked together and a person can be linked with their previous and current addresses. Also, where someone has an alias, such as a maiden name and married name, these names will be linked.
System maintenance and testing: data may be used when carrying out system maintenance, repair and testing, and security activity.
Each of us have our own processes and standards for data management activity.
(k) New development and testing
We use data to help develop new products, services and technologies and to test them. This may include the controlled use of artificial intelligence or machine learning techniques. We may combine data with information from other parts of our businesses and use data to develop products, services and technologies in other parts of our businesses. Where appropriate, we will anonymise data before it is used for these purposes.
(l) Compliance with laws
We use and disclose data where required by law. For example, this can happen in response to a court order or a request from a regulator, or in order to comply with a request from a person (or by a third party acting on their behalf), to exercise their legal rights in respect of any personal data, such as by requesting a copy of it.
(m) Government and public sector organisations
We may provide data to government and public sector organisations. For example, their uses of this data could include:
the assessment or collection of any taxes, duties, or other such impositions; recovering unpaid income tax, council tax or national insurance contributions;
recovering unpaid television licence fees;
benefits eligibility assessment and monitoring (for example, by checking for changes in circumstances that would affect established eligibility);
the assessment or collection of any payments due to a public sector organisation in carrying out a statute or other legal obligation;
the detection and prevention of a crime, and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders;
the detection, prevention and recovery of improper payments or overpayments from public funds; and
for the purposes of any legal proceedings (including prospective legal proceedings).
3. WHAT ARE THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES‚Äô LEGAL GROUNDS FOR HANDLING CREDIT REFERENCE DATA?
Data protection law requires us to always have what is referred to as a ‚Äúlawful basis‚Äù (i.e. a reason or justification) for processing personal data. There are a number of lawful bases available, but the majority of our data processing activity is on the basis that:
the processing is necessary to pursue our
legitimate interests
and those of third parties (such as our clients), and those interests do not unduly prejudice the rights and freedoms of individuals; or
the processing is necessary to comply with a
legal obligation
binding on us.
For information about any other lawful basis relied on by each of us, please review our individual privacy notices (see
Section 14
).
LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
We use data to pursue our legitimate interests, those of our clients and those of individuals. The following table explains these legitimate interests. We have carried out assessments and concluded that these interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
Interest
Explanation
Promoting responsible lending and helping to prevent over-indebtedness
Responsible lending means that lenders only sell products that are affordable and suitable for the borrowers‚Äô circumstances. This is in the interests of borrowers so that they do not become burdened with debt that they cannot afford to repay, and the stress associated with that. It is also in the interests of lenders in that it reduces bad debt and collections activity.
We facilitate responsible lending by providing services that allow lenders to access information about a person (and anyone they have a financial association with, such as a joint account holder), including how they are managing current debt, have managed debt in the past and whether they have sufficient income to repay the debt.
Helping prevent and detect fraud, money laundering and validate and verify identity
We provide identity, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering services to help clients meet legal and regulatory obligations. These services benefit individuals by facilitating prompt access to services through identity verification, and helping to protect them against fraud, and other criminal activity.
Prevention and detection of fraud, money laundering and other criminal activity is in our legitimate interest and that of our clients. It is also to the benefit of wider society and therefore in the public interest.
Customer and data management activities for the benefit of consumers and businesses.
We provide services which help businesses maintain the quality of their own customer data they hold and to make informed decisions about how they engage with their customers.
It is in our legitimate interests to offer these services to our clients, but it is also in the legitimate interests of both the consumer and businesses by helping ensure that the information held about them is accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date and that informed and responsible decisions can be made, particularly in the context of lending decisions.
Supporting tracing and debt recovery
We provide services that support tracing and collections where the client has a legitimate interest in conducting activity to find its customers and to recover debt, or to reunite, or confirm that an asset relates to the right person.
Enabling landlords to check the suitability of their prospective tenants
We enable landlords to verify some of the information provided by their prospective tenants, as well as confirming that they are who they say they are and that they are likely to be willing and able to pay their rent on time. This helps the landlord to decide whether to agree to the tenancy, or how much of a deposit they should ask for; and it reduces the risk that the tenancy relationship will subsequently break down. It also helps tenants to avoid getting into legal difficulties where they have agreed to pay rent that they cannot afford.
Enabling employers to check the suitability of their current and prospective staff
We enable employers to verify some of the information provided by their staff and job candidates and confirm that they are who they say they are. They also enable employers to assess whether the staff member or candidate has a history of managing their own financial commitments well, or whether they are financially compromised. This can help reduce the risk of fraud and can help the employer to decide whether the person is or would be a suitable member of its staff. All of which is in the legitimate interest of those employers.
Enabling insurers to calculate and price risk more accurately
We enable insurers to consider certain kinds of data when they are assessing risk. This data can help the insurer decide whether to provide cover to a person, and how much the insurance premium should be. This enables them to better forecast their future liability and to price their insurance products more accurately and competitively. For consumers, it means that insurance policies are priced more fairly, with the lowest-risk individuals paying less for their insurance.
Supporting government and public sector organisations in the performance of their duties
We enable government and public sector organisations to consider certain kinds of data to help them in the performance of their duties. For example, this could include the assessment or collection of taxes; benefits eligibility assessment and monitoring; and the detection, prevention and recovery of improper payments or overpayments from public funds. This enables them to protect public money and ensure it is used effectively. This is in the public interest. For consumers, it means that their tax contributions are utilised efficiently and effectively and that the right benefits and entitlements are granted to them.
Supporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
Our services may be used by our clients to help them comply with their own regulatory obligations, for example, complying with anti-money laundering obligations and regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (‚ÄòFCA‚Äô) which require lenders to assess the creditworthiness of individuals who apply for loans. This is in the legitimate interest of clients.
Our services are also regulated and may use data to ensure our own legal and regulatory compliance. As part of this compliance, regulators may also ask us to provide information to assist them. For example, the FCA may ask for data to help inform them of areas of potential harm to allow them to identify areas where they should focus their resources.
Further, these regulatory obligations are in place in the interests of wider society, so facilitating compliance with them indirectly benefits society as a whole, which is in the public interest.
Promoting responsible, efficient and informed marketing activities for the benefit of consumers and businesses
We provide services to support organisations in ensuring that their marketing strategies are responsible, informed and efficient. This helps them to reduce waste (driving costs down and increasing competition) and avoid sending communications to individuals who are less likely to be interested in receiving them or who should not receive them.
Commercial interests
It is in each of our legitimate interests to provide the services described above to our clients to generate sales revenues.
Enabling gambling organisations to meet their obligations to protect individuals from the impacts of problem gambling
Our services may be used by organisations to help protect individuals from the impacts associated with problem gambling and gambling related harms. Excessive spending on gambling at the expense of payment of priority household debts (such as mortgage or rent payments) could have a significant financial impact on the individual and family unit.  This is in the legitimate interests of gambling organisations and supports them to comply with their regulatory obligations, whilst also being in the legitimate interests of individuals.
There are wider societal benefits, including reducing the burden on public health services and impacts on the economy.
Our use of data is subject to an extensive framework of safeguards that balance the legitimate interests set out above with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people whose data we use and share. The framework includes information given to people about how their data will be used and how they can exercise their rights to obtain their personal data, have it corrected, erased, or restricted, object to it being processed, and complain if they are dissatisfied. It also includes extensive due diligence checks on clients, robust contractual arrangements, and internal data management processes that we have in place. These safeguards help sustain a fair and appropriate balance and to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals.
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS
In some circumstances we are required by law to use or share data in particular ways. This happens, for example, when a court, law enforcement agency or regulator makes a legally binding request or order for disclosure of data. It also happens when individual consumers exercise their rights, for example by requesting a copy of their own personal data from us.
4. WHAT KINDS OF DATA DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES USE, AND WHERE DO THEY GET IT FROM?
Each of us obtains and uses data (including your personal data) from different sources, so we often hold information that is different to some degree from that held by the others.
However, most of the personal data we each hold falls into the categories outlined below from the sources described (please note that some of this data may relate to individuals from the Crown Dependencies as well as from the UK).
Information type
Description
Source
Identifiers
We hold personal data that can be used to identify people, such as name, date of birth, and current and previous addresses. We may also hold business data including name, address and details of company shareholders and directors.
We may also hold business data including name, address and details of company shareholders and directors.
This data is part of some of the other data sources mentioned below in this table.
Data about postal addresses is obtained from commercial sources such as Royal Mail.
Data about businesses may also be sourced from public websites, including Companies House and companies‚Äô own websites.
Electoral register data
We hold information from the electoral register (also known as the ‚ÄòElectoral Roll‚Äô). There are two versions of this. One is known as the open register (also known as the ‚ÄòEdited Electoral Roll‚Äô or ‚ÄòEER‚Äô) and can be used for a variety of purposes including marketing. The other is the full register which we can only use for limited purposes.
This data is supplied by local authorities.
Credit account performance data
We receive personal data about how people are managing to repay their credit commitments.
The data includes the name of the lending organisation, the date the account was opened, the account number, the amount of debt outstanding (if any), any credit available (including overdraft limits) and the repayment history on the account, including late and missing payments. This may also include transactions that have been made on a buy now pay later basis.
This data is provided from banks, building societies and other financial services providers such as credit card companies, credit suppliers, credit unions, hire purchase companies and buy now pay later organisations. It is also provided by utilities companies, mobile phone networks, retail and mail order companies and insurance companies.
Rental related data
Some of us receive personal data about whether people are managing to pay their rent on time.
The data includes tenancy reference, start date, end date, rental amount, arrangement amount and outstanding balance.
This data is provided by social housing providers and private landlords. You can also sign up to certain services which identify your rent payments from your bank account transactions and report them to us.
Current Account turnover data
This data includes the name of the organisation providing Current Accounts, current account numbers, sort codes, the number of account holders, the current balance, a figure for credits on each current account and sometimes a figure for debits.
This data is provided from organisations who offer people Current Accounts, such as banks and building societies and e-money institutions.
Application salary data
This data consists of the salary declared by a person when they are applying for credit. It also includes whether that figure is net or gross, and whether the salary has been verified (e.g. with copies of salary slips). This data also includes the date that an application was made.
This data is provided to us by organisations who collect declared income from individuals when they apply for credit.
This information is provided as a separate file of data, although declared income can sometimes be provided together with other data (see search footprints below).
Open Banking data
This data includes details of the financial transactions within your payment account(s) accessed via Open Banking (including details of payment amounts, dates, payees and payers).
This data is made available by your account provider, where access to the account has been specifically authorised by you.
For example, this may be to help support a credit application you are making to a lender or as proof of your income.
We are only permitted to obtain this data through being FCA registered Account Information Service Providers or though working with firms that hold this FCA permission.
For more details of how each credit reference agency provides open banking services, please see the privacy notices of each credit reference agency, a link to which is provided in
Section 14
.
Judgment data
We obtain data about court judgments and decrees. This may include, for example, the name of the court, the nature of the judgment, how much money was owed, and whether the judgment has been satisfied.
The government makes court judgments and other decrees and administrative orders publicly available through statutory public registers. These are maintained by Registry Trust Limited, which supplies the data on the registers to us.
Insolvency data
We obtain data about insolvency-related events. This includes data about bankruptcies, administration orders, individual voluntary arrangements, debt relief orders, sequestrations, trust deeds and debt arrangement schemes. This data includes the start and end dates of the relevant insolvency or arrangement.
This data is obtained from The Insolvency Service, the Accountant in Bankruptcy, The Stationary Office and Northern Ireland‚Äôs Department for the Economy ‚Äì Insolvency Service, the London, Belfast and Edinburgh Gazettes and Registry Trust Limited.
Business insolvency data is obtained from the London, Belfast and Edinburgh Gazettes.
Fraud prevention indicators
This data consists of information which indicates that an individual has demonstrated behaviour that appears to be consistent with that of known fraudulent conduct. It also consists of information where an individual has been a victim of identity fraud or feels that his or her personal data is vulnerable due to a data breach.
This data is generated internally by us and also obtained from third parties such as Cifas, a not-for-profit fraud prevention membership organisation.
Search footprints
When an organisation uses us to make enquiries about a person, we keep a record of that enquiry. This is known as a ‚Äòsearch footprint‚Äô. This includes the name of the organisation, the date, and the purpose for which the enquiry was made.
We may also receive additional data that was provided as part of the search, such as employment status, disclosed income (income sometimes provided separately as application salary data) and contact information.
Some footprints are visible only to us and the individual about whom they are made. Other searches are also visible to other organisations, and in some cases can therefore affect credit decisions (e.g. where an organisation draws a negative inference from a debt collection search).
We generate search footprints automatically when enquiries are made about a person.
Each credit reference agency only creates search footprints for searches against its own records.
Scores
We and our clients use data to produce scores including in relation to credit, affordability, fraud, identity, collections and insolvency.
We use algorithms known as ‚Äòscorecards‚Äô to produce scores. Similarly, other organisations create their own scores from data obtained from us as well as other sources.
Other third-party data
This data includes phone numbers and email addresses, data concerning politically exposed persons (PEPs) and people on sanctions lists as well as mortality data.
We receive this data from reputable commercial sources under contracts agreed from time to time.
Other additional information credit reference agencies create (not already referred to in this table)
We derive certain additional information from the data. For example:
Summarised and aggregated data
: we can summarise data, for example by providing a count of the total number of accounts or judgments a person has, or the total amount of debt. We can also aggregate data about different consumers together, for example to provide an overview of the financial status of particular postcodes and other geographical areas. This may then be anonymised data.
Address links
: when we detect that a person has moved to a new house, we may create and store a link between the old and new address.
Aliases
: when we believe that a person has changed their name, we may record the old name alongside the new one.
Financial associations and linked people
: when we believe that two or more people are financially linked with each other (for example, because they have a joint account, apply for credit together, such as a mortgage or loan, or get a joint County Court Judgment), we may record that fact. Just sharing an address with someone or even being married to them (but not having any joint credit) does not make them a financial associate.
Your financial associates can impact your ability to get credit. They appear on your credit report, and companies may check their credit history when deciding whether to approve you. This is because your financial associates may affect your ability to repay debt. For example, if your partner has been made bankrupt, companies may be concerned that you will need to help them repay their debts before you can repay your own. Credit scores you receive through services you sign-up for may reflect and explain the impact of a financial associate on your ability to get credit.
Flags and triggers
: we may create flags and triggers that we use in our systems to highlight that certain data exists or to summarise that data. For example, if we hold fraud data from the fraud organisation known as Cifas, we may create a flag indicating this fact. This flag would highlight to clients that the data is available and give them the opportunity to ask for more details.
We generate this additional information from the data sources already available to us.
Data provided by individuals themselves
People sometimes provide data about themselves directly to us. For example, individuals have the right to ask us to add a short statement that will be displayed when an organisation sees data about them. This statement is known as a ‚Äònotice of correction‚Äô and can be used to allow the person to explain the reason for an entry. The right to do this is explained in
Section¬†10
below).
If a person exercises any of their other legal rights, we will retain data relating to these activities, for example, records will be kept of all actions and correspondence relating to managing complaints.
This data is provided directly by individuals themselves.
5. WHO DO CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES SHARE DATA WITH?
This section describes the types of organisations we share data with. Before sharing data with any third party we will, where appropriate, complete our own due diligence checks to ensure that the organisation is a real business and has applicable regulatory authorisations in place.
Clients
We supply our products and services to clients in various sectors, such as banks, building societies, other credit providers, buy now-pay later providers, utility companies, mobile phone companies, insurance companies, employers, credit report providers, retailers, gambling organisations, tenant and employee vetting firms, professional services organisations (such as firms of solicitors and accountants), estate agents, landlords, marketing companies, charities and public bodies such as the police, central and local government and regulators.
Certain organisations that share financial data with us are members of closed user groups which entitle them to receive similar kinds of financial data contributed by other organisations in the group. These organisations are typically banks, building societies, and other lenders, as well as other credit providers like utilities companies, mobile phone networks and other organisations like gambling firms.
Resellers, distributors, partners, agents and other third parties
We sometimes use or partner up with other third party organisations to provide combined products or products which combine our data with other information to help provide our products and services to clients and to help us improve our own products and services. To do this, we may provide data to third parties so that they can provide the services.
Service providers
We may use other external organisations and other members of our own groups of companies to perform tasks on their behalf (for example, IT service providers, call centre providers and security service providers). To do this, we may provide or make available data to them so that they can perform the tasks.
Fraud prevention agencies
Each of us is a member of Cifas, a not-for-profit fraud prevention service. Where we believe that you may have been a victim of fraud, we may share that information with Cifas so that other Cifas members can access it. This enables other Cifas members to check when (for example) a credit application is made in your name. Please refer to the
Cifas‚Äô privacy notice
for more details.
Government and other public sector organisations
We may share information with government and other public sector organisations, including the following bodies: ministerial government departments, such as the Department of Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs, HM Treasury, the Cabinet Office; publicly owned corporations and other arm‚Äôs length bodies such as the Public Sector Fraud Authority) and private sector organisations providing services on behalf of a public sector organisations, such as a housing association acting on behalf of a local authority.
Regulators
Regulators, such as the Financial Conduct Authority, Competition & Markets Authority, Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office, Ofgem and Ofwat, can sometimes request or require us to supply them with personal data. This can be for a range of purposes such as investigating complaints or in response to legal obligations. The regulators may also need data insights from us when assessing how well a particular industry sector is working.
Law enforcement agencies
This includes police forces, security services and border control.
Individuals
People are entitled to obtain copies of the personal data we hold about them. Details on how to do this are set out in
Section 9
below.
6. WHERE IS DATA STORED AND SENT?
All three of us are based in the UK and keep our main databases there. We may also have operations and service providers elsewhere inside and outside the UK and the European Economic Area, and data may be accessed from those locations too. Regardless of where the data is processed, we ensure that it is always protected by applicable UK and European data protection standards.
While the UK and countries in the European Economic Area all ensure a high standard of data protection law, some parts of the world may not provide the same level of legal protection when it comes to personal data. As a result, when we send data overseas we make sure suitable safeguards are in place in accordance with applicable UK and European data protection requirements, to protect the data. For example, these safeguards might include:
Sending the data to a country that has been approved by the relevant authorities as having a suitably high standard of data protection law. Examples include the Isle of Man, Switzerland and Canada.
Putting in place a contract with the receiving organisation containing terms approved by the relevant authorities as providing a suitable level of protection.
Sending the data to an organisation which is a member of a scheme that has been approved by the relevant authorities as providing a suitable level of protection. One example is the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (UK-US ‚ÄúData Bridge‚Äù) agreed between the UK and US authorities.
Overseas recipients of data include our group companies, clients, resellers and service providers. Please see
Section 5
for more information about recipients of data.
More information about the safeguards we each use can be obtained by contacting us at the contact details in
Section 1
above.
7. FOR HOW LONG IS DATA RETAINED?
Each of us may retain data for different periods of time. Information about our respective retention periods can be found at the following locations:
Equifax:
Equifax I CRAIN - Data Retention Periods
Experian:
Experian | CRAIN Data Retention Periods
TransUnion:
TransUnion | CRAIN Data Retention Periods
These periods are subject to regular review and may change from time to time.
8. DO THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS OR PROFILE THEM?
DECISIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS
We do not tell organisations what decisions to make about consumers. Our role is primarily to provide information to other organisations which supports them in making their own decisions as this is for each organisation to decide. For example, we do not tell lenders whether to offer credit to consumers; we just provide services that help those lenders make decisions about consumers. An organisation‚Äôs own data, knowledge, processes and practices will also play a significant role in those decisions.
We may provide similar services to our respective clients, but these services may lead to different decisions because (i) each credit reference agency may hold different information from the others, (ii) each client may place differing importance on some information compared to others, and (iii) each client may take into account information available to it from other sources. These are some of the reasons why a person may receive a ‚Äúyes‚Äù from one lender but a ‚Äúno‚Äù from another.
SCORES AND RATINGS
When requested, we use the data we obtain to produce credit, risk, fraud, identity, affordability, screening, collection and insolvency scores and ratings; these are explained in
Section 4
above. In providing these scores and ratings to our clients, we are not making decisions about consumers or telling organisations what decisions to make about consumers ‚Äì this is for each organisation to decide on the basis of their own criteria.
9. HOW CAN A CONSUMER SEE WHAT DATA THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES HOLD ABOUT THEM? DO CONSUMERS HAVE A ‚ÄòDATA PORTABILITY‚Äô RIGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR DATA?
Data access right
Consumers have the right to find out what personal data we hold about them. Each of us provides more information about access rights on our websites.

DATA PORTABILITY RIGHT
Data protection legislation also contains a right to data portability. Where it applies, the right to data portability gives consumers a right to receive their personal data in a standard format. However, this right only applies when personal data is processed on certain lawful grounds, such as consent. This right does not apply to our data because it is processed on the grounds of ‚Äúlegitimate interests‚Äù. To find out more about legitimate interests please go to
Section 3
above.
10. WHAT CAN A CONSUMER DO IF THEIR CREDIT REFERENCE DATA IS WRONG?
When the credit reference agencies receive personal data, they perform lots of checks on it to try and detect any defects or mistakes. Ultimately, though, the credit reference agencies rely on their suppliers to provide accurate data.
If a consumer thinks that any personal data a credit reference agency holds about them is wrong or incomplete, the consumer has the right to challenge it. If challenged, the credit reference agency will need to take reasonable steps to check the data, such as asking the organisation that supplied it to check and confirm its accuracy.
If the data turns out to be wrong, the credit reference agency will update its records accordingly. If the credit reference agency still believes that the data is correct after completing their checks, they will continue to hold and use it. Where the data is part of the consumer‚Äôs credit report, they can ask the credit reference agency to add a supplementary statement of up to 200 words explaining their views about the information. This statement will be supplied to organisations who subsequently access the information that the consumer has disputed.
To do this, consumers should contact the relevant credit reference agency using the contact details in
Section 1
above. Where more than one credit reference agency holds incorrect information, it may be necessary to contact them separately.
11. CAN A CONSUMER OBJECT TO THE USE OF THEIR CREDIT REFERENCE DATA AND HAVE IT DELETED?
This section helps consumers understand how to exercise their data protection rights to object to data being used by us and how to ask for it to be deleted. To understand these rights and how they apply to the processing of data, it is important to know that we hold and process personal data under the ‚Äúlegitimate interests‚Äù basis for processing (see
Section 3
above for more information about this), and do not rely on consent.
Consumers have the right to object to the processing of personal data by us. This can be done by contacting the relevant credit reference agency using the contact details in
Section 1
above.
Although consumers have complete freedom to contact us with objections at any time, under data protection law, a consumer‚Äôs right to object does not automatically lead to a requirement for processing to stop, or for personal data to be deleted.
Because of the importance of the credit referencing industry to the UK‚Äôs financial system, and the important purposes for which the data is needed (such as supporting responsible lending, and preventing over-indebtedness, fraud and money laundering) we will normally have compelling, overriding grounds to carry on using the personal data following an objection. In many cases, it will not be appropriate for us to restrict or to stop processing or delete data, for example, where the result would be to hide a poor credit history that could enable a person or organisation to get credit they otherwise would not be eligible for.
However, as an exception from the general rule described above, all consumers have an absolute right to object to their personal data being used for direct marketing purposes. If you object to us using your personal data for those purposes, you can get us to stop by contacting us using the details in
Section 1
or specifically, in the case of Experian, through the online service at
https://www.experianmarketingservices.digital/OptOut
.
12. CAN A CONSUMER RESTRICT WHAT THE CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES DO WITH THEIR DATA?
In some circumstances, consumers can ask us to restrict how we use their data. Contact details for each credit reference agency are in
Section 1
above.
This is not an absolute right and processing will only be restricted if certain conditions are met (for example, if the processing is unlawful or the personal data is no longer required by us for the purposes for which it was obtained).
Even where a restriction condition is met, a consumer‚Äôs personal data may still be processed (and shared) by us where certain grounds exist. These are:
with the consumer‚Äôs consent
for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims
for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person
for reasons of important public interest
We will consider and respond to requests we receive and will assess whether any of the restriction conditions apply and, if they do, whether there are any grounds that permit the continued processing of the personal data.
Given the importance of complete and accurate data, for purposes including, for example, for responsible lending and preventing over-indebtedness, fraud and money laundering, it will usually be appropriate for us to continue processing data on the basis of protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. Consumers can contact us to ask about this processing of their personal data so that they can understand how their data will be used.
13. WHO CAN A CONSUMER COMPLAIN TO IF THEY ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE USE OF THEIR DATA?

The FOS is an independent public body that aims to resolve disputes between consumers and businesses like credit reference agencies.
If you live in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, this service is also available to you because we are UK based businesses.

About Ad Settings
We and our 918 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.
Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest.
View our list of partners
to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.
The Consent Signal (TC String) is stored in the Local Storage with a maximum retention period of 13 months, after which a renewed consent decision is required. Find out more about how your personal data is processed and set your preferences below.
Purposes
14
You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data. You can object to legitimate interest processing per purpose.
Store and/or access information on a device
Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:
Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Use limited data to select advertising
Legitimate Interest
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Vendors

Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.
Vendors
528
Use profiles to select personalised advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:
An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.
Vendors
523
Create profiles to personalise content
Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.
Vendors

Use profiles to select personalised content
Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:
You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:
You have clicked on an advertisement about a ‚Äúblack Friday‚Äù discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an ‚Äúinternational appreciation day‚Äù discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the ‚Äúinternational appreciation day‚Äù ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Vendors
762
Measure content performance
Legitimate Interest
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Vendors
379
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Legitimate Interest
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Vendors
483
Develop and improve services
Legitimate Interest
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.
Vendors
569
Use limited data to select content
Legitimate Interest
Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:
A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school‚Äôs blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors
Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:
An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.
Deliver and present advertising and content
Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:
Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1¬∞) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2¬∞) the server answers back (‚Äúhere is the article you asked for‚Äù), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.
Save and communicate privacy choices
The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:
When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.

How we use personal data as a credit reference agency
The more lenders know about the people and businesses they're providing credit to, the better decisions they make. This means they can lend at lower rates and offer better deals to more people. Credit reference agencies (CRAs) like us provide this information to lenders in the form of credit reports that include your financial information from the last six years. If you need any help understanding what's in your credit report, Experian offers a range of services to help you -

What we do with data as part of our Marketing Services
We all see marketing from different companies every day and our Marketing Services business believe that when done properly, marketing can bring significant benefit to people, organisations, and wider society.
We provide data and insights to help bring businesses and consumers together. And, we help ensure the marketing messages you may receive are relevant.

How we use data in our fraud and identity services
We work hard to help protect you from fraud. When you log in to websites of other companies, open accounts and access online banking, we often provide services in the background that shield you from fraudsters who may want to steal your identity or apply for credit in your name. We also offer services for consumers to help you to quickly spot if you've been a victim of fraud and understand how you can prove who you are safely online.

How we use data in our business services
We help companies deliver better customer service, create smoother online experiences and improve business efficiency. We allow them to confirm the accuracy of customer information, reunite them with less engaged customers, and pair consumers with assets they've lost track of, like pensions and investments. Not all of these services involve personal data, on some occasions we act only to help other companies manage and share their data.
Your data rights
It's important that people and businesses understand their rights when it comes to their data. We make sure:
You can see what data we hold about you and that you can correct anything that's wrong.
In some cases you can control how we use your data.
What data do we hold about you and why do we have it?
We hold a range of data about people and companies for a variety of reasons. If we hold data about you it's because of one or more of the following:
You've created a free Experian account or have used one of our paid subscriptions.
You have a UK bank or credit account with a lender or other financial provider that shares information with us.
You're a UK company that's used one of our business services.
Your personal data has been shared with us from data partners who have direct contact with you already, and where appropriate notice has been given for them to pass your information to us.
We obtain your personal data from publicly available sources, including the government, local authorities and other public bodies. This helps organisations build products and services that are just right for you.
