‍
Who may have access to your Candidate Data
We may disclose personal information contained in Candidate Data to the following categories of recipients:
We will share your Candidate Personal Information with our HR team. We may share some of Candidate Personal Information with Processors engaged by us to provide services we require to use Candidate Personal Information for permitted purposes. Such Processors operate under our instruction. We ensure that any Processor we use takes adequate measures to protect your Candidate Personal Information, by signing a data processing agreement with it.
Because we operate our business as a corporate group of companies, we may also share your Candidate Personal Information with our affiliated companies in the Playtika family (e.g. Playtika Ltd. (Israel), Playtika Holding Corp. (US) and its subsidiaries) where lawful to share and for legitimate purposes such as  for the same purposes set out above.
Where required by law, we will also disclose your Candidate Personal Information to a governmental authority.
Any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
We do not sell your Candidate Personal Information to third parties.
International Transfers
Wooga operates globally, which means your Candidate Data may be stored and processed outside of the country or region where it was originally collected.
We use a recruiting software tool provided by Greenhouse Software Inc., 18 West 18th Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10011, US (“Greenhouse”). Your data will be stored and processed on Greenhouse servers in the US for this purpose.
When we allow transfers of personal data to third countries outside the European Economic Area, this is based on Art. 44 et seq. GDPR, so only on the basis of an adequacy decision of the European Commission or other appropriate safeguards (e.g. the standard contractual clauses).
Our retention of your Candidate Data
We will store your information for as long as we need to for recruiting purposes. This will never be longer than six months after we have shared the outcome of your application - unless we ask for and receive your explicit consent to store your data in our talent pool for a longer period, e.g. for future openings (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. (a) and (f) GDPR, Sec. 26 para. 1 and 3 of the German Data Protection Act (
BDSG
) ), or we are obliged by law to keep the data for a longer period.
We retain this information for various reasons, including in case we face a legal challenge in respect of a recruitment decision, to consider you for other current or future jobs at Wooga and to help us better understand, analyze and improve our recruitment processes.
If you do not want us to retain your Candidate Data for consideration for other roles, or want us to update it, please contact
privacy@wooga.net
Security
We implement measures to reduce the risks of damage, loss of information and unauthorized access or use of Candidate Personal Information. We also request our affiliates to implement such measures in order to secure the information we provide them. However, although efforts are made to secure Candidate Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute protection.
Legal Basis for Processing
The legal basis under EU law for processing your Candidate Personal Information to evaluate your candidacy is both our legitimate interests in properly reviewing your candidacy and assessing your application to work at Wooga and for steps we need to take prior to entering into an employment contract with you.
The legal basis under EU law for retaining your Candidate Personal Information for further processing for future job openings is our legitimate interests in considering you for other job openings we may have.
The legal basis under EU law for retaining your Candidate Personal Information for recordkeeping purposes is our legitimate interest in asserting or defending legal claims that impact the course of our business or reputation.
Where we collect sensitive personal information from you, we will do so normally only with your explicit consent or where we have an obligation under employment law to process such information.
Your rights under the GDPR
Right to Access and receive a copy of your Candidate Personal Information that we Process.
Right to Rectify inaccurate Candidate Personal Information we have concerning you and to have incomplete Personal Information completed.
Right to Data Portability - that is, to receive the Candidate Personal Information that you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit this data to another person or entity. Where technically feasible, you have the right to have your Candidate Personal Information transmitted directly from us to the person or entity you designate.
Right to Object to our Processing of your Candidate Personal Information on the basis of our legitimate interest. However, we may override the objection if we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds, or if we need to Process such Candidate Personal Information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to Restrict us from Processing your Candidate Personal Information (except for storing it): (a) if you contest the accuracy of the Candidate Personal Information (in which case the restriction applies only for a period enabling us to determine the accuracy of the Candidate Personal Information); (b) if the Processing is unlawful and you prefer to restrict the Processing of the Candidate Personal Information rather than requiring the deletion of such data by us; (c) if we no longer need the Candidate Personal Information for the purposes outlined in this Notice, but you require the Candidate Personal Information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) if you object to our Processing based on our legitimate interest (in which case the restriction applies only for the period enabling us to determine whether our legitimate grounds for processing override yours).
Right to be Forgotten. Under certain circumstances, such as when our Processing of your Candidate Personal Information is based on your consent, you have the right to ask us to erase your Candidate Personal Information. However, notwithstanding such request, we may still process your Candidate Personal Information if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to withdraw your consent at any time.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us as listed above.
When you contact us, we reserve the right to ask for reasonable evidence to verify your identity before we provide you with information. Where we are not able to provide you with information that you have asked for, we will explain the reason.
Subject to applicable law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. According to Article 77 of the GDPR, you can lodge a complaint to the supervisory authority, in the Member State of your residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR.
