1.
Types of personal information we process
Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. The types of personal information that we process are determined by how individuals interact with us and the particular products and services that we provide. The types of personal information that we process include:
Identifiers
, such as name, email address, username, IP address, institution identification number (e.g. student ID) or government-issued identification number (e.g. Social Security Number);
Contact information
, such as email address, postal address, telephone number;
Demographic information
, such as age or gender;
Commercial information

Images
, such as closed-circuit television if visiting our office locations;
Website activity information
, as explained below in the section “Information Collected Through Automated Technologies;”
Preferences
,
such as communication, language, or marketing.
Some of the personal information that we process may constitute sensitive personal information, which can be defined differently according to each country’s local data protection laws.  We will only process such sensitive personal information where this is necessary to fulfil a specific and legitimate purpose.
2. Where we collect personal information from
Information provided directly
We collect personal information directly from individuals who use our Sites or services, visit our office locations, or communicate with us. All information that we ask for is mandatory unless it is indicated as being optional. If mandatory information is not provided, we will be unable to provide the requested service.
Information collected through automated technologies
We collect personal information when our Sites are used, either directly or through our third-party analytics providers. This might include Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, device identifier details, internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, the Site content interacted with, operating system, clickstream data, location data, or other usage information. We collect this information through tracking technologies, including first and third-party cookies, web beacons (also known as tracking pixels or pixel tags), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device recognition technologies, and session replay software. We may combine this information with other information that we hold.
We use this information to enable Site functionality, understand Site interaction trends, gather demographic insights about our user base, personalize user experiences, and otherwise administer and improve our Sites and services. While we do not currently respond to “do not track” browser signals, users have several options to exercise choices about cookies and tracking technologies. Our Cookies Policy provides more information about cookies and tracking technologies on our Sites and how to control their use.
Information we receive from other sources
We receive personal information from third parties such as: business partners that we work with to provide our services; advertising, marketing, digital and social media agencies; data brokers; analytics providers; academic institutions; journal owners, societies and similar organizations; search information providers; third parties who may recommend potential authors, reviewers, editors or contributors; and credit reference agencies. We also receive information from publicly accessible sources, such as public databases or social media platforms.
If you choose to register and sign in by using a third-party account as an identity service (such as your Facebook or Google account), that third party manages the authentication of your account. Wiley will collect your name, email address and any other information that you agree to share with us at the time you give permission for your Wiley account to be linked to your third-party account.
3.
Use of personal information
Depending on how individuals interact with Wiley, we use personal information where it is necessary to perform contractual obligations, where consent has been given, where it is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or (if permitted by jurisdictional law) where we or a third party have a legitimate and lawful business need.  This includes processing personal information for the following purposes:
Administration of products and services
Performing contracts or other transactions that we enter into;
Providing, managing and supporting our products and services.
Marketing and communication
Communicating about our or our partners’ programs or events (including webinars, conferences, contests, or surveys);
Marketing our Sites, products, or services (including by delivering commercial emails, newsletters, targeted advertising, phone calls, and/or SMS messages);
Responding to enquiries, requests, or other comments;
Personalizing our Sites, services, products, and communications.
Development of products and services
Evaluating and improving our business (including enhancing our Sites, services, products, and communications; developing new Sites, services, and products; and assessing the effectiveness of our promotions and advertising);
Performing data analytics for internal research or other business purposes.
Business management and administration
Diversity and inclusion initiatives (for example, we might use gender to analyze representation and improve equitable outcomes);
Detecting and investigating fraud and suspicious activity (e.g., violations of our
Terms of Use
) and otherwise keeping our Sites safe and secure;
Complying with legal or regulatory obligations.
We use information collected through automated technologies for the purposes described in the “Information Collected Through Automated Technologies” section above.
Wiley does not use solely automated means to produce decisions that would have legal or similarly significant effects on individuals without providing the opportunity for human review. If such decisions are made in any particular instance, we will provide information about how the decision is made, the consequences of the decision, and how to ask for that automated decision to be reviewed by a person.
We may use personal information for other purposes that we inform you of where we have prior consent, a legitimate business interest, or another lawful basis to do so.
We may aggregate or anonymise information so that it is de-identified and can no longer be used to identify individuals. Subject to applicable laws, this information may be used for analytical purposes such as developing our products and services, identifying industry trends, and benchmarking. Where allowed by law, we may share aggregated or de-identified information with third parties as described in the “Sharing Personal Information” section below.
4.
Sharing personal information

2. Processing of personal information
The
Wiley Privacy Policy
explains the types of personal information that we collect and process, the purposes for that collection and processing, the sources of that personal information, and how long it is retained for.  The precise data elements and processing purposes will depend on the particular service or product that Wiley is asked to provide, so not all that information will apply to every individual.
The CCPA categories of personal information that we have collected in the previous 12 months, are shown in the table below.
Category
Examples
Identifiers
Real name, online identifier, IP address, email address, unique personal identifiers

Sensitive personal information

CCPA provides consumers with a right to limit a business’s use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information to certain purposes specified by law. Wiley only uses sensitive personal information for those purposes, so we do not provide an opt-out mechanism for exercising this right.
The CCPA categories of sensitive personal information that we have collected in the previous 12 months are shown in the table below.
Category
Examples
Social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number

5.
Sharing personal information for cross-contextual advertising
In some circumstances, information about users’ interactions with our websites may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes. This information is collected and shared using website cookies. The categories of personal information collected for this purpose include identifiers (e.g. IP address) and internet activity information.
You can opt-out of the use of cookies for advertising purposes by setting your preferences via the cookie banner on our websites.
6.
Disclosing personal information for business purposes
We may disclose personal information to third parties for our operational business purposes, such as auditors, payment service providers, or other companies who perform services on our behalf. We may also disclose information with certain partner organizations, for example where an academic institution provides you with access to a Wiley service. These categories of third parties are explained in the
Wiley Privacy Policy
at section 4. Any categories of personal information that we hold, as listed in section 2 above, may be disclosed for these business purposes.
