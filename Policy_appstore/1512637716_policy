On mobile platforms new DivTracker app accounts are created anonymously without requiring email
		addresses or passwords. Users have the option to create accounts with email and password, and

		completely without any information provided by you, other than holdings you decide to add in the
		app at your own discretion.

		layer of security. The account allows for data storage on our secure servers. Users can delete
		their accounts at any time within the app, giving them control over their stored information.

		accomplish DivTracker's functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside
		parties at any time for any reason.

		requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate,
		prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such
		transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
