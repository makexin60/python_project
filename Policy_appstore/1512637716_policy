Your privacy is important to us. It is Lemon Squeezy’s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, www.lemonsqueezy.com, and other sites we own and operate.
Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online service.
In the event our site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our site.
This policy is effective as of 1 June 2021.
Last updated: 1 June 2021

Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.
Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.
Device Data
When you visit our website or interact with our services, we may automatically collect data about your device, such as:

Data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn what information they make available to us.

First, Some Background
A quick note about Plaid
Our mission at Plaid is to unlock financial freedom for everyone. Plaid helps consumers like you connect your financial accounts to Plaid or to third-party developers in order to provide you with products and services that you request.
About this Policy
Our goal with this Policy is to provide a simple and straightforward explanation of what data Plaid collects from and about you and how we use and share that information. We value transparency and want to provide you with a clear and concise description of how we treat your data.
This Policy does not cover what developers of the apps you use do with your data. You should review the privacy policies or terms of service for those apps for information about their practices. This Policy also does not cover data we collect through our websites or when you interact with Plaid outside of using our product or services, such as emailing Plaid directly. Please see our
All Audience Privacy Statement
and
Cookie Policy
for more information.
Plaid’s services are not directed to individuals under 18 and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.
Our Data Practices
Plaid is committed to providing end users with meaningful control over their data. This section describes Plaid’s data practices relating to our processing of data about you. We also provide summaries of our practices organized by category of data collected and by product at the end of this Policy in the
Summaries of Processing Activities
section.
Data We Collect and Categories of Sources
As described in more detail below, the data we collect, use, and share depends on the Plaid products and services that you, and/or the app you have connected to, use. Depending on which of Plaid’s products or services you or your app use, Plaid may collect the following:
Data you provide to us;
Data from financial institutions when you connect your financial account;
Data from the electronic device you use to connect your financial account using Plaid or to otherwise interact with Plaid;
Data from the developer of the app you have connected to;
Data from our affiliates to provide support to you or to provide you with a better user experience; and/or
Data from other sources, including service providers and identity verification and fraud prevention services.
Data you provide to us.
When you use Plaid’s products or services (like when you use Plaid to connect your financial accounts to an app), we collect the following data from you as needed to power your particular app or Plaid product or service:
identifiers
like name, email address, date of birth, Social Security number, and phone number;
login data
when required by the provider of your account, like your username and password, account and routing number, or a security token;
any additional information needed to connect your accounts,
including security questions and answers, and one-time password (OTP);
information from
documents or statements
that you provide to Plaid, like bank statements or pay stubs; and/or
information related to
your use of our services
, including which of our services you use, the dates and times of your use, and which financial institutions and apps you connect using Plaid.
When you provide login data and additional information needed to connect your accounts, you also give Plaid permission and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit data to and from your financial institution.
Data we collect from financial institutions about and from your accounts.
Depending on which Plaid products or services you, or the developer of your app use, as well as what, and how information is made available, we may collect the following data from your financial institutions:
Account data
, including financial institution name, account name, account type, account ownership, branch number, IBAN, BIC, account number, routing number, and sort code;
Data about an account balance
, including current and available balance;
Data about credit accounts
, including due dates, balances owed, payment amounts and dates, transaction history, credit limit, repayment status, and interest rate;
Data about loan accounts
, including due dates, repayment status, balances, payment amounts and dates, interest rate, guarantor, loan type, payment plan, and terms;
Data about investment accounts
, including transaction information, type of asset, identifying details about the asset, quantity, price, fees, and cost basis;
Identifiers
and data about the account owner(s), including name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and address information;
Data about account transactions
, including amount, date, payee, type, quantity, price, location, involved securities, and a description of the transaction; and/or
Data from your payroll and tax documents
, including data about your income and employer, in cases where you’ve connected your payroll accounts or provided us with your pay stub or tax form information.
Depending on the Plaid service you or the developer of your app use, and the manner in which the data is made available, the data collected from your financial accounts may include data from all accounts (e.g., checking, savings, credit card, and joint accounts) accessible through a single set of account credentials. For more specifics about data collected in connection with different products and services, see
Summary of Processing Activities by Product
.
Data we receive from your devices.
When you use a device, like your smartphone, tablet, or computer, to interact with our services (including through a developer’s app), we may collect the following data about that device:
internet protocol (IP) address;
timezone setting and location, device location;
hardware model and operating system;
features within our services you access;
browser data;
network data; and
other technical data about the device (such as settings and preferences).
Data we receive about you from the developers of apps powered by Plaid.
When needed for Plaid to provide a service (like verifying your identity, protecting against fraud or risk, or enabling a bank transfer), the developers of the apps you use may provide us with identifiers and commercial information about you, like your name, Social Security number, email address, phone number, or information about your financial accounts and transactions.
Data from our affiliates to provide support to you or to provide you with a better user experience.
We may collect data from our affiliates (these are companies related to us by common ownership or control) to provide support to you or improve your experience. For example, if you elect for Plaid CRA to remember financial accounts associated with your phone number, we may collect the following data from Plaid CRA in order to help you connect to your accounts faster when using our services:
identifiers
like name, email address, and phone number;
login data
when required by the provider of your account, like your username and password, bank name, account and routing number, or a security token;
when needed,
data to help verify your identity and connect your accounts,
including your date of birth, security questions and answers, and one-time password (OTP); and/or
data from your device (as explained in more detail above).
Data we receive about you from other sources.
When needed to provide a service, identify your device, or to help prevent fraud, abuse, or security threats, we may also receive data about you directly from third parties, including your wireless carrier, agents and our service providers.
Information we derive from the data we collect.
We may derive additional information about you from the data we collect. For example, we may infer your geolocation, your annual income, or the type of account or subaccount you’ve chosen to connect―such as when you connect your loan accounts, so we can let the developer know whether the account is for a mortgage, student loan, or credit card.

This includes creating or using aggregated or anonymized data to develop new products or services, to facilitate research, and for analytics purposes to help assess the speed, accuracy, and/or security of our services.
Our Lawful Bases for Processing (EEA and UK End Users)
For individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), Plaid only processes your personal data when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Our legal basis for processing the data we collect will depend on what data we collected and the purpose for processing it. Generally, we will only collect and process your data where:
we are bound by any contract or agreement with you (for example, to comply with our end user services agreements) and must adhere to various legal requirements when offering regulated services, including our account information and payment services.
we require your data to comply with our legal obligations under applicable law, to safeguard Plaid's legal rights, and to prevent and identify criminal activities such as money laundering and fraud. For these purposes, Plaid may find it necessary to share your personal data with entities such as courts, law enforcement agencies, and providers of anti-money laundering services;
processing is necessary for our legitimate interests to effectively maintain the integrity of our services. This includes retrieving account information or providing payment initiation services (as well as verifying the output of this activity), engaging in communication with you, and ensuring that Plaid, as a regulated entity, upholds the expected standards (including those stipulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for Plaid Financial Ltd and De Nederlandsche Bank for Plaid B.V).; or
you have given your consent to do so.
To the extent we rely on consent to collect and process your data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time per the instructions provided in this Policy.
How We Share Your Data
We share your data for the following reasons:
With the developer of the app you are using and as directed by that developer;
To enforce any contract with you;
With our data processors and other service providers, partners, agents or contractors in connection with the services they perform for us or developers;
With financial institutions to help establish, maintain, or manage a connection you’ve chosen to make between your financial institution accounts and the products or services you use, as well as to help them protect your financial accounts and offer you personalized services such as returning user experiences;
If we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process (like a court order or subpoena);
In connection with a change in ownership or control of all or a part of our business (like a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or bankruptcy);
Between and among Plaid and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control or ownership;
As we believe reasonably appropriate to protect against and prevent actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims, other liabilities, or otherwise protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of you, developers, our partners, Plaid, and others; or
For any other notified purpose with your consent or at your direction.
(For US users) We do not share your data with non-affiliated third parties except as permitted by law (as authorized by 12 C.F.R. § 1016.14 and 1016.15).
When you link your financial accounts through Plaid, we typically use Google’s reCAPTCHA service to help detect fraud and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA is integrated into Plaid products and services in order to ensure that entries made in online forms, for example, are actually made by real persons and are not automated by software (or bots).
Google reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of users of our products and services using different characteristics. Google reCAPTCHA processes personal data such as your IP address, your length of stay on our website and further information about your use of Plaid products and services. This data will be transmitted and stored by Google on servers in the United States and other countries. Google has certified with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework; the certificate is available
here
. When reCAPTCHA is used,
Google’s Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Use
apply to reCAPTCHA and information Google collects through reCAPTCHA.
We only share your personal financial data with third parties to power the services you requested, when you consent, and/or to protect against fraud.
We may collect and share cookie data with third parties when you visit our website, or we may allow third parties to collect this cookie data from our sites. Please see our
Cookie Policy
and
All Audience Privacy Statement
for more details.
Our Retention and Deletion Practices
We retain your data only as long as it is needed. To determine whether the data is needed, we consider the reason your data was collected and used and any legal requirements to hold onto your data. We review your data periodically to ensure it is still needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or any other legal requirements. If a developer removes your connection from their app to your data, Plaid’s systems are designed to automatically delete your personal data, subject to certain exceptions where we may still retain your information.
The exceptions to this may be if: (a) you’ve established a connection with another developer’s app through Plaid that is still active; (b) Plaid needs your data to continue providing you with a Plaid product or service you requested; (c) Plaid is required by law to keep your data; (d) Plaid needs your data to help protect against or prevent fraud or protect privacy, provide support, or investigate misuse and misconduct; (e) Plaid has anonymized your data such that it cannot be reidentified; or (f) we request - and you specifically agree - to allow us to retain your data longer.
Your data will only be processed as required by law or in accordance with this Policy.
Please refer to the
“Your Data Protection Rights”
section of this Policy for options that may be available to you, including how to request deletion of your data. The
“Your Additional Privacy Controls”
section of this Policy also provides details about tools available to you to help you view and manage the connections you’ve made using Plaid. You can also contact us about our data retention practices using the contact information in the
“Contacting Plaid”
section below.
Protection of Data
Plaid’s security policies and practices are designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data. Plaid implements controls designed to limit access to this data to personnel who have a business reason to know it and prohibits its personnel from unlawfully accessing, using or disclosing this data.
Some Final Details
International Data Transfers
We operate internationally, and so we transfer the data we collect about you across international borders for processing and storage (for example, we transfer data from the EEA and UK to the United States and store data in AWS regions located in the United States). When we transfer data to a different country or territory, we follow applicable data protection laws in doing so. In particular, when we transfer data from the EEA or UK across other international borders, we rely on adequacy decisions, data transfer agreements, or other EU Commission- or UK Secretary of State-approved (as applicable) mechanisms for such transfers, including standard contractual clauses. You can ask for a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out below. Prior to transferring data from the EEA or UK, we carry out transfer impact assessments and implement any supplementary measures to ensure any data transferred will be maintained in accordance with EEA and UK requirements.
Your Data Protection Rights
Regardless of where you live, we will honor the following rights related to your personal data, subject to some limitations and exceptions provided by law, and you will not be discriminated against for exercising them:
Access data collected about you;
Request access to more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we may have collected about you in the last 12 months (including personal information disclosed for business purposes);
Request, under certain circumstances, that we rectify or update your data that is inaccurate or incomplete;
Request, under certain circumstances, that we erase or restrict the processing of your data;
Object to our processing of your data under certain conditions provided by law;
Where processing of your data is based on consent, withdraw that consent;
Request that we provide data collected about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can transfer it to another company, where technically feasible.
Please note that for an official record of your financial information you should make that request directly to your financial institution.
Depending on where you live, you may have the right to lodge a complaint. We welcome and appreciate the chance to address any concerns you may have and encourage you to contact us. In addition, and depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make a complaint at any time to your (data protection) supervisory authority. For end users in the EEA, you can find contact information for the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on the EDPB’s website
here
. For end users in the UK, you can find contact information for the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on the ICO’s website
here
. For end users in Switzerland this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner which you can find
here
.
To exercise any rights you have, you can submit a request using our
online form
. You can also contact us as described in the “Contacting Plaid” section below to exercise any of your data protection rights. You may be required to provide additional information necessary to confirm your identity before we can respond to your request.
If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that the agent has valid written authority, like a power of attorney, to submit requests on your behalf.
We will consider requests and provide our response within a reasonable period of time (and within any time period required by applicable law). Please note, however, that certain data may be exempt from such requests, for example if we need to keep the data to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Your Additional Privacy Controls
Plaid developed the
Plaid Portal
to provide you with a convenient, centralized way to view and manage the connections you’ve made using Plaid.
If you’re located in the U.S., you can sign up for Plaid Portal by visiting my.plaid.com, verifying your phone number and email address, and creating a password. Once you’ve signed up for Plaid Portal, you’ll be directed to a dashboard that can show you financial accounts you’ve connected to your chosen apps using Plaid, and the types of data shared with those apps. Additionally, the Plaid Portal provides you with controls to terminate the connection between apps and your financial accounts and delete associated data stored in Plaid’s systems.
Changes To This Policy
We update or change this Policy from time to time. If we make any updates or changes, we will post the new policy on Plaid’s website at
https://plaid.com/legal
and update the effective date at the top of this Policy. We will also notify developers of any material changes in accordance with our developer agreements, as they may be better positioned to notify you about changes to this Policy. If you are an active user of Plaid Portal, we will also send you an email notifying you of the update.

Summary of Processing Activities by Product
As noted above, the data we collect and use depends on the Plaid products and services that you and the developer use. To make it easier to understand what data is collected and used for which product and service, we put together the below summaries of our data collection and use by product. Some of these products are only available to US based users, and others are only available to EEA and UK based users. If you are not sure which Plaid products or services your connected applications use, please contact the developer of the application. (Note that this list reflects Plaid’s product suite as of the effective date of this Policy and may not include products or services in development as of that date.)
Additionally, data protection law in certain jurisdictions, such as the UK and EU, differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of data. Depending on which product or service you and your developer are using, Plaid may be the controller or the processor of the data collected under the relevant data protection law. Unless otherwise specified in the product description below, Plaid is the controller of the personal data collected.

Pour les personnes situées dans l’Espace économique européen (« EEE ») ou le Royaume-Uni, Plaid traite uniquement vos données personnelles lorsque nous pouvons nous appuyer sur une base juridique à cette fin. La base juridique sur laquelle nous nous appuyons pour traiter les données que nous recueillons dépendra des données que nous avons recueillies et de la finalité de leur traitement.

dans le cas d’une modification de propriété ou de contrôle de tout ou partie de notre activité (telle qu’une fusion, acquisition, réorganisation ou faillite) ;

à toute autre fin déclarée, avec votre consentement ou selon vos instructions.

Nous examinons régulièrement vos données pour veiller à ce qu’elles soient toujours nécessaires pour réaliser la finalité pour laquelle elles ont été collectées, ou pour satisfaire à toute autre exigence légale. Si un développeur supprime votre connexion entre son appli et vos données, les systèmes de Plaid sont conçus pour supprimer automatiquement vos données personnelles, hormis certaines exceptions où nous pourrions conserver vos informations.

Vos données ne seront traitées que selon les exigences de la loi ou conformément à la présente Politique.
Veuillez vous référer à la section relative à « Vos droits à la protection de vos données » pour les options qui sont mises à votre disposition, y compris la façon de demander la suppression de vos données. La section « Vos contrôles en matière de vie privée » dans cette Politique contient également des informations sur les outils à votre disposition pour consulter et gérer les connexions que vous avez établies via Plaid.

Nuestras bases legitimadoras para el tratamiento (usuarios finales del EEE y del Reino Unido)
En el caso de las personas que se encuentran en el Espacio Económico Europeo (“EEE”) o en el Reino Unido (“RU”), Plaid únicamente trata sus datos personales cuando tenemos una base legitimadora válida para hacerlo. Nuestra base legitimadora para tratar los datos que recabamos dependerá del tipo de datos que recabemos y del fin para el que los tratamos. En general, solamente recabaremos y trataremos sus datos cuando:
estemos obligados por cualquier contrato o acuerdo con usted (por ejemplo, para cumplir con nuestros acuerdos de servicios del usuario final) y debamos cumplir con diversos requisitos legales al ofrecer servicios regulados, incluidos nuestros servicios de información de cuentas y pagos;
necesitemos sus datos a fin de cumplir con nuestras obligaciones legales en virtud de la ley aplicable, para proteger los derechos legales de Plaid, y para prevenir e identificar actividades delictivas, como el lavado de dinero y el fraude. A tales efectos, Plaid puede considerar que es necesario compartir sus datos personales con entidades como tribunales, fuerzas de seguridad y proveedores de servicios que luchan contra el lavado de dinero;
el tratamiento sea necesario para nuestros intereses legítimos, a fin de mantener la integridad de nuestros servicios de manera efectiva. Esto incluye recuperar información de la cuenta o prestar servicios de iniciación de pagos (así como verificar el resultado de esta actividad), interactuar con usted y garantizar que Plaid, en calidad de entidad regulada, cumpla con las normas previstas (incluidas las estipuladas por la autoridad de conductas financieras [Financial Conduct Authority] con respecto a Plaid Financial Ltd y por De Nederlandsche Bank con respecto a Plaid B. V.); o
usted haya dado su consentimiento para hacerlo.
En la medida en que nos basemos en el consentimiento para recabar y tratar sus datos, usted tiene derecho a retirar su consentimiento en cualquier momento, conforme a las instrucciones proporcionadas en esta Política.
Cómo compartimos sus datos
Compartimos sus datos por las siguientes razones:
con el desarrollador de la aplicación que usted está utilizando y según las indicaciones de dicho desarrollador;
para el cumplimiento de cualquier contrato con usted;
con nuestros encargados del tratamiento de datos y otros proveedores de servicios, socios o contratistas en relación con los servicios que nos prestan a nosotros o a los desarrolladores;
con instituciones financieras, para ayudar a establecer, mantener y administrar una conexión que usted haya elegido hacer entre las cuentas de su institución financiera y una aplicación;
cuando consideremos de buena fe que la divulgación es apropiada para cumplir con la normativa y legislación aplicables o con un proceso legal (por ejemplo, una orden o citación judicial);
en relación con un cambio de titularidad o control de la totalidad o parte de nuestra empresa (por ejemplo, una fusión, adquisición, reestructuración o quiebra);
entre Plaid y nuestras matrices, empresas afiliadas y otras empresas con titularidad o control compartidos presentes y futuras;
en la medida en que lo consideremos razonablemente apropiado, para evitar actividades maliciosas o fraudulentas, proteger los derechos, la privacidad, la seguridad o los bienes suyos, de los desarrolladores, de nuestros socios, de Plaid y de otros; o
para cualquier otro fin notificado, con su consentimiento o según sus instrucciones.
(Para usuarios de los EE. UU.) No compartimos sus datos con terceros no afiliados, salvo en casos permitidos por ley (según se autoriza en el Código de Regulaciones Federales [Code of Federal Regulations, CFR], título 12, arts. 1016.14 y 1016.15).
Cuando vincula sus cuentas financieras a través de Plaid, normalmente usamos el servicio reCAPTCHA de Google para ayudar a detectar fraudes y abusos. reCAPTCHA de Google está integrado en los productos y servicios de Plaid para garantizar que los datos ingresados en formularios en línea, por ejemplo, sean realmente realizados por personas reales y no de manera automatizada por software (o bots).
reCAPTCHA de Google analiza el comportamiento de los usuarios de nuestros productos y servicios mediante diferentes características. reCAPTCHA de Google trata datos personales, como su dirección IP, el tiempo que permanece en nuestro sitio web y demás información sobre el uso que usted hace de los productos y servicios de Plaid. Google transmitirá y almacenará dichos datos en servidores que se encuentran en los Estados Unidos y en otros países. Google ha obtenido la certificación del Marco de Privacidad de Datos entre la UE y los EE. UU. (EU-US Data Privacy Framework); el certificado se encuentra disponible
aquí
. Cuando usamos reCAPTCHA, se aplican la Política de privacidad y las Condiciones de uso de Google a reCAPTCHA y a la información que Google recaba mediante reCAPTCHA.
Únicamente compartimos sus datos financieros personales con terceros para potenciar los servicios que solicitó, cuando usted brinda su consentimiento o a fin de protegerlo contra fraudes.
Podemos recabar y compartir datos de cookies con terceros cuando usted visita nuestro sitio web, o podemos permitir que terceros recaben estos datos de cookies a partir de nuestros sitios. Le recomendamos que consulte la
Política de cookies
y la
Política de privacidad para todos los públicos
si desea conocer más detalles.
Nuestras prácticas de conservación y eliminación
Conservamos sus datos solamente mientras sea necesario. Para determinar si los datos son necesarios, consideramos la razón por la cual se recabaron y utilizaron sus datos, y los requisitos legales para conservarlos. Revisamos sus datos de forma periódica para asegurarnos de que siguen siendo necesarios para cumplir con el fin para el que fueron recabados o para cualquier otro requisito legal. Si un desarrollador elimina la conexión que usted tiene desde la aplicación de este a sus datos, los sistemas de Plaid están diseñados para eliminar sus datos personales de forma automática, salvo determinadas excepciones en las que podremos conservar su información.
Las excepciones pueden ser: (a) si usted estableció una conexión con la aplicación de otro desarrollador a través de Plaid que sigue activa; (b) si Plaid necesita sus datos para seguir brindándole un servicio de Plaid que usted solicitó; (c) si por ley Plaid debe conservar sus datos; (d) si Plaid necesita sus datos para ayudar a prevenir el fraude o proteger la privacidad, brindar soporte o investigar el uso o la conducta indebidos; (e) cuando Plaid haya anonimizado sus datos, de modo que no puedan volver a permitir la identificación; o (f) si le solicitamos que nos permita conservar sus datos por más tiempo y usted específicamente lo acepta.
Sus datos únicamente serán tratados según lo exija la ley o de conformidad con esta Política.
Le recomendamos que consulte la sección “Sus derechos en materia de protección de datos” de esta Política para conocer las opciones que puedan estar disponibles para usted, lo que incluye cómo solicitar la eliminación de sus datos. En la sección “Sus controles de su privacidad” de esta Política también se brindan detalles sobre las herramientas que tiene a su disposición, para ayudarlo a visualizar y administrar las conexiones que ha realizado a través de Plaid. También puede contactarnos en relación con nuestras prácticas de conservación de datos, usando la información de contacto en la sección “Cómo ponerse en contacto con Plaid”, más adelante.
Protección de datos
Las políticas y prácticas de seguridad de Plaid están diseñadas para proteger la confidencialidad e integridad de sus datos. Plaid implementa controles creados para limitar el acceso a estos datos al personal que tiene un motivo comercial para conocerlos, y prohíbe al personal acceder a estos datos, divulgarlos o utilizarlos ilícitamente.
Algunos detalles finales
Transferencias internacionales de datos
Operamos a nivel internacional y, por consiguiente, transferimos los datos que recabamos acerca de usted a través de fronteras internacionales para el tratamiento y almacenamiento (por ejemplo, transferimos datos desde el EEE y el RU a los Estados Unidos, y almacenamos datos en regiones de AWS ubicadas en los Estados Unidos). Al transferir datos a un país o territorio diferente, respetamos las leyes aplicables sobre protección de datos. En particular, cuando transferimos datos desde el EEE o el RU a través de otras fronteras internacionales, nos basamos en las decisiones de adecuación, acuerdos sobre transferencia de datos u otros mecanismos aprobados por la Comisión Europea o la Secretaría de Estado del Reino Unido (según corresponda) para dichas transferencias, incluidas las cláusulas contractuales tipo. Puede solicitar una copia de esas cláusulas contractuales tipo contactándonos según se indica debajo. Antes de transferir datos desde el EEE o el RU, realizamos evaluaciones del impacto de las transferencias e implementamos las medidas complementarias necesarias para garantizar que los datos transferidos sean conservados de conformidad con los requisitos impuestos por el EEE y el RU.

retirar ese consentimiento cuando el tratamiento de sus datos se base en su consentimiento;

Resumen de las actividades de tratamiento por producto
Como se mencionó anteriormente, los datos que recabamos y usamos dependen de los productos y servicios de Plaid que usted y el desarrollador usan. Para facilitar la comprensión de qué datos se recaban y usan para cada producto y servicio, hemos elaborado los siguientes resúmenes sobre nuestra recopilación y uso de datos por producto. Algunos de estos productos únicamente están disponibles para los usuarios que se encuentran en los EE. UU. y otros solamente para usuarios que se encuentran en el EEE y el RU. Si no está seguro de cuáles productos o servicios de Plaid usan las aplicaciones a las que está conectado, le solicitamos que se comunique con el desarrollador de la aplicación. (Tenga en cuenta que esta lista refleja el conjunto de productos de Plaid a partir de la fecha de entrada en vigencia de esta Política y podría no incluir productos o servicios en desarrollo a partir de esa fecha).
Además, la ley de protección de datos de algunas jurisdicciones, como el Reino Unido y la UE, diferencia entre el “responsable de controlar el tratamiento” y el “encargado del tratamiento” de los datos. En función del producto o servicio que usted y su desarrollador utilicen, Plaid puede ser el responsable de controlar el tratamiento o el encargado del tratamiento de los datos recabados en virtud de la ley de protección de datos pertinente. A menos que se especifique lo contrario en la descripción del producto a continuación, Plaid es el responsable de controlar el tratamiento de los datos personales recabados.

Gegevens van onze gelieerde ondernemingen om u ondersteuning te bieden of om u een betere gebruikerservaring te bieden.
We kunnen gegevens verzamelen van onze gelieerde ondernemingen (dit zijn bedrijven die met ons verbonden zijn door gemeenschappelijk eigendom of zeggenschap) om u ondersteuning te bieden of uw ervaring te verbeteren.

Onze rechtsgrondslag voor het verwerken van de gegevens die we verzamelen, is afhankelijk van welke gegevens we hebben verzameld en het doel van de verwerking. In het algemeen zullen wij uw gegevens alleen verzamelen en verwerken wanneer:
wij moeten voldoen aan een contract of overeenkomst met u (bijvoorbeeld om te voldoen aan onze overeenkomsten voor eindgebruikersdiensten) en moeten ons houden aan verschillende wettelijke voorschriften bij het aanbieden van gereguleerde diensten, waaronder onze rekeninginformatie en betalingsdiensten.
we uw gegevens nodig hebben om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen onder de toepasselijke wetgeving, om de wettelijke rechten van Plaid te waarborgen en om criminele activiteiten zoals het witwassen van geld en fraude te voorkomen en te identificeren. Voor deze doeleinden kan Plaid het noodzakelijk vinden om uw persoonsgegevens te delen met entiteiten zoals rechtbanken, wetshandhavingsinstanties en aanbieders van antiwitwasdiensten;
verwerking is noodzakelijk voor onze legitieme belangen om de integriteit van onze diensten effectief te handhaven. Dit omvat het ophalen van rekeninginformatie of het verlenen van betalingsinitiatiediensten (evenals het verifiëren van de output van deze activiteit), het aangaan van communicatie met u en het ervoor zorgen dat Plaid, als een gereglementeerde entiteit, de verwachte normen naleeft (waaronder die zijn vastgelegd door de Financial Conduct Authority voor Plaid Financial Ltd en De Nederlandsche Bank voor Plaid B.V); of
u hiervoor uw toestemming hebt gegeven.
Voor zover wij vertrouwen op toestemming om uw gegevens te verzamelen en te verwerken, hebt u het recht om uw toestemming op elk gewenst moment in te trekken volgens de instructies in dit Beleid.
Hoe we uw gegevens delen
We delen uw gegevens om de volgende redenen:
Met de ontwikkelaar van de app die u gebruikt en zoals aangegeven door die ontwikkelaar;
Om een contract met u uit te voeren;
Met onze gegevensverwerkers en andere dienstverleners, partners, agenten of contractanten in verband met de diensten die zij voor ons of voor ontwikkelaars uitvoeren;
Met financiële instellingen om een koppeling die u hebt gekozen tussen uw rekeningen bij een financiële instelling en een app tot stand te brengen, te onderhouden of te beheren;
Als wij in goed vertrouwen geloven dat openbaarmaking gepast is om te voldoen aan de toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of een juridisch proces (zoals een gerechtelijk bevel of dagvaarding);
In verband met een verandering in eigenaarschap of controle van ons bedrijf of een deel ervan (zoals een fusie, overname, reorganisatie of faillissement);
Tussen en binnen Plaid en onze huidige en toekomstige moedermaatschappijen, gelieerde bedrijven, dochterondernemingen en andere bedrijven onder gemeenschappelijke controle of eigenaarschap;
Zoals wij redelijkerwijs passend achten om kwaadwillige of frauduleuze activiteiten te voorkomen, of op andere wijze de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendommen van u, ontwikkelaars, onze partners, Plaid en anderen te beschermen; of
Voor elk ander aangemeld doel met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing.
(Voor gebruikers in de VS) Wij delen uw gegevens niet met niet-gelieerde derden, tenzij dit wettelijk is toegestaan (zoals toegestaan door 12 C.F.R. § 1016.14 en 1016.15).
Wanneer u uw financiële rekeningen koppelt via Plaid, gebruiken we doorgaans de reCaptcha-dienst van Google om fraude en misbruik te helpen detecteren. Google reCAPTCHA is geïntegreerd in de producten en diensten van Plaid om ervoor te zorgen dat invoer in bijvoorbeeld online formulieren daadwerkelijk door echte personen wordt gedaan en niet door geautomatiseerde software (of bots).
Google reCAPTCHA analyseert het gedrag van gebruikers van onze producten en services aan de hand van verschillende kenmerken. Google reCAPTCHA verwerkt persoonsgegevens zoals uw IP-adres, uw verblijfsduur op onze website en verdere informatie over uw gebruik van de producten en diensten van Plaid. Deze gegevens worden door Google verzonden en opgeslagen op servers in de Verenigde Staten en andere landen. Google heeft zich gecertificeerd voor het EU-VS Data Privacy Framework; het certificaat is

beschikbaar. Wanneer reCAPTCHA wordt gebruikt, zijn het Privacybeleid en de Gebruiksvoorwaarden van Google van toepassing op reCAPTCHA en informatie die Google verzamelt via reCAPTCHA.
We delen uw persoonlijke financiële gegevens alleen met derden om de door u gevraagde diensten te ondersteunen, wanneer u toestemming geeft en/of ter bescherming tegen fraude.
We kunnen cookiegegevens verzamelen en delen met derden wanneer u onze website bezoekt, of we kunnen derden toestaan om deze cookiegegevens van onze websites te verzamelen. Raadpleeg ons
Cookiebeleid
en het

voor alle doelgroepen voor meer informatie.
Onze bewaar- en verwijderingspraktijken
Wij bewaren uw gegevens alleen zo lang als nodig is. Om te bepalen of de gegevens nodig zijn, houden we rekening met de reden waarom uw gegevens zijn verzameld en gebruikt en eventuele wettelijke voorschriften om uw gegevens te bewaren. We beoordelen uw gegevens periodiek om ervoor te zorgen dat ze nog steeds nodig zijn om te voldoen aan het doel waarvoor ze zijn verzameld of aan andere wettelijke verplichtingen. Als een ontwikkelaar uw verbinding van hun app met uw gegevens verwijdert, zijn de systemen van Plaid ontworpen om uw persoonsgegevens automatisch te verwijderen, behoudens bepaalde uitzonderingen waar we uw informatie nog steeds kunnen bewaren.
Uitzonderingen hierop kunnen zijn als: (a) u via Plaid een verbinding met de app van een andere ontwikkelaar tot stand hebt gebracht die nog steeds actief is; (b) Plaid uw gegevens nodig heeft om u te blijven voorzien van een dienst van Plaid die u hebt aangevraagd; (c) Plaid wettelijk verplicht is om uw gegevens te bewaren; (d) Plaid uw gegevens nodig heeft om fraude te helpen voorkomen of de privacy te beschermen, ondersteuning te bieden of misbruik en wangedrag te onderzoeken; (e) Plaid uw gegevens zodanig heeft geanonimiseerd dat ze niet opnieuw geïdentificeerd kunnen worden of (f) wij vragen – en u gaat er specifiek mee akkoord – om ons toe te staan uw gegevens langer te bewaren.
Uw gegevens worden alleen verwerkt zoals voorgeschreven door de wet of in overeenstemming met dit Beleid.
Raadpleeg het gedeelte "Uw rechten voor gegevensbescherming" van dit Beleid voor de opties die voor u beschikbaar kunnen zijn, waaronder hoe u kunt verzoeken om uw gegevens te verwijderen. Het gedeelte "Uw privacybeheer" van dit Beleid bevat ook details over hulpmiddelen die voor u beschikbaar zijn om u te helpen bij het bekijken en beheren van de verbindingen die u met Plaid hebt gemaakt. U kunt ook contact met ons opnemen over onze praktijken voor het bewaren van gegevens met behulp van de contactgegevens in het gedeelte “Contact opnemen met Plaid” hieronder.
Bescherming van gegevens
Het beveiligingsbeleid en de beveiligingspraktijken van Plaid zijn ontworpen om de vertrouwelijkheid en integriteit van uw gegevens te beschermen. Plaid implementeert controles die ontworpen zijn om de toegang tot deze gegevens te beperken tot personeel dat een zakelijke reden heeft om deze gegevens te kennen en verbiedt zijn personeel om deze gegevens op onwettige wijze te openen, te gebruiken of openbaar te maken.
Enkele laatste details
Internationale gegevensoverdrachten
Wij opereren internationaal en daarom geven wij de gegevens die wij over u verzamelen over internationale grenzen door voor verwerking en opslag (wij geven bijvoorbeeld gegevens door van de EER en het VK naar de Verenigde Staten en slaan gegevens op in AWS-regio's in de Verenigde Staten). Wanneer we gegevens doorgeven naar een ander land of gebied volgen we daarbij de toepasselijke wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming. In het bijzonder wanneer we gegevens vanuit de EER of het VK over andere internationale grenzen heen doorgeven, vertrouwen we op adequaatheidsbesluiten, overeenkomsten voor gegevensdoorgifte of andere door de EU-Commissie of de Britse staatssecretaris goedgekeurde (indien van toepassing) mechanismen voor dergelijke doorgiften, waaronder standaard contractuele clausules. U kunt een kopie van genoemde standaardcontractbepalingen aanvragen door contact met ons op te nemen zoals aangegeven onderaan deze Verklaring. Voorafgaand aan de doorgifte van gegevens vanuit de EER of het Verenigd Koninkrijk voeren we effectbeoordelingen uit en implementeren we eventuele aanvullende maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat alle overgedragen gegevens worden bewaard in overeenstemming met de voorschriften van de EER en het Verenigd Koninkrijk.
Uw rechten voor gegevensbescherming
Ongeacht waar u woont, zullen we de volgende rechten met betrekking tot uw persoonsgegevens respecteren, met inachtneming van enkele beperkingen en uitzonderingen die door de wet worden voorzien, en u wordt niet gediscrimineerd voor het uitoefenen ervan:
toegang te krijgen tot gegevens die over u zijn verzameld;
toegang vragen tot meer details over de categorieën en specifieke persoonsgegevens die wij in de afgelopen 12 maanden over u hebben verzameld (inclusief persoonsgegevens die voor zakelijke doeleinden zijn vrijgegeven);
onder bepaalde omstandigheden verzoeken dat wij uw gegevens die onnauwkeurig of onvolledig zijn, corrigeren of bijwerken;
onder bepaalde omstandigheden verzoeken dat wij uw gegevens te wissen of de verwerking ervan beperken;
bezwaar te maken tegen onze verwerking van uw gegevens onder bepaalde voorwaarden die door de wet worden bepaald;
wanneer de verwerking van uw gegevens is gebaseerd op toestemming, dient u die toestemming in te trekken;
verzoeken dat wij de over u verzamelde gegevens verstrekken in een gestructureerd, algemeen gebruikt en machinaal leesbaar formaat, zodat u deze kunt overdragen aan een ander bedrijf, indien dit technisch haalbaar is.
Houd er rekening mee dat u voor een officiële registratie van uw financiële informatie dat verzoek rechtstreeks bij uw financiële instelling moet indienen.
Afhankelijk van waar u woont, hebt u mogelijk het recht om een klacht in te dienen. We verwelkomen en waarderen de kans om eventuele zorgen die u hebt aan te pakken en moedigen u aan om contact met ons op te nemen. Bovendien, en afhankelijk van uw rechtsgebied, kunt u het recht hebben om op elk moment een klacht in te dienen bij uw (gegevensbeschermings-) toezichthoudende autoriteit. Voor eindgebruikers in de EER vindt u de contactgegevens van het Europees Comité voor gegevensbescherming (EDPB) op de website van het EDPB
heir
. Voor eindgebruikers in het Verenigd Koninkrijk vindt u
heir
de contactgegevens van het Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) op de website van het ICO. Voor eindgebruikers in Zwitserland is dit de Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner die u
heir
kunt vinden.
Om rechten uit te oefenen, kunt u een verzoek indienen via ons
online formulier
. U kunt ook contact met ons opnemen zoals beschreven in het gedeelte "Contact opnemen met Plaid" hieronder om uw rechten op het gebied van gegevensbescherming uit te oefenen. Het kan zijn dat u aanvullende gegevens moet verstrekken om uw identiteit te bevestigen voordat wij op uw verzoek kunnen reageren.
Wanneer wij uw verzoek ontvangen van een gevolmachtigde agent, kunnen wij om bewijs vragen dat de agent een geldige schriftelijke machtiging heeft, zoals een volmacht, om namens u verzoeken in te dienen.
We zullen verzoeken in overweging nemen en ons antwoord geven binnen een redelijke termijn (en binnen een door de toepasselijke wetgeving voorgeschreven termijn). Wij wijzen u er echter op dat bepaalde gegevens van dergelijke verzoeken kunnen worden vrijgesteld, bijvoorbeeld als wij de gegevens moeten bewaren om aan onze eigen wettelijke verplichtingen te voldoen of om rechtsvorderingen in te stellen, uit te oefenen of te verdedigen.

Uw extra privacycontroles
Plaid heeft het
Plaid Portal
ontwikkeld om u een handige, gecentraliseerde manier te bieden om de verbindingen die u met Plaid hebt gemaakt te bekijken en te beheren.
Als u in de VS gevestigd bent, dan kunt u een Plaid Portal-account aanmaken door naar my.plaid.com te gaan, uw telefoonnummer en e-mailadres te verifiëren en een wachtwoord aan te maken. Zodra u zich hebt aangemeld voor het Plaid Portal, wordt u naar een dashboard geleid dat u financiële rekeningen kan laten zien die u via Plaid met de door u gekozen apps hebt verbonden, en de soorten gegevens die met die apps worden gedeeld. Bovendien biedt het Plaid Portal u controles om de verbinding tussen apps en uw financiële rekeningen te beëindigen en bijbehorende gegevens die zijn opgeslagen in de systemen van Plaid te verwijderen.

Samenvatting van verwerkingsactiviteiten per product
Zoals hierboven vermeld, zijn de gegevens die we verzamelen en gebruiken afhankelijk van de producten en diensten van Plaid die u en de ontwikkelaar gebruiken. Om het makkelijker te maken om te begrijpen welke gegevens voor welk(e) product en service worden verzameld en gebruikt, hebben we de onderstaande samenvattingen van onze gegevensverzameling en -gebruik per product samengesteld. Sommige van deze producten zijn alleen beschikbaar voor gebruikers in de VS en andere zijn alleen beschikbaar voor gebruikers in de EER en het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Als u niet zeker weet welke Plaid-producten of -diensten uw verbonden toepassingen gebruiken, neem dan contact op met de ontwikkelaar van de toepassing. (Let erop dat deze lijst de productsuite van Plaid weergeeft vanaf de ingangsdatum van dit Beleid en mogelijk geen producten of diensten bevat die op die datum in ontwikkeling zijn.)
Daarnaast maakt de wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming in bepaalde rechtsgebieden, zoals het VK en de EU, onderscheid tussen de “verwerkingsverantwoordelijke” en “verwerker” van gegevens. Afhankelijk van welk(e) product of dienst u en uw ontwikkelaar gebruiken, kan Plaid de verwerkingsverantwoordelijke of de verwerker zijn van de gegevens die zijn verzameld onder de relevante wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming. Tenzij anders vermeld in de onderstaande productbeschrijving, is Plaid de verwerkingsverantwoordelijke van de verzamelde persoonsgegevens.

Für Personen im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR“) oder in Großbritannien („UK“): Plaid verarbeitet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur dann, wenn wir eine gültige Rechtsgrundlage dafür haben. Unsere Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung der von uns erhobenen Daten hängt davon ab, welche Daten wir erhoben haben und welcher Verarbeitungszweck besteht. Grundsätzlich gilt jedoch, dass wir Ihre Daten nur dann erheben und verarbeiten werden, wenn:
Wir sind an jeden Vertrag oder jede Vereinbarung mit Ihnen gebunden (z. B. zur Einhaltung unserer Dienstleistungsvereinbarungen für Endbenutzer) und müssen beim Angebot regulierter Dienstleistungen, einschließlich unserer Kontoinformationen und Zahlungsdienste, verschiedene gesetzliche Vorgaben einhalten.
Wir benötigen Ihre Daten für die Einhaltung unserer gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen nach geltendem Recht, für den Schutz der gesetzlichen Rechte von Plaid und zur Verhinderung und Erkennung von kriminellen Aktivitäten, wie Geldwäsche und Betrug.

Dies betrifft auch das Abrufen von Kontoinformationen oder die Bereitstellung von Zahlungsinitiierungsdiensten (sowie die Überprüfung der Ergebnisse dieser Aktivität), die Kommunikation mit Ihnen und die Maßnahmen, die sicherstellen sollen, dass Plaid als regulierte Körperschaft die erwarteten Standards einhält (einschließlich der von der Financial Conduct Authority (britische Finanzaufsichtsbehörde, FCA) für Plaid Financial Ltd und der De Nederlandsche Bank für Plaid B.V. festgelegten Standards); oder
Sie Ihre Einwilligung erteilt haben.
Soweit wir uns bei der Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten auf Ihre Einwilligung stützen, haben Sie das Recht, diese jederzeit gemäß den in dieser Datenschutzerklärung enthaltenen Prozessen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft zu widerrufen.

Wir geben Ihre Daten aus den folgenden Gründen weiter:
an den Entwickler der von Ihnen genutzten App und gemäß den Anweisungen dieses Entwicklers;
um einen Vertrag mit Ihnen durchzusetzen;
an unsere Datenverarbeiter und andere Dienstleister, Partner oder Auftragnehmer in Verbindung mit Diensten, die sie für uns oder Entwickler erbringen;
mit Finanzinstituten, um eine Verbindung herzustellen, aufrechtzuerhalten oder zu kontrollieren, die Sie zwischen Ihren Finanzinstitutskonten und einer App hergestellt haben;
wenn wir in gutem Glauben überzeugt sind, dass die Offenlegung angemessen ist, um geltendem Recht, Vorschriften oder Verpflichtungen in rechtlichen Verfahren (wie etwa Gerichtsbeschlüsse oder Vorladungen) nachzukommen;
im Zusammenhang mit einer Änderung der Eigentums- oder Beherrschungsverhältnisse in Bezug auf unser gesamtes oder einen Teil unseres Unternehmens (wie etwa Fusion, Übernahme, Umstrukturierung oder Insolvenz);
innerhalb von Plaid sowie an unsere derzeitigen und zukünftigen Muttergesellschaften, verbundenen Unternehmen, Tochtergesellschaften und andere Unternehmen, die unter gemeinsamer Kontrolle oder in gemeinsamem Eigentum stehen;
soweit wir es für angemessen halten, um böswillige bzw. betrügerische Handlungen zu verhindern oder um anderweitig die Rechte, die Privatsphäre, die Sicherheit oder das Eigentum von Ihnen, Entwicklern, unseren Partnern, Plaid und anderen zu schützen; oder
zu anderen vorab mitgeteilten Zwecken auf Basis Ihrer Einwilligung oder auf Ihre Veranlassung.

Wenn Sie Ihre Finanzkonten über Plaid verknüpfen, verwenden wir normalerweise den reCAPTCHA-Dienst von Google, um Betrug und Missbrauch zu erkennen. Google reCAPTCHA ist in Produkte und Dienstleistungen von Plaid integriert.

Datenschutzbestimmungen
und
Nutzungsbedingungen von Google
für reCAPTCHA und die Informationen, die Google mithilfe von reCAPTCHA erhebt.
Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Finanzdaten an Dritte nur für den Betrieb der von Ihnen gewünschten Dienste und Leistungen, wenn Sie zustimmen und/oder um uns und Sie vor Betrug zu schützen, weiter.
Wir können Daten von Cookies erheben und an Dritte weitergeben, wenn Sie unsere Website besuchen, oder wir können Dritten erlauben, diese Daten über unsere Websites zu erheben. Weitere Einzelheiten finden Sie in unserer
Cookie-Richtlinie

Unsere Aufbewahrungs- und Löschpraktiken
Wir bewahren Ihre Daten nur so lange auf, wie diese benötigt werden. Um festzustellen, ob die Daten benötigt werden, prüfen wir den Grund, aus dem Ihre Daten erhoben und verwendet wurden, sowie etwaige gesetzliche Bestimmungen zur Aufbewahrung Ihrer Daten. Wir überprüfen Ihre Daten regelmäßig in Hinblick darauf, ob jene noch für Zweck, für den sie erhoben wurden, oder für andere gesetzliche Erfordernisse benötigt werden. Wenn ein Entwickler Ihre Verbindung in seiner App zu Ihren Daten unterbricht, sind die Systeme von Plaid so konzipiert, dass sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten automatisch löschen. Das geschieht vorbehaltlich bestimmter Ausnahmen, in denen wir Ihre Daten weiterhin aufbewahren können.
Ausgenommen hiervon sind unter Umständen Fälle, in denen: (a) Sie eine Verbindung zu der App eines anderen Entwicklers über Plaid hergestellt haben, die noch aktiv ist; (b) Plaid Ihre Daten zur weiteren Bereitstellung eines von Ihnen angeforderten Plaid-Dienstes benötigt; (c) Plaid gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, Ihre Daten zu speichern; (d) Plaid Ihre Daten zur Verhinderung von Betrug oder zum Schutz der Privatsphäre, zur Leistung von Support oder zur Untersuchung von Missbrauch und Fehlverhalten benötigt, (e) sofern Plaid Ihre Daten anonymisiert hat, sodass eine Re-Identifizierung damit nicht möglich ist, oder (e) wir Sie bitten, uns zu erlauben – und Sie dem ausdrücklich zustimmen –, Ihre Daten länger aufzubewahren.
Ihre Daten werden nur so verarbeitet, wie es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben oder in dieser Erklärung vorgesehen ist.
Bitte lesen Sie den Abschnitt „Ihre Datenschutzrechte“ in dieser Datenschutzerklärung, um sich über die Ihnen zur Verfügung stehenden Möglichkeiten zu informieren, einschließlich zu der Frage, wie die Löschung Ihrer Daten verlangt werden kann. Der Abschnitt „Ihre Datenschutzeinstellungen“ dieser Datenschutzerklärung enthält auch Einzelheiten zu Tools, die Ihnen zur Verfügung stehen, um Verbindungen, die Sie mit Plaid hergestellt haben, anzuzeigen und zu verwalten. Mittels der Kontaktdaten im Abschnitt „Kontaktaufnahme mit Plaid“ können Sie sich auch bezüglich unserer Aufbewahrungs- und Löschpraktiken mit uns in Verbindung setzen.
Schutz der Daten
Die Sicherheitsrichtlinien und -praktiken von Plaid sollen dem Schutz der Vertraulichkeit und Integrität Ihrer Daten dienen. Plaid implementiert Kontrollen, um den Zugang zu diesen Daten auf Mitarbeiter zu beschränken, die einen geschäftlichen Grund zur Kenntnisnahme haben, und untersagt seinen Mitarbeitern jedwede rechtswidrige Zugriffe, Verwendungen oder Weitergaben dieser Daten.
Einige abschließende Hinweise
Internationale Datenübermittlung
Wir sind international tätig, und daher übermitteln wir die Daten, die wir über Sie erheben, über internationale Grenzen hinweg zur Verarbeitung und Speicherung (z. B. übermitteln wir Daten aus dem EWR und Großbritannien in die Vereinigten Staaten und speichern Daten in AWS-Regionen in den Vereinigten Staaten). Wenn wir Daten in ein anderes Land oder Gebiet übermitteln, erfolgt dies stets unter Einhaltung der für uns geltenden Datenschutzgesetze. Insbesondere wenn wir Daten aus dem EWR oder Großbritannien über andere internationale Grenzen übermitteln, stützen wir uns für solche Übermittlungen auf Angemessenheitsentscheidungen, Datenübertragungsvereinbarungen oder andere durch die EU-Kommission oder den britischen Secretary of State (falls zutreffend) genehmigte Mechanismen, einschließlich von Standardvertragsklauseln. Sie können uns über die unten genannten Kanäle kontaktieren, um eine Kopie dieser Standarddatenschutzklauseln zu erhalten. Vor der Übermittlung von Daten aus dem EWR oder auf Großbritannien führen wir Folgenabschätzungen für die Übermittlung durch und ergreifen zusätzliche Maßnahmen, um sicherzustellen, dass alle übermittelten Daten in Übereinstimmung mit den Anforderungen des EWR und des Vereinigten Königreichs aufbewahrt werden.

Account information services

https://my.plaid.com/
) and the Application through which you have accessed our Services.
2.6. To access the Plaid dashboard, you need to create an account with Plaid. You also need to ensure that your information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You must follow best practices to help secure your Plaid account and notify us if you learn of any unauthorised access to or use of your Plaid account.
2.7. With your explicit consent, we access and display information relating to your selected Payment Account(s) ("
Account Information
") within the Plaid dashboard and transmit such information to the Application through which you have accessed our Services. Such information may include: a. financial transaction history, for example, transaction amount, data, description and currency; b. financial account details, for example, account number, type, currency and balance; and c. financial account holder information, for example, name, address, phone number, and email address.
2.8. Before receiving Plaid's account information service, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to retrieve your Account Information using Plaid. Upon such an instruction, you will generally be redirected to us.
2.9. Once you are redirected to us, we will ask you to select which Payment Account provider ("
Account
Provider
") you would like us to access Account Information from. You will give your explicit consent to us: (i) accessing your Account Information from the Account Provider you have selected; and (ii) taking the steps outlined in clause paragraph 2.12. once we have accessed your Account Information. Plaid will request your Account Information from your Account Provider on a periodic basis in accordance with your consent until the consent expires or is withdrawn.
2.10. Please note, you may be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to us accessing your Account Information.
2.11. Alternatively, in some circumstances, we may ask you to provide us with the login details for your Payment Account. By providing us with your Payment Account login details, you confirm that you have all the necessary rights, permissions and authority to share your login details and Account Information with us, and you grant us explicit consent to use your login details to access your Payment Account to obtain the necessary Account Information on your behalf and at your direction in order to provide you with the Services.
2.12. Once we have accessed your Account Information we may: a. share your Account Information with the Application through which you have accessed our Services; b. share your Account Information with third parties as directed by the Application through which you have accessed our Services provided, however, that you have explicitly consent to such sharing; or c. display your Account Information on the Plaid dashboard.
2.13. You agree to us sharing the Account Information we have accessed from your Account Provider with the Application through which you have accessed our Services, and with third parties as directed by that Application provided that in both cases you have explicitly consented to such sharing. Such sharing allows the Application to provide you with products and services in accordance with the Application Terms.
2.14. We do not check the accuracy of the Account Information retrieved from your Account Provider and we rely on your Account Provider to ensure that your Account Information is up to date and accurate.
2.15. We may standardize, categorize, merge, aggregate, and otherwise process your Account Information before displaying your Account Information on the Plaid dashboard, sharing it with the Application through which you have accessed our Services, or sharing it with third parties as directed by that Application with your explicit consent.
2.16. You may withdraw or vary your consent for Plaid to provide account information services at any time.
Payment initiation services
2.17. Plaid's payment initiation service allows you to make online payments from your Payment Account(s). Plaid can initiate the following types of online payments from your Payment Account(s): (i) single payments; (ii) standing orders; and (iii) variable recurring payments.
Single Payments
2.18. Before receiving our payment initiation service in respect of a single online payment order, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to make a single online payment using Plaid. You will be asked to review and confirm your payment order details for the single online payment, including: (i) the payment amount and (ii) the recipient details. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the payment order details are correct before you confirm the payment order. You may not be able to recover a payment to an incorrect account or recipient.
2.19. These details will be pre-populated for you to review and confirm. For example, where you use Plaid payment initiation services to purchase goods or services online you must ensure that the merchant recipient details are correct.
2.20. You will confirm the payment order and provide explicit consent for Plaid to send the payment order to your Account Provider for execution, to receive information from your Account Provider on the initiation and execution of the payment order and to pass this information on to the Application through which you accessed our Services.
2.21. When you use Plaid's payment initiation service you will be asked to select the Payment Account from which you will fund the payment and you may be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to the transaction.
2.22. If the payment order relates to a transaction that is to be executed by your Account Provider immediately, you will not be able to cancel the payment order once you have provided your confirmation and explicit consent in accordance with paragraph 2.20.
2.23. If the Application through which you accessed our Services supports refunds, the following provisions apply: At the time we submit the payment order to your Account Provider for execution, we shall ask the Account Provider to share your name, Payment Account sort code and account number or IBAN ("
Account Details
") with us. If you require a refund for the payment made using Plaid's payment initiation services, you must request the refund from the Application through which you accessed our Services. The Application will in turn notify us that you have requested a refund and we will share your Account Details with the Application in order for them to make the refund to your Payment Account (i.e. the Payment Account used to fund the original payment). The Application (and not Plaid) is responsible for making the refund. Plaid accepts no liability for the accuracy of your Account Details provided to us by your Account Provider.
Standing Orders
2.24. You can use Plaid's payment initiation service to submit a standing order to your Account Provider. A standing order is an instruction to your Account Provider to make regular, recurring payments of the same amount to the same recipient over a specified or indefinite period of time.
2.25. If you use Plaid's payment initiation service to submit a standing order you will be asked to confirm: (i) the amount of the periodic payment, (ii) the recipient of the payments, (iii) the payment start date, (iv) the interval of the payment (e.g. every week or every month) (v) the day on which the payment should be made (e.g. the day of the week or month) and (vi) the end date or that the payments will continue unless cancelled.
2.26. Once you have confirmed the standing order details, you will be redirected to your bank to authenticate yourself and Plaid will submit the standing order instruction to your Account Provider.
2.27. Once the standing order has been confirmed as received by your Account Provider, Plaid no longer has control over the execution of the standing order payments; this is the responsibility of your Account Provider.
2.28. You will be able to view your standing order via your Account Provider's online banking facility (where supported). If you wish to change or cancel a standing order, you must do so directly with your Account Provider before the deadline provided by your Account Provider and before the next payment is due. If you miss the deadline for cancelling or amending your standing order, your Account Provider may not be able to stop the next payment in time.
2.29. For further information on how you can cancel and amend standing orders you should refer to your Account Provider terms and conditions.
Variable Recurring Payments
2.30. Before receiving our payment initiation service to make variable recurring payments, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to make a payment order for a series of payment transactions to the same payee using Plaid (Variable Recurring Payments).
2.31. You will be asked to set up a mandate for the Variable Recurring Payments. This is your consent to Plaid to initiate a series of payments which fall within agreed consent parameters which are set by you, which may include: (i) the maximum amount per payment (ii) the frequency of the payments (iii) the maximum amount per frequency (e.g. no more than £50 per day/week/month/year) and (iv) the expiry date of the payment order (VRP Mandate). These details will either be pre-populated for you to review and confirm or you will be able to manually select your limits within the consent parameters. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the details in the VRP Mandate are correct. You may not be able to recover a payment made pursuant to a VRP Mandate if any details are not correct to an incorrect account or recipient.
2.32. You will confirm any details required in setting up the VRP Mandate and provide explicit consent for Plaid to: (i) send those details to your Account Provider; (ii) access your Payment Account; (iii) initiate payment transactions in accordance with the VRP Mandate; (iv) receive information from your Account Provider on the initiation and execution of your instructions; and (v) to pass this information on to the Application through which you accessed our Services.
2.33. When you set up a VRP Mandate you will be asked to select the Payment Account from which you will fund the Variable Recurring Payments and you will be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to the VRP Mandate and to Variable Recurring Payments being made under the VRP Mandate.
2.34. Once your Account Provider has confirmed authentication, either Plaid or the Application through which you accessed our Services will confirm to you that the VRP Mandate has been successfully set up. Plaid will then initiate payments under the VRP Mandate in accordance with payment requests made by the Application through which you have accessed our Services. Plaid will only initiate a payment under a VRP Mandate where the payment is within the parameters set by you in the VRP Mandate.
2.35. You will be able to view and manage your VRP Mandate through your Account Provider, the Application and Plaid. If you wish to withdraw your VRP Mandate then you can do so with your Account Provider, the Application or Plaid directly. For further information on how you can withdraw your VRP Mandate through your Account Provider, you should refer to your Account Provider terms and conditions.

’) blijven van kracht en deze Overeenkomst wijzigt niets aan uw Rekeningvoorwaarden.
2.4. Wij brengen u geen kosten in rekening voor het gebruik van onze Diensten. Applicaties of andere derden kunnen echter wel kosten in rekening brengen voor aan u geleverde producten en diensten die gebruikmaken van de door Plaid uit hoofde van deze Overeenkomst verleende Diensten.

Rekeninginformatiediensten
2.5. De rekeninginformatiediensten van Plaid stellen u in staat informatie betreffende de door u geselecteerde Betaalrekening te openen en te bekijken in het Plaid-dashboard (beschikbaar op
https://my.plaid.com/
) en de Applicatie waarmee u onze Diensten heeft geopend.
2.6. Om het Plaid-dashboard te openen, dient u bij Plaid een account aan te maken. U dient daarnaast te zorgen dat uw gegevens juist, volledig en actueel zijn.

2.10. Wij wijzen u erop dat het kan gebeuren dat u wordt doorgeleid naar de website of mobiele applicatie van uw Rekeningaanbieder om uw identiteit te verifiëren, zodat uw Rekeningaanbieder weet dat wij uw Rekeninginformatie openen met uw toestemming.
2.11. Het kan onder omstandigheden ook gebeuren dat wij u vragen ons de inloggegevens van uw Betaalrekening te verstrekken. Door ons de inloggegevens van uw Betaalrekening te verstrekken, bevestigt u dat u alle benodigde rechten, toestemmingen en bevoegdheden heeft om uw inloggegevens en Rekeninginformatie met ons te delen en geeft u ons expliciet toestemming om uw inloggegevens te gebruiken om uw Betaalrekening in te zien om namens en in opdracht van u de nodige Rekeninginformatie te verkrijgen teneinde u de Diensten te kunnen verlenen.

Het delen van de informatie stelt de Applicatie in staat u producten en diensten te leveren in overeenstemming met de Applicatievoorwaarden.
2.14. Wij controleren de Rekeninginformatie opgehaald van uw Rekeningaanbieder niet op juistheid en vertrouwen erop dat uw Rekeningaanbieder zorgt dat uw Rekeninginformatie actueel en juist is.
2.15. Wij kunnen uw Rekeninginformatie standaardiseren, categoriseren, samenvoegen, aggregeren en anderszins verwerken alvorens deze te tonen in het Plaid-dashboard, te delen met de Applicatie waarmee u onze Diensten heeft geopend of te delen met derden op aanwijzing van die Applicatie en met uw expliciete toestemming.

Plaid may send you Short Message Service (SMS) messages in order to provide a service to you and/or to confirm your identity by way of two-factor authentication. By agreeing to these SMS terms (“
SMS Terms
”), you consent to receive automated SMS messages from Plaid, and any of our SMS-related service providers (“
service providers
”), including through the use of an automatic telephone dialing system, at the telephone number you have provided. Message and data rates may apply. As a general matter, you will receive one message, per request. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
By agreeing to these SMS Terms, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Plaid or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help Plaid or our service provider identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. Please see our
End User Privacy Policy
to see how we treat your data.

Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent information will not be shared with any third parties.
If you do not wish to receive SMS messages from Plaid or our service providers, or if you no longer want your wireless operator to share information about you with Plaid or our service providers, you agree to reply STOP to any SMS message from Plaid or sent on behalf of Plaid in order to opt out of the SMS message notifications. You may receive an additional SMS message confirming your decision to opt out.

Plaid Account Terms
Effective Date: December 1, 2023
Background
. Thanks for using Plaid! Plaid is a service that helps consumers like you connect your financial accounts, share your financial data, verify your identity, make transfers and payments, and use other products and services involving your financial and identity data with your chosen applications that use Plaid (“
Apps
”).
Additional Terms
. These Plaid Account terms (“
Plaid Account Terms
”) supplement and incorporate by reference the
End User Services Agreement (US)
and together form an agreement between you and Plaid (the “
Agreement
”).
Please review all terms in the
End User Services Agreement (US)
, including in particular the Sections titled Rights to the Platform, Our Disclaimers, Liabilities for our Platform, Dispute Resolution, and Notices. Plaid may modify the Agreement upon notice to you, as detailed in the last paragraph of the
End User Services Agreement (US)
, and acceptance of these modifications will be required to continue using your Plaid Account.
Plaid Account
. Plaid allows you to save and manage your financial account connections and identity verification data in an account with Plaid (“Plaid Account”). This lets you accelerate your onboarding onto and use of Apps that use Plaid, including faster account connection, data sharing, identity verification, transfers and payments you make using Apps, and other products and services you use involving your financial and identity data in those Apps. Note that a Plaid Account is not a transaction or asset account for purposes of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, does not store funds, and does not provide you with a means to initiate electronic fund transfers or other payments, but instead enables you to onboard onto and use Apps more quickly and easily.
When you connect one or more financial accounts to an App using Plaid, Plaid may ask you to provide and verify your phone number, email address, or other contact information in order to create your Plaid Account and remember each of your connections within your Plaid Account. When you verify your identity with an App through Plaid, Plaid may ask whether you want to save your identity data within your Plaid Account. By creating a Plaid Account, you authorize Plaid to retain and use your financial account connections and identity data in accordance with the Agreement and Plaid’s
End User Privacy Policy
.
How Your Account Works
. Saving identity data and financial account connections in your Plaid Account enables you to more quickly onboard onto and use your Apps’ products and services. When you return to use your data and connections with your Apps, your Plaid Account helps us accurately recognize you and complete faster identity verification and account linking for you without you having to re-enter all of your saved information for each App.
As part of enabling these faster processes for you through your Plaid Account, Plaid may: (a) share with Apps, our subsidiaries, and our service providers information about whether or not you have a Plaid Account, and, if you do, certain information from your Plaid Account in order for us and them to provide services to you, including: (i) the number and types of financial account connections in your Plaid Account, (ii) the types of identity data and documents in your Plaid Account, and (iii) the services and use cases that Apps provide to you that can be supported by the financial account connections and identity data in your Plaid Account; (b) contact you using information that you provide or that is available in your saved identity data or financial account connections, including to send security notifications to confirm activity on your Plaid Account and messages outlining steps for you to complete or troubleshoot the process of using Plaid to onboard and use your Apps; and (c) verify your data to protect against fraud, misrepresentation, unauthorized or suspicious activity, or other malicious behavior – data we receive from this verification process may be stored in your Plaid Account for use when you return to share identity data with other Apps.
For more information about Plaid’s collection, use, and sharing of personal information about you, including in connection with your Plaid Account, please review Plaid’s
End User Privacy Policy
. The Agreement and Plaid’s
End User Privacy Policy
do not cover what Apps that you use do with your information. You should review the privacy policies and terms of service for those Apps for information about their practices.
Managing and Deleting Your Account

privacy@plaid.com

IDV Privacy Statement
Last Updated: December 18, 2024
Plaid Inc. and its subsidiaries, Plaid Financial Ltd. and Plaid, B.V. (collectively, “Plaid”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) offer identity verification, fraud detection, and watchlist screening services (the “IDV Services” or “Services”) globally to companies, firms, and financial institutions (“Customers” or “Customer”).
You may be asked by one of our Customers to complete various checks which use the IDV Services. This IDV privacy statement (“IDV Privacy Statement”) explains how your personal data (“Personal Information”) may be used when we carry out the IDV Services on behalf of our Customers.
Plaid does not knowingly collect, process, use, or share Personal Information for consumers under the age of 18. The IDV Services are intended only for individuals 18 years or older. If you are under 18, please do not use the IDV Services.
When we provide IDV Services to our Customers, our Customers determine the purpose and means by which Personal Information is processed (and our Customers are considered a data controller). We act on our Customers’ instructions with respect to how and why your Personal Information is processed. Plaid is a data processor or sub-processor when it facilitates identity verification, fraud detection, and watchlist screening services at the direction of our Customers. Our Customers direct us to collect your Personal Information. Plaid acts as a processor or sub-processor when directed to collect information from you, including Personal Information, and Plaid receives instructions from our Customers about whom to collect personal data from and when to collect and process Personal Information. We use your Personal Information to provide IDV Services to our Customers. We also transfer and/or provide access to download the information we collect from you, including Personal Information, to Customers at their instruction and request.
You should always check the privacy policies of our Customers and direct any queries and requests to exercise your rights with respect to your Personal Information to them.
Some of the IDV Services may be accessed directly by you, including through our websites that reference this policy (collectively “Sites”). In some instances, for example, if you are a Customer or if you wish to make an inquiry about the IDV Services, or if you visit our website, we may be a data controller. We describe how and why we use personal data in these circumstances in Plaid’s applicable privacy policies at
www.plaid.com/legal/
.
Plaid will not ever sell your Personal Information from the IDV Services to third parties. Our Customers decide how we use your Personal Information, control their data retention policies, and may specify how long to retain Personal Information and whether and when we share the information we collect, including your Personal Information, with our Customer.
Depending on the service required by our Customers, we may process Personal Information on our Customers' behalf as described in this IDV Privacy Statement, so we encourage you to read it carefully.

1. Overview
When Plaid provides IDV Services to Customers, you may be asked to provide information about yourself to us. On behalf of our Customers, we carry out cloud-based identity verification, fraud detection, and watchlist screening services. The IDV Services collect information from you and about you to predict and help to prevent fraudulent activity in real time. Plaid then completes our IDV Services and provides the results directly to our Customers. At our Customer's request, we provide a copy of or transfer the information you share, including your Personal Information, for Customer's use and as part of the IDV Services. We may transfer and/or provide access for our Customers to download the information we collect from you, including your Personal Information, per our Customer’s instructions.
Our Customers determine the scope of the request for information and what personal information about you might be used for analysis with the IDV Services. Customers configure the IDV Services to require and use certain information to verify your identity. A Customer may configure the IDV Services to ask for limited information. If the requested information is insufficient to provide verification, at our Customer’s instruction, the IDV Services may request additional information to complete the verification process.
If you are not satisfied with the result of any processing, you should direct your query to the Customer.
2. Information We May Collect
Depending on the IDV Services requested by our Customers, we may collect your Personal Information in the following ways:
Information you provide
: We collect your Personal Information when you provide information requested by the Customer to us. If you choose not to provide the requested information, we will not be able to provide our Customer with the IDV Services. Please contact the Customer to discuss alternative identity verification and screening options, if available for your region or nationality.
Some of the potential information about you that may be requested on behalf of our Customers includes contact details, including your name, email address, postal address, phone number, date of birth; identity documents with your image; your government-assigned identity number, such as a social security number; and/or a photograph or video image of you, to assess whether a person matches their identity document and appears to be a live person.
We collect data directly from you through industry-standard techniques such as JavaScript code, SDKs, form submissions, image collection, video collection, and behaviors using tools our Customers embed on their websites or mobile apps (
“Customer Sites”
).
Information used to verify a phone number
: We also may provide a two-factor authentication feature to our Customers to help provide measures to ensure that the person providing information has possession of the phone number associated with that identity. To provide this feature for our Customers, we may use your Personal Information provided by our Customer or by you to send verification codes to you, such as via text messages, which you can then enter to confirm your identity when you use a Customer Site or create a new account with a Customer.
Information we automatically collect when you visit Customer Sites
: The IDV Services use certain standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with and use Customer Sites, including behavioral analytics regarding your interaction with the IDV Services, and how often a device is used to interact with Customer Sites and the IDV Services. Some of this information includes, for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered Personal Information in some jurisdictions, including the EU.
The types of information we may collect on behalf of our Customers will depend on whether you visit a Customer Site via an API interface, an app using our SDK, or a webpage, including:
Browser and Device Information
, including device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version, web browser type and version, user agent, telephone carrier name and information, time zone, the network connection type, IP address, hardware-based identifiers, host name, device identifiers, Android/Google Advertising ID, canvas fingerprint, characteristics related to emulation or rooted such as if your device is “jailbroken”, and app name and version. We also collect character set, host name, language, page title and URL, referrer URL, number of fonts, fonts hash, number of plugins, plugins hash, screen height and width, color depth, platform, cookie footprint, maximum touch points, Java-Enabled, session storage, local storage, whether the resolution has been tampered, language or OS, whether ad blocking is enabled, whether do not track is enabled, flash socket IP and flash identifier. The SDK will also collect phone-related metadata such as battery level, device properties, and carrier name.
Information about your behavior on Customer's Sites
, i.e. information about your activities on Customer’s Sites, session ID, session start and stop time, time zone offset, and location information which may be general location information inferred from your IP address or, in some circumstances, more precise geolocation information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. You may be able to control the collection of location information through particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
How We Use Tracking Technologies to Collect Information about You.
We use standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information from your device and browser when you visit or interact with Customer Sites. When you view or use the IDV Services via a Customer Site, Plaid servers are notified, and we are able to collect information from the browser or application. In addition, we collect data directly from you through standard tracking technologies such as JavaScript or SDK, which our Customers can embed on their websites.
The types of tracking technologies we may use include:
JavaScript Code (JS Snippet)
, also called a tag or pixel, is a tiny snippet of code inserted into the content of the Customer Site. You can disable JavaScript by changing the settings on your browser. Information about how to change those settings can usually be found on your internet browser provider's website. Because Plaid does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
Mobile SDKs (Software Development Kits)
, or blocks of code embedded into a Customer Site that allow Plaid to collect certain information. You can control the use of certain information Plaid collects through the SDK by following the instructions applicable to your mobile device operating system. You may also be able to control whether and how your mobile device provides location information on particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device. Because Plaid does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
Canvas Fingerprinting
, a tracking technique that allows us to render graphic images from built-in features of HTML5 Canvas in your browser. The canvas image is often rendered differently on different devices because of a number of factors such as, your web browser version, operating system and its settings, and installed graphics hardware, and allows us to distinguish you from other users. If you would like to disable canvas fingerprinting, you may choose to disable JavaScript or download a browser extension that blocks canvas fingerprinting techniques but doing this may impair the functionality of the IDV Services. Because Plaid does not control these settings or extensions, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.
Device Fingerprinting
, a tracking technique that allows us to identify you using information related to your device’s software and hardware, including components of your canvas fingerprint as combined with your device information. Plaid uses device fingerprinting to stop fraud and other bad actors, as well as for cybersecurity.
Some of this information, such as your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device and therefore may be considered “Personal Information” in some jurisdictions, including the EU and California.
Information we collect from service providers and third party sources
: At our Customer’s request and as part of IDV Services for Customers, we may combine the information we collect about you with information we receive from service providers. For example, we may receive information such as whether an IP address is commercial or private, whether a phone number is a landline, or whether an email domain is free. Customers may also ask us to work with third parties that match information provided against third-party sources such as credit header files, mobile account records, utility records, motor vehicle records and other reputable sources. For certain countries, your mobile carrier may be asked to disclose your mobile account details for the purpose of verifying your identity, including your name, address, and device details. We may also receive information about you from third parties and/or collect information about you that is publicly available, on behalf of our Customer.
Special categories of personal data.
If our Customers require you to provide us with an document that contains your photograph or if you need to verify your identity by providing a photograph or video image of yourself, these images may reveal special categories of data about you, for example, information relating to your health (for example, if you wear glasses), your race or ethnicity or relating to your religious or political beliefs. We use these special categories of personal data only on our Customer's instructions and in accordance with any of our Customers' privacy policies and this IDV Privacy Statement and for no other reason. Plaid IDV does not sell Personal Information.
3. Biometric Information and Release
If our Customer requires you to provide us with an identity document that contains an image of your face and a photograph or video image (sometimes called a selfie), we may compare your derived facial geometry from the image on your identity document to your derived facial geometry in the photograph or video image that you provide to determine whether a person matches their identity document. We may also use your facial geometry scan to detect and prevent fraud, including to determine whether the video image is of a live person and/or determining your estimated age, if applicable. Your identity document image, photograph, or video image, and any derived facial geometry scans from those images, may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions.
By using the IDV Services to connect to an app or service provided by our Customer, you agree that you have read, understand, and voluntarily consent to
Plaid’s Biometric Policy and Release.
and release in favor of Plaid and Plaid’s service providers any claims related to the collection, processing, use, disclosure of, or sharing of your images, photographs, or video images, including any data derived from those images to create facial geometry scans.
For more information about our collection, use, processing, disclosure, and retention of your image from your identity document, photograph, or video image, including any derived facial geometry scans from those images that may be considered biometric data in your region, please see
Plaid’s Biometric Policy and Release.
4. How We May Use & Disclose Your Personal Information to Provide IDV Services to Customers
Our Customers may use our IDV Services and we return information to the Customer about the likelihood that the person providing the information is who they claim to be. We also transfer to Customer and/or provide access for Customers to download the information we collect from you, including your Personal Information, at our Customer's instruction and request.
Plaid uses your Personal Information to provide the IDV Services to our Customers, and to help our Customers comply with their legal obligations. We may also use device information or tracking technologies to identify and prevent fraud in the IDV Services. For example, we process your Personal Information through our cloud-based identity verification service to return match information to our Customers for particular events or activities on the Customer Site. In addition, when our Customers use two-factor authentication, we process your Personal Information, such as your telephone number, to send a verification code to you via text message. This helps our Customers who use this feature to verify identities by ensuring possession of the phone number associated with identities.
5. How We May Use Anonymized or Aggregate Information to Maintain,  Improve, and Develop the IDV Services
We may anonymize, de-identify, or aggregate information to maintain, improve, optimize or develop the IDV Services. We may also use anonymized, de-identified, or aggregated information to prevent and detect fraud in the IDV Services. Plaid IDV never uses your Personal Information to maintain, improve, optimize, or develop the IDV Services.
6. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the rights regarding your Personal Information we process on Customer’s behalf.
Data Protection Rights.
Where we act as a data processor, sub-processor, or service provider on behalf of our Customers, you must direct any request to access your Personal Information or to exercise any of your data protection rights to the Customer. We will assist our Customers in responding to your request and will act on their instructions.
Please see Plaid’s End User Privacy Policy at
https://plaid.com/legal/#consumers
for more details on how we deal with any requests where we are responsible for processing any personal data as a data controller.
7. Security and Retention
Security Safeguards

Data Retention
. Customers control their data retention policies and may specify how long to retain your Personal Information. When instructed by a Customer to do so, your Personal Information will either be deleted or anonymized.
8. Updates to this IDV Privacy Statement
We may revise the IDV Privacy Statement from time to time in response to our Customers requirements for the IDV Services and changing legal, technical, or business developments. We will provide any updates on our Site and the revised version will be effective when it is posted.

Biometric Policy and Release
Last Updated: November 11, 2024
Plaid’s Biometric Policy and Release (“Biometric Policy”) describes how Plaid Inc. and its subsidiaries, Plaid Financial Ltd. and Plaid, B.V. (collectively, “Plaid”) treat the photos and/or video images of your face, including scans of facial geometry extracted from those images, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions.
Plaid acts as a service provider for our customers when providing identity verification and fraud prevention services. To provide our identity verification and/or fraud prevention services, our customers may require you to provide Plaid and/or Plaid’s service providers with an identity document that contains your image and/or a photograph or video image of yourself.
Plaid and/or Plaid’s service providers collect and process the image from your identity document and your photograph or video image, at our customer’s instruction, to derive a scan of your facial geometry using facial recognition or similar technology in order to provide our customers with identity verification and fraud prevention services. Plaid and/or Plaid’s service providers may also process and use your photograph or video image for fraud detection and prevention services, including to determine whether your photograph or video image depicts a real person. Your identity document image, photograph, or video image, and any derived facial geometry scan from those images, may be considered biometric information in some jurisdictions.
Plaid and/or Plaid’s service providers will collect, process, obtain, use, and store your identity document image, photograph, or video image for the purpose of:
Comparing your derived facial geometry from the image on your identity document to your derived facial geometry in the photograph or video image that you provide to help verify your identity;
To detect and prevent fraud, including by determining your estimated age, if applicable, using an image from your identity document, an image from a photograph or video image of yourself, and/or your derived facial geometry; and
To maintain or provide our services for our customers, including assisting our Customers to review identity verification sessions.
The image from your identity document, photograph, or video images of your face, and your derived facial geometry, if applicable, are stored in an encrypted format by Plaid and Plaid’s service providers on behalf of Plaid’s customers.
PLAID AND PLAID’S SERVICE PROVIDERS NEVER USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR IMAGE EXTRACTED FROM YOUR IDENTITY DOCUMENT, PHOTOGRAPH, OR VIDEO IMAGE, INCLUDING ANY DERIVED FACIAL GEOMETRY SCAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR IMAGES, TO ENHANCE, IMPROVE, OR DEVELOP OUR SERVICES.
If you do not provide an identity document with an image of your face or a photograph and video image of yourself, Plaid and Plaid’s service providers will not process your images to derive your facial geometry data to compare your identity document to your photograph or video image. Plaid will retain a record of your partially completed verification process in accordance with customer’s instructions, unless otherwise required by law or legal process to delete such data after a shorter period of time. For more information, see our
IDV Privacy Statement
.
Retention and Storage
Where Plaid serves as a service provider, as defined by applicable law, our customers instruct Plaid to process, store, retain, or delete your identity document and/or photograph or video image.

Plaid does not sell biometric information. Plaid is not responsible for the policies or practices of its customers. Please see Plaid’s
IDV Privacy Statement
to understand how we collect and use your Personal Information on behalf of our customers. Plaid encourages you to also review our customers’ privacy policies and any applicable terms and conditions which may apply to their use of your data, some of which may be considered biometric data in your region.

Entities that access data covered by the rule in order to provide your requested product or service, which are referred to as ‘third parties,’ must comply with the obligations listed below. Compliance dates range from April 2026 to April 2030, based on the source of the data. You can view the full text of the rule on
the CFPB website
.
§ 1033.421 Third party obligations.
(a)
General limitation on collection, use, and retention of consumer data
—
(1)
In general.
The third party will limit its collection, use, and retention of covered data to what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumer’s requested product or service.
(2)
Specific purposes.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following are not part of, or reasonably necessary to provide, any other product or service:
(i) Targeted advertising;
(ii) Cross-selling of other products or services; or
(iii) The sale of covered data.
(b)
Collection of covered data
—
(1)
In general.
Collection of covered data for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section includes the scope of covered data requested and the duration and frequency of collection of covered data.
(2)
Maximum duration.
In addition to the limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section, the third party will limit the duration of collection of covered data to a maximum period of one year after the consumer’s most recent authorization.
(3)
Reauthorization after maximum duration.
To collect covered data beyond the one-year maximum period described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the third party will obtain a new authorization from the consumer pursuant to § 1033.401 no later than the anniversary of the most recent authorization from the consumer. The third party is permitted to ask the consumer for a new authorization pursuant to § 1033.401 in a reasonable manner. Indicia that a new authorization request is reasonable include its conformance to a consensus standard.
(c)
Use of covered data.
Use of covered data for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section includes both the third party’s own use of covered data and provision of covered data by that third party to other third parties. Examples of uses of covered data that are permitted under paragraph (a) of this section include:
(1) Uses that are specifically required under other provisions of law, including to comply with a properly authorized subpoena or summons or to respond to a judicial process or government regulatory authority;
(2) Uses that are reasonably necessary to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims, or other liability;
(3) Servicing or processing the product or service the consumer requested; and
(4) Uses that are reasonably necessary to improve the product or service the consumer requested.
(d)
Accuracy.
A third party will establish and maintain written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that covered data are accurately received from a data provider and accurately provided to another third party, if applicable.
(1)
Flexibility.
A third party has flexibility to determine its policies and procedures in light of the size, nature, and complexity of its activities.
(2)
Periodic review.
A third party will periodically review its policies and procedures and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued effectiveness.
(3)
Elements.
In developing its policies and procedures regarding accuracy, a third party must consider, for example:
(i) Accepting covered data in a format required by § 1033.311(b); and
(ii) Addressing information provided by a consumer, data provider, or another third party regarding inaccuracies in the covered data.
(4)
Indicia of compliance.
Indicia that a third party’s policies and procedures are reasonable include whether the policies and procedures conform to a consensus standard regarding accuracy.
(e)
Data security.
(1) A third party will apply to its systems for the collection, use, and retention of covered data an information security program that satisfies the applicable rules issued pursuant to section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801); or
(2) If the third party is not subject to section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the third party will apply to its systems for the collection, use, and retention of covered data the information security program required by the Federal Trade Commission’s Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information, 16 CFR part 314.
(f)
Provision of covered data to other third parties.
Before providing covered data to another third party, subject to the limitation described in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the third party will require the other third party by contract to comply with the third party obligations in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section and the condition in paragraph (i) of this section upon receipt of the notice described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(g)
Ensuring consumers are informed.
(1) Upon obtaining authorization to access covered data on the consumer’s behalf, the third party will provide the consumer with a copy of the authorization disclosure that the consumer has signed electronically or in writing and that reflects the date of the consumer’s electronic or written signature. The third party will deliver that copy of the authorization disclosure to the consumer or make it available in a location that is readily accessible to the consumer, such as the third party’s interface. If the third party makes the authorization disclosure available in such a location, the third party will ensure it is accessible to the consumer until the third party’s access to the consumer’s covered data terminates.
(2) The third party will provide contact information that enables a consumer to receive answers to questions about the third party’s access to the consumer’s covered data. The contact information must be readily identifiable to the consumer.
(3) The third party will establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures designed to ensure that the third party provides to the consumer, upon request, the information listed in this paragraph (g)(3) about the third party’s access to the consumer’s covered data. The third party has flexibility to determine its policies and procedures in light of the size, nature, and complexity of its activities, and the third party will periodically review its policies and procedures and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued effectiveness. The policies and procedures must be designed to ensure that the third party provides the following to the consumer, upon request:
(i) Categories of covered data collected;
(ii) Reasons for collecting the covered data;
(iii) Names of parties with which the covered data was shared. The names must be readily understandable to the consumer;
(iv) Reasons for sharing the covered data;
(v) Status of the third party’s authorization;
(vi) How the consumer can revoke the third party’s authorization to access the consumer’s covered data and verification the third party has adhered to requests for revocation; and
(vii) A copy of any data aggregator certification statement that was provided to the consumer pursuant to § 1033.431(c)(2).
(h)
Revocation of third party authorization
—
(1)
Provision of revocation method.
The third party will provide the consumer with a method to revoke the third party’s authorization to access the consumer’s covered data that is as easy to access and operate as the initial authorization. The third party will also ensure the consumer is not subject to costs or penalties for revoking the third party’s authorization.
(2) Notice of revocation. The third party will notify the data provider, any data aggregator, and other third parties to whom it has provided the consumer’s covered data when the third party receives a revocation request from the consumer.
(i)
Effect of maximum duration and revocation on collection, use, and retention.
If a consumer does not provide a new authorization as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or if a third party receives a revocation request as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or notice of a consumer’s revocation request as described in § 1033.331(e), a third party will:
(1) No longer collect covered data pursuant to the most recent authorization; and
(2) No longer use or retain covered data that was previously collected pursuant to the most recent authorization unless use or retention of that covered data remains reasonably necessary to provide the consumer’s requested product or service under paragraph (a) of this section.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with all laws applicable to you, including without limitation, the rules and guidelines of any system or network that facilitates payments and any security requirements, including under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), as may be applicable to you.

       us terminates or expires; or as reasonably necessary under applicable law.  After your Account 
       deactivation, we will deprovision your access to all End User Data associated with your integration.
Even after your Account deactivation, and to the extent permitted under applicable law, we may still 
      retain any information we collected about you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined 
      in our privacy policy/statement, or for a longer retention period if required or permitted under applicable law.

access or use the Services or access, transmit, process, or
        store End User Data in violation of any applicable privacy
        laws or in any manner that would be a breach of contract
        or agreement with the applicable end user;
access or use the Services to infringe any patent,
        trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or
        other right of any person or entity;
access or use the Services for any purpose other than for

        or End User Data without express prior written permission
        from Plaid;

        regulation.
Suspension and Termination
We reserve the right to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Services and/or End User Data in whole or in part where we believe the 
      Services are being accessed or used in violation of this Policy or any other Plaid agreement, including Plaid’s agreements with any third party 
      partners or data sources of Plaid (each, a “Partner”), or where use would pose a risk of harm, including reputational harm, to Plaid, its 
      infrastructure, its data, the Services, an end user, or a Partner.
We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email or other method when deciding to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Services 
      and/or End User Data. We may immediately suspend or terminate access without notice if appropriate under the circumstances, such as when we 
      become aware of activity that is a violation of any applicable law or when we determine, in our sole discretion, that harm is imminent.
Plaid will not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by you or any third party resulting from Plaid’s exercise of its rights under 
      this Policy or under applicable law.
Reporting Violations
If any person becomes aware of a violation of this Policy,
    we request that you immediately notify us via email to
legalnotices@plaid.com
. 
    We may take any appropriate action -- including reporting
    any activity or conduct that we suspect violates the law to
    appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other
    appropriate third parties -- in our sole discretion in
    respect to such violations.
Universal Data Access
Plaid promotes an Open Finance ecosystem in which end users own their data (e.g., financial data) 
      and may grant access to such data to third parties. To the extent that you host any such end user 
      data not already accessible by Plaid, upon Plaid’s reasonable request, the parties agree to cooperate 
      in good faith to negotiate and initiate an arrangement for Plaid to access such end user data on 
      behalf of end users.
Miscellaneous
The failure by you or Plaid to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein or in any other agreement 
      you may have with us shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
If any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or 
      eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Policy shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

        Plaid, y compris les contrats de Plaid avec des partenaires tiers ou des fournisseurs de données de Plaid (un « Partenaire »), ou lorsque l’utilisation 
        créerait un risque de nuisance, y compris à la réputation de Plaid, à son infrastructure, ses données, aux Services, à un utilisateur final ou un Partenaire.
Nous mettrons en œuvre des moyens raisonnables pour vous informer par e-mail ou par un autre moyen si nous décidons de retenir, refuser ou résilier un accès 
        aux Services ou aux Données des Utilisateurs Finaux. Nous nous réservons le droit de suspendre ou de résilier immédiatement l'accès sans préavis si les circonstances

Plaid n’est pas responsable des dommages de toutes natures subis par vous ou par un tiers résultant de l’exercice par Plaid de ses droits en vertu de la présente 
        Politique ou de la loi applicable.
Signalement des Violations
Nous demandons à toute personne ayant connaissance d’une violation de la présente Politique de nous en informer immédiatement par e-mail à l’adresse legalnotices@plaid.com.

        compétentes, aux régulateurs ou autres tiers compétents si nous soupçonnons qu’une activité ou conduite viole la loi.
Accès Universel aux Données
Plaid veut promouvoir un écosystème financier ouvert dans lequel les utilisateurs finaux détiennent leurs propres données (ex., des données financières) et peuvent accorder 
        l'accès à celles-ci à des tiers. Dans la mesure où vous hébergez de telles données d’utilisateurs finaux non accessibles par Plaid, les parties conviennent à la demande de Plaid,
         de coopérer de bonne foi afin de négocier et de convenir d’un arrangement afin que Plaid puisse accéder aux données des utilisateurs finaux au nom des utilisateurs finaux.
Divers
Le fait pour Plaid ou vous-même de ne pas exercer un droit prévu dans la présente Politique ne constitue aucunement un abandon de ce droit ou du droit de l’utiliser ultérieurement.
Si une disposition de la présente Politique se révélerait être inapplicable ou invalide, cette disposition sera limitée ou annulée dans les limites du minimum nécessaire de sorte que 
        la Politique demeure par ailleurs pleinement effective, en vigueur et applicable.

        acceso a terceros a tales datos. En la medida en que usted aloje cualesquiera de esos datos de usuario final a los que Plaid todavía no tenga acceso, a petición razonable
        de Plaid, las partes acuerdan cooperar de buena fe para negociar e iniciar un acuerdo en virtud del cual Plaid tenga acceso a dichos datos de usuario final por cuenta de
        los usuarios finales.
Miscelánea
La falta de ejercicio por su parte o por parte de Plaid, en cualquier aspecto, de cualquier derecho establecido en este documento o en cualquier otro acuerdo que usted pueda
        tener con nosotros, no se considerará una renuncia a cualquier otro derecho aquí reconocido.
Si cualquier disposición de la presente Política fuera declarada inaplicable o carente de validez, dicha disposición se limitará o eliminará en la medida mínima necesaria, de
        forma tal que esta Política continúe estando plenamente vigente, con plenos efectos y siendo aplicable.

ACCOUNT & CARD LIMITS
Limits may apply to the balance on your Account at any time, the maximum value of an individual payment Transaction, maximum Virtual Transaction value per Card, the maximum aggregate value of all payment Transactions made from your Account or Cards in a particular time period e.g. during any one Business Day and the maximum number of payment Transactions made from your Account over a particular timeframe. Your Cards may also have certain Card Transaction types disabled, such as cash withdrawals at an ATM.
The limits and restrictions that apply to your Account and Card will be communicated to you during the Account set-up process and/or before the Card is issued to you (as applicable). These limits may also change over time based on your Account and/or Card usage; any such change will be communicated to you. You can check the limits at any time by contacting Customer Services. You should not make a payment Transaction request which exceeds such.
From time to time a Card Transaction may be authorised which exceeds the limit or restriction applicable to your Account or Card, for example when it is used in an offline environment for example but not limited to payments for or on transport (purchases on a train, aeroplane, underground or toll payments). In such circumstance, a negative balance on your Account may occur. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.15 to 5.17 inclusive will apply.
Certain Merchants may require verification that the funds held on your Account will cover the Card Transaction amount and will place a "pre-authorisation" on your Card. This amount will be unavailable to you until the Card Transaction is completed or released by the Merchant. The pre-authorisation allows the Merchant up to 30 days to claim and settle any funds owed to them from the Card. Examples include but are not limited to hotels and rental cars. If there are insufficient funds available on your Account, Modulr must still make this settlement, which may result in a negative balance on your Account. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.15 to 5.17 inclusive will apply.
To manage our risk, particularly with respect to money laundering, fraud or security concerns, we also apply internal controls, including limits, to certain types of payment. We change these as necessary but for security purposes, we do not disclose them.
SCOPE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Your Account is an electronic money account (and therefore is not a traditional bank account) and the electronic money and any Card associated with it is issued to you by us. We are regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. for the issuance of electronic money. Your rights and obligations relating to the use of this Account are subject to these Terms and Conditions between you and us.
The types of Transactions enabled for your Account will be explained to you by the Partner Platform, or as subsequently enabled by us. The terms of these Modulr Account Terms and Conditions applicable to specific Transactions or payment types (for example, Cards) apply only to the extent that such Transactions or payment types are enabled for your Account.
This Agreement is written and available only in English and we undertake to communicate with you in English regarding any aspect of your Account.
You agree that we or the Partner Platform may communicate with you by e-mail or telephone for issuing any notices or information about your Account and therefore it is important that you ensure you keep your e-mail address and mobile phone number updated.
You can request a copy of these Terms and Conditions at any time by contacting Customer Services.
By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you acknowledge that the Dutch Deposit Guarantee Scheme or other government-sponsored insurance does not apply to funds held in the Account.
OPENING YOUR ACCOUNT
Your Account will be opened on your behalf by the Partner Platform. You may only hold an Account so long as you remain an approved client of the Partner Platform that provided you with your account details.
USING THE ACCOUNT
Your Account can receive bank transfers and other payment types as added and notified to you by Modulr from time to time. Subject to paragraph 5.3, we will credit your Account when we receive the funds which could be up to three Business Days after the payment being instructed, depending on how the payment was sent.
Your Account can also receive internal transfers from other Modulr Accounts owned or controlled by the Partner Platform, which apply instantly.
An incoming payment will not be credited to your Account if:
the Account has reached the Account Maximum Balance or Account Limits; or
the Account is blocked or terminated; or
the sender has provided incorrect/invalid Account Details for your Account; or
we suspect the payment to be fraudulent.
If we are unable to credit your Account for any of the reasons in paragraph 5.3 then the funds may be sent back to the sender without a prior notification to you.
Your Account will be configured and operated by the Partner Platform. You agree that Modulr and we may take instructions from the Partner Platform regarding the operation of your Account, including the creation of beneficiaries and instruction of payments, on your behalf. We and Modulr have no liability for actions taken by the Partner Platform. If you disagree with any actions taken by the Partner Platform these should be discussed with the Partner Platform. We are also authorised to take instructions from any other Account Manager (where different from Partner Platform) and, with respect to Physical Card Transactions, from the Cardholder. You are responsible for all actions of the Account Manager and any Cardholder in relation to the Account and/or Card(s).
Your Account can make payments out to external bank accounts via SEPA Transfer, Faster Payments, SWIFT Payments (if selected as a Modulr Product) and other methods as added and notified to you by the Partner Platform from time to time. With regard to SEPA Transfers, Modulr will automatically process inbound and outbound SEPA payments via SEPA Instant Credit Transfers where possible. In the event Modulr is unable to process such payments via SEPA Instant Credit Transfers, the payments will default to being made via SEPA Credit Transfers.
Where Cards are made available to you, your Account can be used to fund Card Transactions. You or your Account Manager or Partner Platform can request a Virtual Card or a Physical Card to be issued to you via the Online Portal or Modulr API.
Where a Virtual Card or Physical Card is issued to you, you may be able to register and/or store the details of the Card within third-party apps and/or devices and to use those third-party apps/devices to initiate payments with your Card. When you first register your Card within a third-party app/device we support, you may be required to verify that it is you requesting the registration of the Card. If you do not do this, you may not be able to register and use your Card through the third-party app/device.
The value of any Card Transaction, together with any applicable fees and charges, will be deducted from your Account once we receive the authorization request from the Merchant.
If the Card Transaction is made in a currency other than the currency the Card is denominated in, the Card Transaction will be converted to the currency of the Card by the relevant Card Scheme at a rate set by it on the day we receive details of the Card Transaction. The exchange rate varies throughout the day and is not set by us. You can check the relevant Card Scheme rate as follows:
Mastercard Card Scheme rate at:
https://www.mastercard.co.uk/en-gb/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html
;
VISA Card Scheme rate at:
https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html
.
If you use the Card to make a purchase online, you may be asked by the Merchant to use 3DS. Physical Cards are automatically enrolled for use with 3DS. When you use 3DS, you agree that the following shall apply in relation to your use of the Card:
You must provide us with your mobile phone number before you can use 3DS. You must ensure that your mobile phone can receive SMS at the time of your purchase.
When you use 3DS to purchase from a participating Merchant, you will be presented with an electronic receipt and the One-Time Passcode will be sent to your mobile phone.
Without your One-Time Passcode, you will not be able to make purchases from participating Merchants.
If you update your mobile phone number, then you must notify us immediately of your new details to ensure our records are correct.
The One-Time Passcode is valid for the purchase you received it for. You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your One-Time Passcode and must not share it with anyone else.
You will be responsible for any fees or charges imposed by your mobile phone service provider in connection with your use of 3DS.
A Transaction is deemed to be authorized by you when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform:
enters the security information on the Modulr Online Portal to confirm a Transaction is authorized or when it is instructed via the Modulr API with the relevant security credentials;
when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform submits a request for the creation of a Virtual Card via the Online Portal or Modulr API, you shall be deemed to have authorized any subsequent Virtual Card Transaction made using such Virtual Card up to the authorization value specified when creating the request for the creation of the Virtual Card;
when you or the Cardholder (i) enter a PIN or provide any other security credentials; (ii) sign a sales voucher; (iii) provide the Physical Card details and/or provide any other details as requested; (iv) wave/swipe the Physical Card over a card reader; or (v) insert the Physical Card into a card device or an ATM;
when you give instructions through a third party (such as the recipient of a Payment Initiation Service Provider).
Once the Transaction is confirmed, we cannot revoke the Transaction save for in those circumstances set out in paragraph 5.13 below.
You can cancel any Transaction which is agreed to take place on a date later than the date you authorized it, provided that you give us notice to cancel no later than the close of business on the Business Day before the Transaction was due to take place.
Cancelling a recurring Card Transaction with us will not cancel the agreement with the organization you are paying. It is your responsibility to tell the organization collecting the payment about the changes to your instructions.
If for any reason whatsoever, a negative balance arises because a Transaction is completed when there are not enough funds on your Account for that Transaction, you shall reimburse the negative balance amount immediately, unless circumstances described in sections 5.16 and 5.17 apply. You agree that once we make this negative balance known to you, we will charge you the amount of the negative balance, and you must repay it immediately. We may set-off the amount of the negative balance against any funds on your Account, including any subsequently loaded funds. Until we are reimbursed this negative balance amount, we may arrange for your Account, including Card(s), to be suspended. We may also report the negative balance to credit reference agencies.
Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of a Merchant where the Card Transaction occurred, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the Merchant.
Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of the recipient of the payment or us, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the person who made the error.
The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest.
You can check the balance and Transaction history of your Account at any time via the interface provided to you by the Partner Platform or by contacting Customer Services, or the Online Portal if you have relevant access details.
You will be provided with a monthly statement free of charge setting out information relating to individual payment Transactions by the Partner Platform or us (using the details we have associated with your Account).
THIRD PARTY ACCESS
You can instruct a TPP to access information on your Account or initiate certain Transactions from your Account provided such TPP has identified itself to us and it has acted in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements. We will treat any instruction from a TPP as if it was from you or an Account Manager.
We may deny a TPP access to your Account if we are concerned about unauthorised or fraudulent access by that TPP. Setting out the reason for such denial. Before doing so, we will tell you that we intend to deny access and give our reasons for doing so unless it is not reasonably practicable, in which case we will immediately inform you afterwards. In either case, we will tell you in the manner in which we consider most appropriate in the circumstances. We will not tell you if doing so would compromise our security measures or would otherwise be unlawful.
If you have provided consent to a TPP to access the data in your Account to enable them to provide account information services to you or initiate Transactions on your behalf, you consent to us sharing your information with the TPP as is reasonably required for them to provide their services to you. You must let us know if you withdraw this permission and we recommend you let the TPP know. On notification from you, we will not provide such TPP access to your Account or the data in it.
CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT
You may close your Account by contacting Customer Services. Please refer to your contract with the Partner Platform for any terms relating to your need to maintain your Account.
The Account will be closed if the Partner Platform instructs us to close your Account (in which case the Partner Platform will inform you of this instruction).
On termination of the Agreement for any reason, these Terms and Conditions will automatically terminate, and your Account will be closed, and any Cards issued to you will be cancelled.

If for any reason this is not possible, such Available Balance will remain yours, and you may at any time request a refund by contacting Customer Services.

DISPUTES AND INCORRECT TRANSACTIONS
If you (or an Account Manager or Cardholder) have a reason to believe that:
a Transaction on your Account was unauthorized or made incorrectly,
a Physical Card is lost or stolen, or
someone else (other than TPP) knows the security credentials or has unauthorized access to your Account and/or Card,
you must inform us immediately by contacting Customer Services. After you notify us, we will replace a lost, stolen, or misappropriated Physical Card and/or security credentials, as appropriate.
We will investigate your claim for a refund of unauthorized or incorrectly executed Transactions, provided that you have notified us without undue delay upon becoming aware of such incorrectly executed or unauthorized Transaction, and in any case within the timeframes required by the Card Scheme rules for Card Transactions or within 13 months of the date of the relevant Transaction for all other Transactions. We will not be liable for any unauthorized or incorrectly executed Transactions notified to us after this period.
If you dispute a Transaction:
Subject to 9.3.2 and 9.3.3, we will immediately refund the amount to your Account to the position it would have been in if the unauthorized Transaction had not taken place. We will have no further liability to you. If we subsequently discover that you were not entitled to a refund, we shall treat the refund as a mistake and be entitled to reapply the Transaction.
If there are reasonable grounds for thinking that you may not be entitled to a refund, we may investigate before giving you a refund and provide you with our supporting evidence if we believe you are not entitled to the refund.
If the Transaction was initiated through a TPP, it is for the TPP to prove that the Transaction was authenticated, accurately recorded, and not affected by a technical breakdown or other deficiency linked to the TPP's payment initiation service.
If an incorrect Transaction is paid into your Account that should not have been, we will, where possible, immediately send the funds back to the bank acting for the person from whose account the Transaction was made. In such circumstances, you agree to return the funds to us and provide the necessary assistance to recover the amount from you. If we cannot recover the funds, we are required to provide sufficient details about you and the incorrect payment to the bank or institution that sent the payment to enable them to recover the funds.
You will be liable for all Transactions made from your Account if you (or the Account Manager or the Cardholder) have acted fraudulently or have failed with gross negligence:
to keep the security credentials used to access or use your Account and/or Card safe and secure or otherwise failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions in relation to the safety of your Account and/or Card, or
failed to notify us in accordance with 9.1 above.
You may be entitled to a refund for a Transaction initiated by a payee if:
the authorization did not specify the exact amount,
the amount of the Transaction exceeded what you could reasonably have expected, taking into account your previous spending pattern and other relevant circumstances (we may request information to determine if this is correct), and
you requested a refund within 8 weeks of the date the Transaction was debited to your Account.
In such circumstances, we will refund you within 10 Business Days of receiving your claim for a refund or, where applicable, within 10 Business Days of receiving any further requested information. If we refuse the refund, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal.
VARIATION
We may change these Terms and Conditions by providing you with at least two months' prior notice by e-mail (provided you have supplied us with an up-to-date e-mail address).
If you do not agree with the changes to the Terms and Conditions, you may notify us at any time within the two months' notice period, and these Terms and Conditions will be terminated, and your Account closed free of charge. If you do not notify us otherwise during this period, you will be deemed to have accepted the change, and it will apply to you when it comes into force.
If any part of these Terms and Conditions is inconsistent with any legal requirements, we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it actually reflected the relevant legal requirement. If operational changes are necessary to fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.
TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION
We can terminate your Account at any time if we give you two months' notice and transfer any Available Balance at the time to your nominated bank account without a charge.
We can suspend or terminate your Account at any time with immediate effect (and until your default has been remedied or the Agreement terminated) without any prior notice to you if:
we discover that any of the Information we hold for you is false, misleading, or materially incorrect, or
you, the Account Manager, the Cardholder, or a third party has engaged in fraudulent activity, money laundering, terrorism, terrorism financing, or other illegal activity in connection with your Account, or we have reasonable suspicions in respect of the same, or
you have reached your Account Limit, or

ACCOUNT & CARD LIMITS
Limits may apply to the balance on your Account at any time, the maximum value of an individual payment Transaction, maximum Virtual Transaction value per Card, the maximum aggregate value of all payment Transactions made from your Account or Cards in a particular time period e.g. during any one Business Day and the maximum number of payment Transactions made from your Account over a particular timeframe. Your Cards may also have certain Card Transaction types disabled, such as cash withdrawals at an ATM.
The limits and restrictions that apply to your Account and Card will be communicated to you during the Account set-up process and/or before the Card is issued to you (as applicable). These limits may also change over time based on your Account and/or Card usage; any such change will be communicated to you. You can check the limits at any time by contacting Customer Services. You should not make a payment Transaction request which exceeds such.
From time to time a Card Transaction may be authorised which exceeds the limit or restriction applicable to your Account or Card, for example when it is used in an offline environment for example but not limited to payments for or on transport (purchases on a train, aeroplane, underground or toll payments). In such circumstance, a negative balance on your Account may occur. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.14 to 5.16 inclusive will apply.
Certain Merchants may require verification that the funds held on your Account will cover the Card Transaction amount and will place a “pre-authorisation” on your Card. This amount will be unavailable to you until the Card Transaction is completed or released by the Merchant. The pre-authorisation allows the Merchant up to 30 days to claim and settle any funds owed to them from the Card. Examples include but are not limited to hotels and rental cars. If there are insufficient funds available on your Account, Modulr must still make this settlement, which may result in a negative balance on your Account. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.14 to 5.16 inclusive will apply.
To manage our risk, particularly with respect to money laundering, fraud or security concerns, we also apply internal controls, including limits, to certain types of payment. We change these as necessary but for security purposes, we do not disclose them.
SCOPE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Your Account is an electronic money account and the electronic money and any Card associated with it is issued to you by us. We are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for the issuance of electronic money (FRN 900573). Your rights and obligations relating to the use of this Account are subject to these Terms and Conditions between you and us.
The types of Transactions enabled for your Account will be explained to you by the Partner Platform, or as subsequently enabled by us. The terms of these Modulr Account Terms and Conditions applicable to specific Transactions or payment types (for example, Cards) apply only to the extent that such Transactions or payment types are enabled for your Account.
This Agreement is written and available only in English and we undertake to communicate with you in English regarding any aspect of your Account.
You agree that we or the Partner Platform may communicate with you by e-mail or telephone for issuing any notices or information about your Account and therefore it is important that you ensure you keep your e-mail address and mobile phone number updated.
You can request a copy of these Terms and Conditions at any time by contacting Customer Services.
OPENING YOUR ACCOUNT
Your Account will be opened on your behalf by the Partner Platform. You may only hold an Account so long as you remain an approved client of the Partner Platform that provided you with your account details.
USING THE ACCOUNT
Your Account can receive bank transfers and other payment types as added and notified to you by Modulr from time to time. Subject to paragraph 5.3, we will credit your Account when we receive the funds which could be up to three Business Days after the payment being instructed, depending on how the payment was sent.
Your Account can also receive internal transfers from other Accounts owned or controlled by the Partner Platform, which apply instantly.
An incoming payment will not be credited to your Account if:
the Account has reached the Account Limits; or
the Account is blocked or terminated; or
the sender has provided incorrect/invalid Account Details for your Account; or
we suspect the payment to be fraudulent.
If we are unable to credit your Account for any of the reasons in paragraph 5.3 then the funds may be sent back to the sender without a prior notification to you.
Your Account can make payments out to external bank accounts via Faster Payments, SEPA Transfer, SWIFT Payments (if selected as a Modulr Product) and other methods as added and notified to you by the Partner Platform from time to time.
Your Account will be configured and operated by the Partner Platform. You agree that Modulr and we may take instructions from the Partner Platform regarding the operation of your Account, including the creation of beneficiaries and instruction of payments, on your behalf. We and Modulr have no liability for actions taken by the Partner Platform. If you disagree with any actions taken by the Partner Platform these should be discussed with the Partner Platform. We are also authorised to take instructions from any other Account Manager (where different from Partner Platform) and, with respect to Physical Card Transactions, from the Cardholder. You are responsible for all actions of the Account Manager and any Cardholder in relation to the Account and/or Card(s).
Where Cards are made available to you, your Account can be used to fund Card Transactions. You or your Account Manager or Partner Platform can request a Virtual Card or a Physical Card to be issued to you via the Online Portal or Modulr API.
Where a Virtual Card or Physical Card is issued to you, you may be able to register and/or store the details of the Card within third party apps and/or devices and to use those third party apps/devices to initiate payments with your Card. When you first register your Card within a third party app/device we support, you may be required to verify that it is you requesting the registration of the Card. If you do not do this, you may not be able to register and use your Card through the third party app/device.
The value of any Card Transaction, together with any applicable fees and charges, will be deducted from your Account once we receive the authorisation request from the Merchant.
If the Card Transaction is made in a currency other than the currency the Card is denominated in, the Card Transaction will be converted to the currency of the Card by the relevant Card Scheme at a rate set by it on the day we receive details of the Card Transaction. The exchange rate varies throughout the day and is not set by us. You can check the relevant Card Scheme rate as follows.
Mastercard Card Scheme rate at: https://www.mastercard.co.uk/en-gb/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html;
VISA Card Scheme rate at: https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html.
A Transaction is deemed to be authorised by you:
when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform enters the security information on the Modulr Online Portal to confirm a Transaction is authorised, or when it is instructed via the Modulr API with the relevant security credentials;
when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform submits a request for a creation of a Virtual Card via the Online Portal or Modulr API, you shall be deemed to have authorised any subsequent Virtual Card Transaction made using such Virtual Card up to the authorisation value specified when creating the request for creation of the Virtual Card;
when you or the Cardholder (i) enter a PIN or provide any other security credentials; (ii) sign a sales voucher; (iii) provide the Physical Card details and/or provide any other details as requested; (iv) wave/swipe the Physical Card over a card reader; or (v) insert the Physical Card into a card device or an ATM;
when you give instructions through a third party (such as the recipient of a Direct Debit Mandate or a Payment Initiation Service Provider). Once the Transaction is confirmed, we cannot revoke the Transaction save for in those circumstances set out in paragraph 5.10 below.
You can cancel any Transaction which is agreed to take place on a date later than the date you authorised it, provided that you give us notice to cancel no later than close of business on the Business Day before the Transaction was due to take place;
Cancelling a Direct Debit Mandate with us will not cancel the agreement with the organisation you are paying. It is your responsibility to tell the organisation collecting the payment about the changes to your instructions.
If for any reason whatsoever, a negative balance arises because a Transaction is completed when there are not enough funds on your Account for that Transaction, you shall reimburse the negative balance amount immediately, unless circumstances described in sections 5.15 and 5.16 apply. You agree that once we make this negative balance known to you, we will charge you the amount of negative balance and you must repay it immediately. We may charge the amount of the negative balance against any funds on your Account, including any subsequently loaded funds. Until we are reimbursed this negative balance amount, we may arrange for your Account, including Card(s) to be suspended. We may also report the negative balance to credit reference agencies.
Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of a Merchant where the Card Transaction occurred, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the Merchant.
Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of the recipient of the payment or us, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the person who made the error.
The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest.
You can check the balance and Transaction history of your Account at any time via the interface provided to you by the Partner Platform or by contacting Customer Services, or the Online Portal if you have relevant access details.
You will be provided with a monthly statement free of charge setting out information relating to individual payment Transactions by the Partner Platform or us (using the details we have associated with your Account).
THIRD PARTY ACCESS
You can instruct a TPP to access information on your Account or initiate certain Transactions from your Account provided such TPP has identified itself to us and it has acted in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements. We will treat any instruction from an TPP as if it was from you or an Account Manager.
We may deny a TPP access to your Account if we are concerned about unauthorised or fraudulent access by that TPP. setting out the reason for such denial. Before doing so, we will tell you that we intend to deny access and give our reasons for doing so, unless it is not reasonably practicable, in which case we will immediately inform you afterwards. In either case, we will tell you in the manner in which we consider most appropriate in the circumstances. We will not tell you if doing so would compromise our security measures or would otherwise be unlawful.
If you have provided consent to a TPP to access the data in your Account to enable them to provide account information services to you or initiate Transactions on your behalf, you consent to us sharing your information with the TPP as is reasonably required for them to provide their services to you. You must let us know if you withdraw this permission and we recommend you let the TPP know. On notification from you, we will not provide such TPP access to your Account or the data in it.
CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT
You may close your Account by contacting Customer Services. Please refer to your contract with the Partner Platform for any terms relating to your need to maintain your Account.
The Account will be closed if the Partner Platform instructs us to close your Account (in which case the Partner Platform will inform you of this instruction).
On termination of the Agreement for any reason, these Terms and Conditions will automatically terminate, and your Account will be closed and any Cards issued to you will be cancelled.
Any Available Balance remaining on the Account after Account closure will be transferred to your nominated bank account via Faster Payments or SEPA Transfer (as relevant) based on instructions to us from the Partner Platform. If for any reason this is not possible, such Available Balance will remain yours for a period of six years from the date of Account closure. Within this period, you may at any time request a refund by contacting Customer Services. You will not have any access to your Account and we will not return any funds remaining on the Account after six years from the date of Account closure and this Agreement will terminate.
YOUR LIABILITY AND AUTHORISATIONS
You are responsible for understanding and complying with the Agreement including these Terms and Conditions.
We may at any time suspend, restrict or refuse to authorise any use of your Account and/or Cards (including cancelling Card(s)) or refuse to process your instructions or authorise any particular Transaction where:
we are concerned about the security of or access to your Account and/or your Card;
we know or suspect that that your Account and/or Card is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;
we need to do so in order to comply with the law or otherwise for regulatory or crime prevention purposes;
the Transaction would breach the limits applicable to your Account and/or Card;
you, the Account Manager or the Cardholder breach an important part of these Terms and Conditions, or repeatedly breach any term in this Agreement and fail to resolve the matter in a timely manner.
If we cancel, suspend or restrict your Account and/or Card(s), or otherwise refuse to execute a payment order to or to initiate a Transaction, we will, without undue delay and provided we are legally permitted to do so, notify you or the Partner Platform of the refusal, suspension or cancellation (as applicable). If possible, we will provide the reasons for the refusal to execute the Transaction and/or suspending the use of your Account and/or Card and where those reasons relate to factual matters, the procedure of rectifying any factual errors that led to the refusal.
You or the Account Manager or the Cardholder must not:
allow another person to use security information related to the Account, Cards and/or app/device you use to make Transactions
write down password(s) or any security information unless this is done in a way that would make it impossible for anyone else to recognise any of that information, or
disclose passwords or any security information, or otherwise make them available to any other person, whether verbally or by entering them in a way that allows them to be observed by others.
You must take all reasonable steps to keep your Account and password(s) and any other security-related details safe, including the security-related details relating to any app and/or devices you have registered or stored your Card on, at all times. If you visit a website or receive a message that asks for your password, other than the Modulr website, this should be reported to us. If you are in doubt whether a website is genuine, you should contact Customer Services. If you have any indication that your Account, password or other security information has been compromised, you must immediately change your password and notify us as soon as possible.
You will be liable for all Transactions that take place as a result of you, the Account Manager or the Cardholder acting fraudulently or failing to comply with these Terms and Conditions with intent or gross negligence. Any such Transactions and any fees and charges relating to such Transactions will be deducted from the Available Balance on your Account.
You will be liable for all Transactions that the Partner Platform, any other Account Manager makes on your behalf or the Cardholder makes as per this Agreement, along with those made by a TPP authorised by you to initiate a Transaction.
You will be liable for all unauthorised Transactions that arise from the use of lost or stolen Physical Cards, the Account or Card security information such as but not limited to the Online Portal log in details and API security details, Card number and CVV if you, the Account Manager, or the Cardholder fail to keep the security features of the Account, Cards and/or app/device where your Card is registered/stored safe.
It is your responsibility to keep us updated of changes to your Information, including e-mail address and mobile numbers. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to contact you regarding your Account or to let you know about changes to these Terms and Conditions.
If you request to recall a Transaction due to an error or mistake caused other than by Modulr, we reserve the right to charge you (i) a handling fee of £25 per recall and (ii) any fee payable by Modulr to a third-party bank or institution for handling the recall.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless, us, Modulr and our distributors, partners, agents, sponsors, and service providers and their group companies from and against the costs of any legal action taken to enforce this Agreement, including these Terms and Conditions and/or any breach of these Terms and Conditions by you.
DISPUTES AND INCORRECT TRANSACTIONS
If you (or an Account Manager or Cardholder) have a reason to believe that (i) a Transaction on your Account was unauthorised or was made incorrectly, (ii) a Physical Card is lost or stolen; or (iii) someone else (other than TPP) knows the security credentials or otherwise has unauthorised access to your Account and/or Card, you must inform us immediately by contacting Customer Services. After you notify us, we will replace a lost, stolen or misappropriated Physical Card and/or security credentials, as appropriate.
We will investigate your claim for a refund of unauthorised or incorrectly executed Transactions, provided at all times that you have notified us without undue delay of becoming aware of such incorrectly executed or unauthorised Transaction and in any case within the timeframes required by the Card Scheme rules if the incorrect Transaction relates to a Card Transaction and for all other Transactions within 13 months of the date of the relevant Transaction. We will not be liable for any unauthorised or incorrectly executed Transactions notified to us after this period.
If you dispute a Transaction:
subject to 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 we will immediately refund the amount to your Account to the position it would have been in if the unauthorised Transaction had not taken place. We will have no further liability to you. If we subsequently discover that you were not entitled to a refund, we shall treat the refund as a mistake and be entitled to reapply the Transaction.
if there are reasonable grounds for thinking that you may not be entitled to a refund (based on the evidence available to us at the time you report the unauthorised Transaction), we may investigate before giving you a refund and we will provide you with our supporting evidence if we believe you are not entitled to the refund;
if the Transaction was initiated through a TPP, it is for the TPP to prove that, the Transaction was authenticated, accurately recorded and not affected by a technical breakdown or other deficiency linked to the TPP's payment initiation service; and
if we make an error on a Transaction made to someone else through the Direct Debit scheme, we will refund you in accordance with the Direct Debit Guarantee.
If an incorrect Transaction is paid into your Account that should not have, we will, where possible, immediately send the funds back to the bank acting for the person from whose account the Transaction was made. In such circumstance you agree to return the funds to us and provide such assistance that we require in recovering the amount from you. If we cannot recover the funds, we are required to provide sufficient details about you and the incorrect payment to the bank or institution that sent the payment to enable them to recover the funds.
You will be liable for all Transactions made from your Account if you (or the Account Manager or the Cardholder) have acted fraudulently or have failed with gross negligence:
to keep the security credentials used to access or use your Account and/or Card safe and secure or otherwise failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions in relation to the safety of your Account and/or Card; or
failed to notify us in accordance with 9.1 above.
You may be entitled to a refund where a Transaction from your account which was initiated by payee provided that:
the authorisation did not specify the exact amount;
the amount of Transaction exceeded the amount you could reasonably have expected (taking into your previous spending pattern and other relevant circumstances). We may ask you to provide such information as is reasonably necessary for us to determine if this is correct; and
you asked for a refund within 8 weeks of the date the Transaction was debited to your Account.
In such circumstances we will refund you within 10 Business Days of receiving your claim for a refund or, where applicable, within 10 Business Days of receiving any further information we requested - or we will provide you with reasons for refusing the refund.
If you want a refund for a Transaction made using the Direct Debit scheme, the Direct Debit Guarantee will apply instead of the terms in 9.6 above.
VARIATION
We may change these Terms and Conditions by providing you with at least two months' prior notice by e-mail (provided you have supplied us with an up-to-date e-mail address).
If you do not agree with the changes to the Terms and Conditions, you may at any time within the two months' notice period notify us and these Terms and Conditions will be terminated and your Account closed. If you do not notify us to the contrary during this period then you will be deemed to have accepted the change and it will apply to you when it comes into force.
If any part of these Terms and Conditions are inconsistent with any legal requirements then we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it did actually reflect the relevant legal requirement. If we need to make operational changes before we can fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.
TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION
We can terminate your Account at any time if we give you two months' notice and transfer any Available Balance at the time to your nominated bank account without a charge.
We can suspend or terminate your Account at any time with immediate effect (and until your default has been remedied or the Agreement terminated) without any prior notice to you if:
we discover any of the Information that we hold for you is false, misleading or materially incorrect; or

if you have reached your Account Limit;
you or the Account Manager have breached these Terms and Conditions; or
we are required to do so under any applicable law or regulation or at the direction of any regulatory, law enforcement or other competent authority.

UK Safeguarding
A message from Modulr: How we keep customer funds safe
At Modulr, we work hard to ensure that all our customer communications are clear and we're committed to playing our part in increasing standards across the industry. So, we welcome the chance to offer further clarity around the differences in protections between our services and traditional banking, and answer some frequently asked questions.
Who is Modulr?
Modulr is the embedded payments platform for digital businesses that need a faster, easier and more reliable way to move money. We provide the digital infrastructure that enables our customers and partners to embed payment and account functionality directly into their platforms, workflows and customer experiences.
Is Modulr a bank?
Modulr is not a bank, we're an E-money Institution (EMI).
An EMI is an organisation that has been authorised by the regulator to issue e-money accounts and provide related payment services. In the UK, we're authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and in the EU we're regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank.
Our payment accounts come with sort codes or Euro IBANs, access to payment schemes and everything you would expect, but all in a faster, easier and more reliable way.
How is Modulr different from a bank?
One of the main differences between Modulr, an EMI, and a bank is that banks lend money, whereas EMIs are prohibited from lending money. Specifically, banks receive deposits from customersthat they use to lend money out and make a profit on the difference . By contrast, an EMI such as Modulr holds 100% of client funds at all times, does not lend any customer funds or offer interest on balances.
Our payment services however are regulated by the same payments regulations that apply to banks.
How does Modulr protect customer funds?
Modulr is required by law to use a process called Safeguarding to protect customer money. This means we ensure that 100% of the funds we receive in exchange for e-money are safeguarded on receipt, meaning that these are segregated from all other funds that we hold and they cannot be used for any other purposes. This is completely separate from the additional funds that Modulr holds to meet its corporate obligations and run its business. 100% of the funds we safeguard must be held in specially designated client accounts at credit institutions (banks) or the Bank of England (see 'Where is my money safeguarded?' below).
Furthermore, as an EMI, we must also hold an additional 2% of the total value of safeguarded client funds in our own funds, which are held separately to those client funds. The purpose of the additional 2% funds is to ensure that, in the case of any problems with our business, there are enough funds to support an orderly business wind-down and the process of returning of client funds . Combining this '2%' requirement with the safeguarding means that customer funds are 100% available to a customer, and there is a protection mechanism to help ensure an orderly wind down if ever required.
So, while the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is not applicable to e-money, the regulatory requirements outlined above can be relied upon instead and protects the balance of customer funds, as opposed to only compensating up to a limit as is the case with the FSCS
What is the FSCS and is it applicable to Modulr?
The FSCS offers consumers protection of their bank deposits up to £85,000 maximum, or £170,000 for a joint account, in the event of a bank failure. The FSCS scheme only applies to banks, and therefore is not relevant to an EMI such as Modulr. However, as mentioned, Safeguarding means that 100% of customer money at Modulr, regardless of the amount, is segregated from all other funds that we hold and cannot be used for any other purpose.
What would happen in the unlikely event of Modulr's insolvency?
In addition to the safeguarding and further '2%' requirements we're also required to prepare orderly wind down planning. These plans include the early identification of a potential insolvency event and the return of your funds before an insolvency process if possible. We have to provide these plans to the FCA and they are subject to external audit review. This further reduces the unlikely event of your funds having to be returned during our insolvency. In the unlikely event that Modulr becomes insolvent, your funds are separate from the funds of Modulr and therefore the creditors of Modulr (other third parties that are owed money from Modulr) are not able to make a claim or have effect on your funds.
An independent insolvency professional (referred to as an 'insolvency practitioner') will be appointed to return your funds to you. However, where an insolvency practitioner is unable to take their costs of sending the funds to you from elsewhere (for example, the general pot of Modulr funds remaining or from the additional 2% own funds described above) they are entitled to take their costs from your funds. In this unlikely circumstance, while you'll likely receive most of your funds you may not receive the total value if costs are deducted. The process of returning your funds by an insolvency practitioner is likely to take longer than if you were making a claim in the FSCS.
Where is money safeguarded?
Modulr must deposit 100% of the value if all the e-money it has issued to customers at a credit institution (banks) or the Bank of England. Modulr uses a range of clearing banks for different services but, with our direct access to Faster Payments and Bacs, Modulr is one of a few non-bank Payment Service Providers to hold funds associated with GBP domestic flows directly at the Bank of England. Our safeguarding processes are subject to independent yearly external audit, providing further confidence that we adhere to the regulations required for safeguarding.
Who regulates Modulr in the UK?
Modulr FS Ltd (FRN: 900573) is licensed as an authorised E-Money Institution (EMI) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This enables Modulr to issue e-money to its customers, hold customer funds in safeguarded accounts and provide related payment services to customers. Modulr Finance Limited (FRN: 900699) is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority as an EMD Agent of Modulr FS Limited.
Payment services in the UK are subject to the Payment Services Regulations (PSRs). The PSRs apply to all payment services, meaning in relation to payment services, there is no difference in how Modulr and other payment service providers and banks are regulated.
Who regulates Modulr in the EU?
Modulr Finance B.V. is licensed and regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank (Relatienummer R182870) as an Electronic Money Institution.

California Candidates Data Protection Rights
and

.
Plaid does not use your personal data for automated individual decision making (including profiling).
How We Disclose Your Information
We disclose your personal data to others as follows, or as otherwise described in this Notice:
between and among Plaid and our subsidiaries and affiliated entities
, as the specific entity you're applying to work for is part of a wider group of companies with headquarters in the United States and offices in various jurisdictions that share human resources and IT systems for processing your application, assessing your suitability for the role, and initiating employment (if applicable);
with our data processors and other service providers
, including data analytics service providers, background check service providers, and recruitment agencies, in connection with the services they perform for us or on our behalf. Where required, these service providers, partners, or vendors acting on our behalf will be subject to contractual obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Candidate Information, and to process it only as instructed.
to law enforcement, government authorities, regulators, and other third parties
, such as courts and other authorities, independent external advisers and internal compliance and investigation teams, if we believe such disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process;
in connection with, or during the negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company
, as permitted by applicable law;
as necessary to protect Plaid
, including to establish, exercise, or defend against potential, threatened or actual legal claims;
to enforce any contract with you or if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our policies
;
to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity
; or
for any other notified purpose, with your consent or at your direction
.
We may also use or disclose aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
Our Lawful Bases for Processing (UK and EEA Candidates Only)
For candidates in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting, using, and sharing Candidate Information will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collected or processed it. In general, however, we will normally only collect and process Candidate Information where:
(a) we need to comply with legal obligations applicable to us (such as applicable immigration and/or employment laws and regulations);
(b) we need the information to fulfill our responsibilities in any actual or prospective agreement with you (such as an employment agreement or an offer of employment if you are considered for employment);
(c) the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (such as to ensure a safe working environment for all our team members, and to ensure the reliability of our candidates, and otherwise to administer and process your application, or to communicate with you about your application); and
(d) we have your consent to do so (in cases where your consent is truly freely given).
Where we are legally allowed or required to collect and process special categories of data (for example, race), then we will only process such information:
where we reasonably need to do so in order to comply with our legal obligations as a prospective employer;
where we need to do so in order to be informed of your working capacity;
where we need to do so to protect your or another person's vital interests (and we are unable to obtain your consent); or
where you have given us your consent (in cases where your consent is truly freely given).
To the extent we rely on consent to collect and process Candidate Information, you have the right to decline your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at
people-privacy@plaid.com
. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal data conducted for other purposes in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
Our Retention Practices
We retain Candidate Information for no longer than necessary to satisfy the purpose for which it was collected and used, as described in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted under applicable law. As noted above, however, if you accept employment with Plaid, your Candidate Information will become part of your employment record and will be used for employment purposes in accordance with applicable law and any applicable Employee Privacy Notice.
Other Details
International Data Transfers
We operate internationally, and as a result, will transfer Candidate Information across international borders, including from the UK, EEA, and/or Canada to the United States, for processing and storage. To the extent that Candidate Information is transferred from the UK or EEA to territories/countries for which the EU Commission and/or Secretary of State in the UK (as appropriate) has not made a finding that the legal framework in that territory/country provides adequate protection for individuals' rights and freedoms for their personal data, we will transfer such data consistent with applicable data protection laws, including through the use of the EU Commission-approved and/or Secretary of State in the UK approved (as appropriate) standard contractual clauses (as applicable). You can ask for a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out below.
In addition, we are committed to ensure that we comply with any additional requirements or guidelines from the European Court of Justice, data protection law and/or supervisory authorities in relation to the transfer of personal data.
California Candidates Data Protection Rights
The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA”, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, affords candidates residing in California certain rights with respect to their Candidate Information. If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.
We collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, the categories of Candidate Information listed in the below table from the sources identified in the “Information We Collect” section. For details about the precise data points we collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, please see the “Information We Collect” section above. We use and disclose the Candidate Information for the business and commercial purposes listed in the following table, and we disclose the Candidate Information to the recipients also listed in the following table.
We retain the categories of Candidate Information in accordance with the retention practices described above in
Our Retention Practices
.
Plaid does not (1) “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined by the CCPA) Candidate Information or (2) use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than what is specified in CCPA section 1798.121(a).
Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (a) request to know more about the sources of and the categories and specific pieces of Candidate Information we collect, use, and disclose and the categories of third parties to which we disclose such information, (b) request deletion of Candidate Information, (c) request correction of inaccurate Candidate Information, and (d) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. You may make these requests by emailing us at people-privacy@plaid.com completing this
webform
or calling (415) 799 - 1354. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your recent interactions with us, such as your phone number and email address. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
If we receive your request from an authorized agent who does not provide a valid power of attorney, we may ask the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request to exercise rights on your behalf. In the absence of a valid power of attorney, we may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or confirm to us that you otherwise provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please email us at
people-privacy@plaid.com

Nous pouvons également utiliser ou divulguer des informations agrégées, anonymisées ou anonymisées qui ne peuvent pas raisonnablement être utilisées pour vous identifier, dans la mesure autorisée par la loi applicable.
Nos bases légales pour le traitement (candidats au Royaume-Uni et dans l’EEE uniquement)
Pour les candidats au Royaume-Uni (« Royaume-Uni ») et dans l’Espace économique européen (« EEE »), notre base juridique pour la collecte, l’utilisation et le partage des Informations relatives au Candidat dépendra des informations concernées et du contexte dans lequel nous les avons collectées ou traitées. Toutefois, nous recueillerons et traiterons, en général, les Informations relatives au Candidat uniquement dans les cas suivants:
(a) nous devons nous conformer aux obligations légales qui nous sont applicables (comme les lois et réglementations applicables en matière d’immigration ou d’emploi);
(b) nous avons besoin des informations pour remplir nos responsabilités dans tout accord réel ou potentiel avec vous (tel qu’un contrat de travail ou une offre d’emploi si votre candidature est envisagée);
(c) le traitement est nécessaire pour nos intérêts légitimes et n’est pas outrepassé par vos intérêts en matière de protection des données ou vos droits et libertés fondamentaux (par exemple, pour assurer un environnement de travail sûr pour tous les membres de notre équipe), et pour assurer la fiabilité de nos candidats, et autrement administrer et traiter votre candidature ou pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre candidature; et
(d) nous disposons de votre consentement pour le faire (dans les cas où le consentement est réellement donné librement).
Lorsque nous sommes légalement autorisés ou tenus de collecter et de traiter des catégories particulières de données (par exemple, la race), nous traiterons alors uniquement ces informations:
lorsque nous devons raisonnablement le faire afin de nous conformer à nos obligations légales en tant qu’employeur potentiel;
lorsque nous devons le faire afin d’être informés de votre capacité de travail;
lorsque nous devons le faire pour protéger vos intérêts vitaux ou ceux d’une autre personne (et que nous ne sommes pas en mesure d’obtenir votre consentement); ou
lorsque vous nous avez donné votre consentement (dans les cas où votre consentement est réellement donné librement).
Dans la mesure où nous nous fondons sur le consentement pour collecter et traiter des Informations relatives au Candidat, vous êtes en droit de refuser de donner votre consentement ou de retirer votre consentement à tout moment en nous envoyant un courriel à l’adresse
people-privacy@plaid.com
. Le retrait de votre consentement n’affectera toutefois pas la légalité de tout traitement que nous avons effectué avant votre retrait, ni le traitement de vos données à caractère personnel à d’autres fins menées sur la base de motifs de traitement légaux autres que le consentement.
Nos pratiques de conservation
Nous conservons les Informations relatives au Candidat uniquement le temps nécessaire à la réalisation de la finalité pour laquelle elles ont été collectées et utilisées, conformément au présent Avis, à moins qu’une période de conservation plus longue ne soit requise ou autorisée par la loi applicable. Comme indiqué ci-dessus, cependant, si vous acceptez un emploi chez Plaid, vos Informations relatives au Candidat feront partie de votre dossier d’emploi et seront utilisées à des fins d’emploi conformément à la loi applicable et à tout Avis de confidentialité du personnel applicable.

We kunnen ook sollicitanteninformatie afleiden door een profiel aan te maken dat uw arbeidsvoorkeuren, eigenschappen, gedrag, intelligentie, capaciteiten en bekwaamheid weergeeft, bijvoorbeeld via notities die zijn gemaakt als onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.
We verzamelen de volgende categorieën sollicitanteninformatie over sollicitanten die we overwegen voor vacatures:

(indien en voor zover relevant voor een specifieke functie) informatie die nodig is om een antecedentenonderzoek uit te voeren
, bijvoorbeeld informatie die van u is verkregen of door middel van referentie- en antecedentenonderzoeken, onder voorbehoud van eventuele verdere toestemmingen of kennisgevingen die vereist en/of toegestaan zijn door de toepasselijke wetgeving, meestal door middel van het verstrekken van een officieel certificaat van goed gedrag (bijvoorbeeld in Nederland: Verklaring omtrent gedrag of VOG); en
informatie die nodig is om het dienstverband te starten
, inclusief bewijs van geschiktheid om in een bepaald land te werken (zoals een paspoort of visum), demografische informatie zoals uw geboortedatum en -plaats en staatsburgerschap, identificatiegegevens zoals uw burgerservicenummer (indien vereist en/of toegestaan door de wet), nationaal verzekeringsnummer, andere door de overheid uitgegeven identificatiemiddelen, belastingidentificatiegegevens en gerelateerde belastinginformatie (indien vereist en/of toegestaan door de wet) en bankrekeningnummers en gerelateerde informatie, informatie over het in aanmerking komen voor secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden en andere informatie die u verstrekt met het oog op het begin van het dienstverband of de uitvoering van een arbeidsovereenkomst.
Hoe we uw informatie gebruiken
We gebruiken de sollicitanteninformatie die over u zijn verzameld om uw sollicitatie te verwerken en om te voldoen aan wettelijke verplichtingen die we hebben met betrekking tot uw sollicitatie, inclusief het bevestigen van uw geschiktheid om op een bepaalde locatie te werken.
We gebruiken uw sollicitatiegegevens ook voor de volgende doeleinden:
het beheren en verwerken van uw sollicitatie

met u te communiceren over uw sollicitatie

, inclusief het verifiëren van uw identificatie, ervaring en andere informatie die u indient en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, alle sollicitatiegesprekinformatie en antecedentenonderzoeksinformatie;
uitvoeren van referentie- en antecedentenonderzoeken, inclusief strafbladcontroles, als onderdeel van uw sollicitatie
, onderworpen aan de toepasselijke wetgeving, inclusief het verifiëren van uw identificatie, ervaring en andere informatie die u indient en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, sollicitatiegesprekinformatie en antecedentenonderzoeksinformatie;

, zoals toegestaan door de toepasselijke wetgeving en alleen in bepaalde regio’s (zoals de VS), inclusief door het genereren van analyses met behulp van sollicitanteninformatie om te zorgen dat we een diverse reeks sollicitanten werven;
u informeren over carrièremogelijkheden
, waaronder andere vacatures waarvoor u eventueel in aanmerking komt; en

.
Houd er rekening mee dat als u een dienstverband bij Plaid accepteert, uw sollicitanteninformatie deel zullen uitmaken van uw arbeidsdossier en zullen worden gebruikt voor arbeidsdoeleinden in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving en elke toepasselijke privacyverklaring voor personeel. Als u echter niet wordt geaccepteerd voor een functie, kunnen we uw sollicitatie, inclusief relevante sollicitanteninformatie, nog steeds bewaren zodat we u kunnen overwegen voor andere carrièremogelijkheden bij Plaid en op voorwaarde dat, indien vereist door de toepasselijke wetgeving, we uw voorafgaande toestemming hebben verkregen voor een dergelijke langere bewaring van uw persoonsgegevens. Als u niet wilt dat uw informatie wordt bewaard indien u geen functie wordt aangeboden, waar van toepassing, raadpleeg dan de volgende secties hieronder voor opties die voor u beschikbaar kunnen zijn:
Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van sollicitanten in Californië
en
Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van Britse, EER- en Canadese sollicitanten
.
Plaid gebruikt uw persoonsgegevens niet voor geautomatiseerde individuele besluitvorming (inclusief profilering).
Hoe we uw informatie openbaar maken
We maken uw persoonsgegevens als volgt of zoals anderszins beschreven in deze verklaring aan anderen bekend:
aan Plaid en onze dochterondernemingen en gelieerde entiteiten
, aangezien de specifieke entiteit waarbij u solliciteert deel uitmaakt van een bredere groep bedrijven met hoofdkantoor in de Verenigde Staten en kantoren in verschillende rechtsgebieden die personeelszaken en IT-systemen delen voor het verwerken van uw sollicitatie, het beoordelen van uw geschiktheid voor de functie en het initiëren van een dienstverband (indien van toepassing);
aan onze gegevensverwerkers en andere dienstverleners
, waaronder onze leveranciers van diensten voor gegevensanalyse en antecedentenonderzoek en wervingsbureaus, in verband met de diensten die zij voor ons of namens ons verrichten. Indien vereist, zijn deze dienstverleners, partners of verkopers die namens ons handelen onderworpen aan contractuele verplichtingen om passende technische en organisatorische maatregelen te implementeren om de sollicitanteninformatie te beschermen, en om deze alleen volgens de instructies te verwerken.
aan wetshandhavingsinstanties, overheidsinstanties, regelgevende instanties en andere derden
, zoals rechtbanken en andere autoriteiten, onafhankelijke externe adviseurs en interne nalevings- en onderzoeksteams, als we denken dat een dergelijke openbaarmaking in overeenstemming is met of op een andere manier vereist is door toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of juridische procedures;
in verband met, of tijdens de onderhandelingen over, een fusie, verkoop van bedrijfsmiddelen, consolidatie of herstructurering, financiering of overname van het gehele of een deel van ons bedrijf door of in een ander bedrijf, voor zover toegestaan
, door de toepasselijke wetgeving;
indien nodig om Plaid te beschermen
, inclusief om potentiële, dreigende of feitelijke juridische vorderingen vast te stellen, uit te oefenen of te verdedigen;
om een contract met u af te dwingen of als wij van mening zijn dat uw acties niet in overeenstemming zijn met onze beleidslijnen
;
om te reageren op vorderingen, om onze rechten of de rechten van een derde partij te beschermen, om de veiligheid van een persoon te beschermen of om illegale activiteiten te voorkomen
; of
voor enig ander vermeld doel met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing
.
We kunnen ook geaggregeerde, geanonimiseerde of niet-identificeerbaar gemaakte informatie gebruiken of openbaar maken die niet redelijkerwijs kan worden gebruikt om u te identificeren, voor zover toegestaan volgens de toepasselijke wetgeving.
Onze wettelijke grondslagen voor verwerking (alleen voor sollicitanten uit het VK en de EER)
Voor sollicitanten in het Verenigd Koninkrijk (“VK”) en de Europese Economische Ruimte (“EER”), hangt onze rechtsgrond voor het verzamelen, gebruiken en doorgeven van sollicitanteninformatie af van de betreffende informatie en de context waarin we deze hebben verzameld of verwerkt. Normaal gesproken verzamelen en verwerken we echter in het algemeen alleen sollicitanteninformatie wanneer:
(a) we moeten voldoen aan wettelijke verplichtingen die op ons van toepassing zijn (zoals toepasselijke immigratie- en/of arbeidswet- en regelgeving);
(b) we de informatie nodig hebben om te voldoen aan onze verantwoordelijkheden in een feitelijke of toekomstige overeenkomst met u (zoals een arbeidsovereenkomst of een aanbod van werk als u in aanmerking komt voor een dienstverband);
(c) de verwerking noodzakelijk is voor onze rechtmatige belangen en niet wordt opgeheven door uw belangen op het gebied van gegevensbescherming of fundamentele rechten en vrijheden (zoals het garanderen van een veilige werkomgeving voor al onze teamleden en ter verzekering van de betrouwbaarheid van onze sollicitanten en voor het anderszins beheren en verwerken van uw sollicitatie, of om met u over uw sollicitatie te communiceren); en
(d) we uw toestemming hebben om dit te doen (in gevallen waarin uw toestemming geheel vrijelijk wordt gegeven).
Wanneer het ons wettelijk is toegestaan of we verplicht zijn om speciale categorieën gegevens te verzamelen en te verwerken (bijvoorbeeld ras), verwerken we dergelijke informatie alleen:
wanneer we dit redelijkerwijs moeten doen om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen als toekomstige werkgever;
wanneer we dit moeten doen om op de hoogte te worden gebracht van uw arbeidscapaciteit;
wanneer we dit moeten doen om de vitale belangen van u of een andere persoon te beschermen (en we uw toestemming niet kunnen verkrijgen); of
wanneer u ons uw toestemming hebt gegeven (in gevallen waarin uw toestemming geheel vrijelijk wordt gegeven).
Voor zover wij ons baseren op toestemming om sollicitanteninformatie te verzamelen en te verwerken, hebt u het recht om uw toestemming te weigeren of om uw toestemming op elk moment in te trekken door contact met ons op te nemen via
people-privacy@plaid.com
. Het intrekken van uw toestemming heeft echter geen invloed op de rechtmatigheid van de verwerking die wij voor uw intrekking hebben uitgevoerd, noch op de verwerking van uw persoonsgegevens voor andere doeleinden, uitgevoerd op grond van andere rechtmatige verwerkingsgronden dan toestemming.
Onze bewaarpraktijken
We bewaren sollicitanteninformatie niet langer dan nodig is om te voldoen aan het doel waarvoor deze is verzameld en gebruikt, zoals beschreven in deze verklaring, tenzij een langere bewaartermijn is vereist of toegestaan krachtens de toepasselijke wetgeving. Echter, zoals hierboven vermeld, als u een dienstverband bij Plaid accepteert, wordt uw sollicitanteninformatie een deel van uw arbeidsdossier en wordt gebruikt voor arbeidsdoeleinden in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving en eventuele toepasselijke privacyverklaring voor personeel.
Overige details
Internationale gegevensoverdrachten
We zijn internationaal actief en voeren daarom overdracht van sollicitanteninformatie uit over internationale grenzen, onder andere van het VK, de EER en/of Canada naar de Verenigde Staten voor verwerking en opslag. Voor zover sollicitanteninformatie wordt overgedragen van het VK of de EER naar gebieden/landen waarvoor de Europese Commissie en/of de minister van binnenlandse zaken in het VK (in voorkomend geval) niet heeft vastgesteld dat het wettelijke kader in dat gebied/land adequate bescherming biedt voor de rechten en vrijheden van personen voor hun persoonsgegevens, dragen we dergelijke gegevens over in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming, onder meer door het gebruik van door de Europese Commissie en/of de minister van binnenlandse zaken in het VK goedgekeurde (in voorkomend geval) standaardcontractbepalingen (indien van toepassing). U kunt om een kopie van deze standaardcontractbepalingen vragen door contact op te nemen zoals hieronder uiteengezet.
Daarnaast zetten we ons in om ervoor te zorgen dat we voldoen aan alle aanvullende voorschriften of richtlijnen van het Europees Hof van Justitie, de wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming en/of toezichthoudende autoriteiten met betrekking tot de overdracht van persoonsgegevens.
Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van sollicitanten in Californië
De California Consumer Privacy Act of “CCPA”, zoals gewijzigd door de California Privacy Rights Act, biedt sollicitanten die in Californië wonen bepaalde rechten met betrekking tot hun sollicitanteninformatie. Als u inwoner van Californië bent, is dit gedeelte op u van toepassing.
We verzamelen of hebben in de afgelopen 12 maanden de categorieën sollicitanteninformatie verzameld die in de onderstaande tabel worden vermeld uit de bronnen die worden geïdentificeerd in het gedeelte “Informatie die we verzamelen”. Voor details over de precieze gegevenspunten die we verzamelen of in de afgelopen 12 maanden hebben verzameld, raadpleeg dan het gedeelte “Informatie die we verzamelen” hierboven. We gebruiken en maken de sollicitanteninformatie bekend voor de zakelijke en commerciële doeleinden die in de volgende tabel worden vermeld en we maken de sollicitanteninformatie bekend aan de ontvangers die ook in de volgende tabel worden vermeld.
We bewaren de categorieën sollicitanteninformatie in overeenstemming met de hierboven beschreven bewaarpraktijken in
Onze bewaarpraktijken
.
Plaid (1) “verkoopt” geen sollicitanteninformatie en “geeft” deze niet “door” en (2) gebruikt of maakt gevoelige persoonlijke informatie niet openbaar voor enig ander doel dan wat wordt gespecificeerd in CCPA-sectie 1798.121(a) (zoals deze termen worden gedefinieerd door de CCPA).
Onder voorbehoud van bepaalde beperkingen hebt u het recht om (a) te verzoeken om meer te weten te komen over de bronnen van en de categorieën en specifieke stukjes sollicitanteninformatie die we verzamelen, gebruiken en openbaar maken en de categorieën derden aan wie we dergelijke informatie bekendmaken, (b) te verzoeken om verwijdering van sollicitanteninformatie, (c) te verzoeken om correctie van onjuiste sollicitanteninformatie, en (d) niet te worden gediscrimineerd voor het uitoefenen van deze rechten. U kunt deze verzoeken indienen door een e-mail te sturen naar people-privacy@plaid.com, dit
webformulier
in te vullen of te bellen naar +1 (415) 799 - 1354. We zullen uw verzoek verifiëren door u te vragen informatie te verstrekken met betrekking tot uw recente interacties met ons, zoals uw telefoonnummer en e-mailadres. We discrimineren u niet als u uw rechten krachtens de CCPA uitoefent.
Als we uw verzoek ontvangen van een gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger die geen geldige volmacht verstrekt, kunnen we de gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger vragen om bewijs te leveren dat u de vertegenwoordiger ondertekende toestemming hebt gegeven om het verzoek in te dienen om namens u rechten uit te oefenen. Bij gebrek aan een geldige volmacht kunnen we u ook vragen om uw eigen identiteit rechtstreeks bij ons te verifiëren of aan ons te bevestigen dat u anderszins de gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger toestemming hebt gegeven om het verzoek in te dienen. Als u een gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger bent die een verzoek wil indienen, stuur dan een e-mail naar
people-privacy@plaid.com
.
Gegevensbeschermingsrechten voor sollicitanten in het VK, de EER en Canada
Krachtens de toepasselijke wetgeving hebt u bepaalde rechten met betrekking tot uw sollicitanteninformatie. Deze rechten kunnen per land en provincie verschillen.
Onderhevig aan bepaalde beperkingen en uitzonderingen, omvatten die rechten het recht om: (i) te weten of we persoonsgegevens over u verwerken; (ii) toegang te vragen tot of rectificatie van de persoonsgegevens die we over u verwerken; (iii) bezwaar te maken tegen, of te verzoeken dat we de verwerking van uw persoonsgegevens beperken; (iv) ons te verzoeken persoonsgegevens over u te verwijderen; (v) te verzoeken dat wij de persoonsgegevens die u aan ons hebt verstrekt, verstrekken in een gestructureerd, algemeen gebruikt en machinaal leesbaar formaat, voor verzending naar een andere verwerkingsverantwoordelijke; (vi) uw toestemming op elk moment in te trekken wanneer onze verwerking gebaseerd is op uw toestemming; en (vii) een klacht in te dienen bij uw lokale toezichthoudende autoriteit (als u in het VK bent, raadpleeg dan deze
pagina
voor contactinformatie voor het Britse Information Commissioner’s Office en als u in de EER bent, raadpleeg dan deze
pagina
voor contactinformatie voor toezichthoudende instanties van de EU).
Als u uw rechten wilt uitoefenen, neem dan contact met ons op via de onderstaande contactinformatie.
We geven u graag op uw verzoek een meer gedetailleerd overzicht van onze relevante verwerkingsdoeleinden (evenals de gerelateerde categorieën gegevens, bewaartermijnen en wettelijke verwerkingsgronden).

We kunnen deze privacyverklaring voor sollicitanten van tijd tot tijd wijzigen. Als we wijzigingen aanbrengen, veranderen we de ingangsdatum bovenaan deze verklaring.

Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten wie folgt oder wie ansonsten in dieser Erklärung beschrieben an andere weiter:

Soweit erforderlich sind diese Dienstleister, Partner oder Anbieter, die in unserem Namen handeln, vertraglich verpflichtet, angemessene technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Bewerberinformationen zu ergreifen und dürfen diese nur nach Anweisung verarbeiten,
an Strafverfolgungsbehörden, Regierungsbehörden, Aufsichtsbehörden und andere Drittanbieter
, wie z. B. Gerichte und andere Behörden, unabhängige externe Berater und interne Compliance- und Untersuchungsteams, wenn eine solche Weitergabe nach unserer Auffassung im Einklang mit maßgeblichen Gesetzen, Vorschriften oder gerichtlichen Verfügungen geschieht oder ansonsten von diesen vorgeschrieben ist,

um Verträge mit Ihnen durchzusetzen oder wenn wir annehmen, dass Ihre Vorgehensweisen nicht mit unseren Richtlinien vereinbar sind
;
um auf Forderungen zu reagieren, um unsere Rechte oder die Rechte eines Drittanbieters zu schützen, um die Sicherheit von Personen zu schützen oder um illegale Aktivitäten zu verhindern
; oder
für jeden anderen mitgeteilten Zweck, sei es mit Ihrer Zustimmung oder auf Ihre Anweisung
.
Wir können außerdem aggregierte, anonymisierte oder de-identifizierte Informationen verwenden oder weitergeben, die ohne großen Aufwand nicht dazu verwendet werden können, um Sie zu identifizieren, soweit dies nach geltendem Recht zulässig ist.
Unsere Rechtsgrundlagen für die Verarbeitung (nur Bewerber aus dem Vereinigten Königreich und dem EWR)
Bei Bewerbern im Vereinigten Königreich (United Kingdom, „UK”) und im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR”) hängt unsere Rechtsgrundlage für die Erfassung, Verwendung und Weitergabe von Bewerberinformationen von den betreffenden Daten und dem Kontext ab, in dem wir sie erfasst oder verarbeitet haben. Grundsätzlich gilt jedoch, dass wir Bewerberinformationen nur dann erfassen und verarbeiten werden, wenn:
(a) wir die für uns geltenden rechtlichen Verpflichtungen erfüllen müssen (z. B. geltende Einwanderungs- und/oder Arbeitsgesetze und -vorschriften),
(b) wir die Informationen benötigen, um unseren Verpflichtungen aus existierenden oder potenziellen Vereinbarungen mit Ihnen nachzukommen (wie z. B. einem Arbeitsvertrag oder einem Beschäftigungsangebot, wenn Sie für eine Beschäftigung in Betracht gezogen werden),
(c) die Verarbeitung für unsere berechtigten Interessen erforderlich ist und Ihre Datenschutzinteressen oder Grundrechte und -freiheiten nicht überwiegen (z. B. um ein sicheres Arbeitsumfeld für alle unsere Teammitglieder und die Vertrauenswürdigkeit unserer Bewerber sicherzustellen und im Übrigen Ihr Bewerbung zu verwalten und zu bearbeiten oder mit Ihnen wegen Ihrer Bewerbung in Kontakt zu treten) und
(d) wir Ihre diesbezügliche Einwilligung eingeholt haben (in Fällen, in denen Ihre Einwilligung wirklich freiwillig gegeben wird).
Wenn es uns nach geltendem Recht erlaubt oder vorgeschrieben ist, spezielle Datenkategorien (z. B. ethnische Zugehörigkeit) zu erfassen und zu verarbeiten, werden diese Informationen von uns nur verarbeitet,
wenn wir dies vernünftigerweise tun müssen, um unseren gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen als potenzieller Arbeitgeber nachzukommen,
wenn wir dies tun müssen, um über Ihre Arbeitsfähigkeit informiert zu sein,
wenn wir dies tun müssen, um Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die einer anderen Person zu schützen (und wir nicht in der Lage sind, Ihre Einwilligung einzuholen), oder
wenn Sie uns Ihre Einwilligung gegeben haben (in Fällen, in denen Ihre Einwilligung wirklich freiwillig gegeben wurde).
Soweit wir uns auf eine Einwilligung zur Erhebung und Verarbeitung von Bewerberinformationen stützen, haben Sie das Recht, Ihre Einwilligung zu verweigern oder jederzeit zu widerrufen, indem Sie uns per E-Mail an
people-privacy@plaid.com
kontaktieren. Der Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung hat jedoch keinen Einfluss auf die Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung, die wir vor Ihrem Widerruf durchgeführt haben, und auch nicht auf die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, die auf der Grundlage anderer rechtmäßiger Verarbeitungsgründe als der Einwilligung für andere Zwecke stattgefunden hat.
Unsere Aufbewahrungspraktiken
Wir bewahren Bewerberinformationen nur so lange auf, wie es für die Erfüllung des Zwecks, für den sie erhoben und genutzt wurden, erforderlich ist, wie in dieser Erklärung beschrieben, es sei denn, eine längere Aufbewahrungsfrist ist nach geltendem Recht erforderlich oder zulässig. Wenn Sie eine Beschäftigung bei Plaid annehmen, werden Ihre Bewerberinformationen, wie bereits zuvor angesprochen, jedoch Teil Ihrer Beschäftigungsakte und für Beschäftigungszwecke im Einklang mit geltendem Recht und allen maßgeblichen Datenschutzerklärungen für Mitarbeiter verwendet.
Andere Hinweise
Internationale Datenübermittlung
Wir sind international tätig und übermitteln Bewerberinformationen daher über internationale Grenzen hinweg, einschließlich aus dem UK, dem EWR und/oder aus Kanada in die Vereinigten Staaten, um sie zu verarbeiten und zu speichern. Soweit Bewerberinformationen aus dem UK oder dem EWR in Gebiete/Länder übermittelt werden, für die die EU-Kommission und/oder das britische Außenministerium (je nach Sachlage) nicht festgestellt hat, dass der Rechtsrahmen in diesem Gebiet/Land einen angemessenen Schutz der Rechte und Freiheiten natürlicher Personen in Bezug auf ihre personenbezogenen Daten bietet, werden wir diese Daten im Einklang mit den geltenden Datenschutzgesetzen übermitteln, unter anderem durch die Verwendung der von der EU-Kommission und/oder dem britischen Außenministerium (je nach Sachlage) genehmigten Standardvertragsklauseln (falls zutreffend). Sie können eine Kopie dieser Standardvertragsklauseln anfordern, wenn Sie uns wie unten beschrieben kontaktieren.
Darüber hinaus verpflichten wir uns, sicherzustellen, dass wir alle zusätzlichen Anforderungen oder Leitlinien des Europäischen Gerichtshofs, des Datenschutzgesetzes und/oder der Aufsichtsbehörden in Bezug auf die Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten einhalten.
Datenschutzrechte von Bewerbern in Kalifornien
Das kalifornische Gesetz zum Schutz der Daten von Verbrauchern (California Consumer Privacy Act, „CCPA”) in der durch das kalifornische Datenschutzgesetz geänderten Fassung gewährt Bewerbern mit Wohnsitz in Kalifornien bestimmte Rechte in Bezug auf ihre Bewerberinformationen. Wenn Sie in Kalifornien ansässig sind, gilt dieser Abschnitt für Sie.
Wir beziehen bzw. haben in den letzten 12 Monaten die in der nachstehenden Tabelle aufgeführten Kategorien von Bewerberinformationen erhoben, und zwar von Quellen, die im Abschnitt „Informationen, die wir erfassen” genannt werden. Einzelheiten zu den genauen Datenpunkten, die wir beziehen bzw. in den letzten 12 Monaten bezogen haben, finden Sie im vorstehenden Abschnitt „Informationen, die wir erfassen”. Die Bewerberinformationen werden von uns für die in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführten geschäftlichen und kommerziellen Zwecke verwendet und weitergegeben, und wir geben diese Informationen an die Empfänger weiter, die ebenfalls in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführt sind.
Wir bewahren die Kategorien von Bewerberinformationen im Einklang mit den oben in
Unsere Aufbewahrungspraktiken
beschriebenen Aufbewahrungspraktiken auf.
Plaid (1) „verkauft” oder „teilt” (im Sinne der Definition dieser Begriffe im CCPA) keine Bewerberinformationen und (2) verwendet keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten für andere Zwecke als die in Paragraf 1798.121(a) des CCPA angegebenen und gibt sie auch nicht für andere Zwecke weiter.
Vorbehaltlich bestimmter Einschränkungen haben Sie das Recht, (a) mehr über die Quellen sowie die Kategorien und spezifischen Teile von Bewerberinformationen, die wir erheben, verwenden und weitergeben, und die Kategorien von Dritten, an die wir solche Informationen weitergeben, zu erfahren, (b) die Löschung von Bewerberinformationen zu verlangen, (c) die Korrektur ungenauer Bewerberinformationen zu verlangen und (d) wegen der Ausübung dieser Rechte nicht diskriminiert zu werden. Sie können diese Anträge stellen, indem Sie uns eine E-Mail an people-privacy@plaid.com senden, dieses
Webformular
ausfüllen oder unter der Nummer +1-415-799-1354 anrufen. Wir werden Ihre Anträge überprüfen, indem wir Sie bitten, uns Informationen zu Ihren kürzlich erfolgten Interaktionen mit uns zu liefern, wie z. B. Ihre Telefonnummer und E-Mail-Adresse. Wir werden Sie nicht unangemessen benachteiligen, wenn Sie Ihre Rechte aus dem CCPA ausüben.
Wenn wir Ihren Antrag von einem bevollmächtigten Vertreter erhalten, der keine gültige Vollmacht vorlegt, können wir den Vertreter auffordern, den Nachweis dafür zu erbringen, dass Sie ihm eine unterzeichnete Erlaubnis erteilt haben, den Antrag zur Ausübung von Rechten in Ihrem Namen einzureichen. In Ermangelung einer gültigen Vollmacht können wir auch Sie auffordern, Ihre eigene Identität direkt bei uns zu verifizieren oder uns andernfalls zu bestätigen, dass Sie dem bevollmächtigten Vertreter die Erlaubnis erteilt haben, den Antrag einzureichen. Wenn Sie ein bevollmächtigter Vertreter sind, der einen Antrag stellen möchte, senden Sie uns bitte eine E-Mail an
people-privacy@plaid.com
.
Datenschutzrechte von Bewerbern im UK, im EWR und in Kanada
Nach geltendem Recht stehen Ihnen bestimmte Rechte in Bezug auf Ihre Bewerberinformationen zu. Diese Rechte können je nach Land und Provinz variieren.
Vorbehaltlich bestimmter Einschränkungen und Ausnahmen beinhalten diese Rechte das Recht auf Folgendes: (i) zu erfahren, ob wir personenbezogene Daten über Sie verarbeiten, (ii) Zugang zu den personenbezogenen Daten, die wir über Sie verarbeiten, oder deren Berichtigung zu verlangen, (iii) der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu widersprechen oder zu verlangen, dass wir diese einschränken, (iv) zu verlangen, dass wir personenbezogene Daten über Sie löschen, (v) zu verlangen, dass wir die personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung gestellt haben, in einem strukturierten, gebräuchlichen und maschinenlesbaren Format zur Übermittlung an einen anderen Verantwortlichen bereitstellen, (vi) die Einwilligung jederzeit zu widerrufen, wenn unsere Verarbeitung auf Ihrer Einwilligung beruht, und (vii) eine Beschwerde bei Ihrer lokalen Aufsichtsbehörde einzureichen (wenn Sie im UK ansässig sind, finden Sie auf dieser

Your data will be stored no longer than three years, unless required by law.

Unsere Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung der von uns erhobenen Daten hängt davon ab, welche Daten wir erhoben haben und in welchem Kontext wir sie verarbeiten.

Wie wir Ihre Daten weitergeben

Hartelijk dank dat u Plaid gebruikt! We hopen dat u de tijd neemt om deze Privacyverklaring zorgvuldig te lezen.
Deze Privacyverklaring zet de manieren uiteen waarop Plaid Inc. en haar dochterondernemingen, waaronder Plaid Financial Ltd., Plaid Consumer Reporting Agency, Inc. en Plaid, B.V. (gezamenlijk “Plaid”, “we/wij”, “onze” en “ons”) gegevens over u (d.w.z. de ontwikkelaar, klant, websitebezoeker) verzamelen, gebruiken en delen wanneer u de websites van Plaid bezoekt of gebruikt, onze producten en diensten gebruikt in uw softwaretoepassing opneemt of anderszins met ons communiceert (bijvoorbeeld wanneer u een klantenservice-aanvraag doet of een Plaid-evenement of webinar bijwoont). Deze Privacyverklaring is niet van toepassing op gegevens die we verzamelen over eindgebruikers wanneer ze hun financiële rekeningen via Plaid koppelen aan een app of op de gegevens die worden gebruikt om een Plaid CRA-consumentenrapport te maken.

Hoe wij omgaan met gegevens
Gegevens die we verzamelen en categorieën bronnen
Gegevens die u aan ons verstrekt
. We verzamelen de gegevens die u rechtstreeks aan Plaid verstrekt. U verstrekt bijvoorbeeld persoonsgegevens wanneer u een ontwikkelaarsaccount aanmaakt, ons ‘contactformulier’ invult, zich aanmeldt voor onze e-mails, klantenondersteuning aanvraagt, zich inschrijft voor facturering, of anderszins met ons communiceert. De soorten gegevens die we verzamelen zijn onder andere:
identificatiegegevens (zoals volledige naam, e-mailadres, postadres, telefoonnummer en geboortedatum),
gevoelige gegevens (zoals een rijbewijsnummer en fiscaal identificatienummer, financiële rekeninginformatie en burgerservicenummers, waar nodig om diensten te verlenen),
beroepsgegevens (zoals een bedrijfsnaam en -titel), en
alle andere persoonsgegevens die u verstrekt (waaronder bijvoorbeeld in ondersteuningsberichten voor ontwikkelaars).
We kunnen ook bepaalde documentatie verzamelen die uw foto bevat of we kunnen van u eisen dat u uw identiteit verifieert door een foto of video van uzelf te verstrekken. Gegevens die in dit verband worden verzameld, kunnen in sommige staten of landen als biometrische gegevens worden beschouwd, zoals hieronder vermeld. Zie hieronder de speciale kennisgeving voor inwoners van Illinois en Texas.
Speciale biometrische gegevensverklaring voor inwoners van Illinois en Texas
Voor inwoners van Illinois of Texas, als we vereisen dat u ons een document verstrekt met uw foto of als u uw identiteit moet verifiëren door een foto of video van uzelf te verstrekken, kunnen de gegevens die zijn afgeleid van uw gezicht die wij en onze dienstverleners namens ons verzamelen en verwerken, op sommige plaatsen worden beschouwd als biometrische gegevens. Uw gegevens worden niet langer dan drie jaar bewaard, tenzij wettelijk vereist.
Gegevens die we ontvangen wanneer u onze technologie test
. Soms gebruiken mensen die toepassingen bouwen met behulp van onze diensten hun eigen inloggegevens voor hun bankrekening of andere financiële rekening om te testen en te evalueren hoe onze technologie in hun toepassing zal verschijnen en functioneren. Als u dit doet, moet u ons
Privacybeleid voor eindgebruikers
lezen voor details over hoe we die gegevens verzamelen en verwerken.
Gegevens die we verzamelen wanneer u gebruikmaakt van onze diensten
. Wanneer u gebruikmaakt van onze diensten, verzamelen we de volgende gegevens over u:
Loggegevens
: We verzamelen logbestanden wanneer u onze diensten gebruikt. Dit omvat identificatoren en elektronische informatie over netwerkactiviteiten, zoals het type browser dat u gebruikt, wanneer u onze diensten opent, de bekeken pagina’s en uw IP-adres.
Geschatte locatie
: We bepalen bij benadering de locatie van het apparaat dat u gebruikt om toegang te krijgen tot onze diensten vanaf uw IP-adres of tijdzone-instelling op uw apparaat.
Gegevens verzameld door cookies en andere trackingtechnologieën
: We gebruiken verschillende technologieën zoals cookies en webbakens in onze diensten om persoonsgegevens te verzamelen. Cookies zijn kleine gegevensbestanden die door uw webbrowser, op uw harde schijf of in het geheugen van uw apparaat worden opgeslagen en die ons helpen onze Diensten en uw ervaring te verbeteren, het gebruik van onze Diensten te bepalen en potentieel schadelijk gedrag te controleren en te detecteren. Webbakens zijn elektronische afbeeldingen die worden gebruikt in onze Diensten of e-mails en helpen bij het leveren van cookies. Webbakens tellen hoe vaak een webpagina wordt bezocht en helpen ons te begrijpen hoe onze Dienst wordt gebruikt en helpen ons onze Dienst te verbeteren.
Houd er rekening mee dat we cookies van derden kunnen gebruiken voor onze advertentiedoeleinden, zoals toegestaan door de wet en zoals verder beschreven in ons
Cookiebeleid
. Om uw cookie-instellingen en -voorkeuren te wijzigen, inclusief die voor targeting- en advertentiecookies, klikt u op de link Cookievoorkeuren in de voettekst van de pagina.
Gegevens die we verzamelen uit andere bronnen
. Wij verzamelen ook gegevens over u uit andere bronnen. We kunnen bijvoorbeeld gegevens verzamelen van andere leden van uw bedrijf en van leveranciers die ons helpen nieuwe zakelijke klanten te identificeren, waaronder uw naam, e-mailadres en URL van uw sociale media-profiel.
Hoe we uw gegevens gebruiken
We gebruiken de gegevens die we verzamelen voor de volgende zakelijke en commerciële doeleinden:
voor het exploiteren, verbeteren en ontwikkelen van onze diensten;
Om uw identiteit te verifiëren;
Om ontwikkelaars te factureren voor onze diensten en hen te betalen;
Om te voldoen aan de wet, zoals het doen van belastingaangiftes;
Om u zaken te sturen zoals technische kennisgevingen, updates, beveiligingswaarschuwingen en berichten over uw account;
Om te reageren op uw opmerkingen, vragen en verzoeken om klantenservice;
Om uw ervaring met onze diensten persoonlijker te maken;
Om met u te communiceren over producten, diensten, aanbiedingen en Plaid-evenementen die wij aanbieden of sponsoren;
Om trends, gebruik en activiteiten in verband met onze diensten te monitoren en te analyseren;
Om fraude, kwaadaardige activiteiten en andere illegale activiteiten op te sporen en te voorkomen;
Om de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendom van Plaid en anderen te beschermen; en
Voor andere doeleinden waarover we u informeren vóór of op het moment dat we de gegevens verzamelen.
Onze wettelijke grondslagen voor verwerking in de EER en het VK
Plaid verwerkt uw persoonsgegevens alleen wanneer we een geldige rechtsgrond hebben om dit te doen. Onze rechtsgrond voor het verwerken van de gegevens die we verzamelen, hangt af van het soort gegevens dat we hebben verzameld en de context voor het verwerken ervan. Over het algemeen verzamelen en verwerken we alleen gegevens wanneer:
we moeten voldoen aan onze verantwoordelijkheden en verplichtingen in een contract of overeenkomst met u;
om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen volgens toepasselijk recht;
indien de verwerking noodzakelijk is in verband met onze gerechtvaardigde belangen, en uw gegevensbeschermingsrechten of fundamentele rechten en vrijheden niet zwaarder wegen dan die belangen (bijvoorbeeld om onze diensten te kunnen verlenen of actualiseren); en
u hiervoor uw toestemming hebt gegeven.
Hoe we uw gegevens delen
We delen gegevens over u als volgt:
Met andere bedrijven of personen zoals dienstverleners, aannemers of zakenpartners om diensten voor ons te verlenen en ons bedrijf te helpen ondersteunen. We delen ook gegevens met incassobureaus in het geval van achterstallige betalingen van onze ontwikkelaars.
Als we te goeder trouw geloven dat openbaarmaking gepast is om te voldoen aan de toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of juridische procedures (zoals een gerechtelijk bevel of dagvaarding). Dit omvat openbaarmaking in verband met verzoeken van wetshandhavingsinstanties of andere overheidsinstanties;
Als wij van mening zijn dat uw handelingen niet in overeenstemming zijn met onze overeenkomsten of beleidslijnen, of om de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendom van Plaid of anderen te beschermen;
In het geval van een verandering in eigendom of controle van ons hele bedrijf of een deel daarvan (zoals een fusie, overname, reorganisatie of faillissement);
Tussen Plaid en onze huidige en toekomstige moedermaatschappijen, gelieerde ondernemingen, dochterondernemingen en andere bedrijven onder gezamenlijke controle of eigendom; en
Met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing.
We verzamelen, gebruiken en delen ook gegevens die zijn geaggregeerd en geanonimiseerd op een manier die niet kan worden gebruikt om u te identificeren, voor enig doel dat is toegestaan onder de toepasselijke wetgeving.
We delen mogelijk persoonsgegevens met derden of staan hen toe persoonsgegevens te verzamelen van onze sites of diensten, zoals hierboven beschreven.
In deze tabel wordt uitgelegd hoe we in de afgelopen 12 maanden persoonsgegevens hebben verzameld en gedeeld:

Chatbots, advertenties, analyse- en andere diensten geleverd door derden
We staan derden, waaronder Google Analytics, toe om analysediensten en advertenties op onze websites te leveren. Deze derden gebruiken cookies, webbakens en andere technologieën om gegevens over u te verzamelen. Plaid gebruikt chatbots die worden aangedreven door externe dienstverleners. Houd er rekening mee dat als u persoonsgegevens aan onze chatbot verstrekt, uw gegevens kunnen worden gedeeld met de externe dienstverlener om de chatbot te ondersteunen.

Internationale gegevensoverdrachten
We kunnen de gegevens die we over u verzamelen, overdragen naar andere landen dan het land waarin u woont voor verwerking en opslag. Als we gegevens overdragen naar een land of gebied dat niet wordt geacht privacy- en gegevensbeschermingswetten te hebben die gelijk zijn aan die van uw land, zullen we dergelijke gegevens overdragen in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke gegevensbeschermingswetten. In het bijzonder kunnen we gebruikmaken van door de Europese Commissie goedgekeurde of door de Britse Secretary of State goedgekeurde (indien van toepassing) standaardcontractbepalingen, indien nodig in combinatie met aanvullende waarborgen. U kunt om een kopie van deze standaardcontractbepalingen vragen door contact op te nemen zoals hieronder uiteengezet.

What Are Cookies
Cookies are small data files stored on your browser or device, which can be in the form of session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) or persistent cookies (which stay on your browser for a set period of time or until you delete them).

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
Introduction
At Plaid, we are committed to a set of core principles: Impact; Grow together; Embrace openness and positivity; Think rigorously, act with urgency; Make it better; Consumer outcomes via customer love; and Invent tomorrow. In accordance with our core principles, Plaid is committed to ensuring there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our businesses and supply chains.
In compliance with its obligation under s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the
"2015 Act"
), this statement sets out the steps Plaid Inc. has taken in the last financial year to ensure modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any parts of its business or in any of its supply chains. This statement covers the steps taken by Plaid Inc. and all of its group subsidiaries, including Plaid Financial Ltd. and Plaid, B.V. (collectively,
"Plaid"
and
“our”
). Although covered by this statement, we note that Plaid Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Plaid Financial Ltd., does not have an obligation itself to make a transparency in supply statement pursuant to s.54 of the 2015 Act.
Our business
Plaid provides technical infrastructure application programming interfaces (
"APIs"
) to companies that develop digital financial applications (
"apps"
) and services to enable consumers and businesses (together,
“end users”
) to share data from their financial accounts with the apps and services. These apps and services help end users do things like save for retirement, manage their spending, streamline loan applications, or transfer money.
Plaid is a leading provider in the UK, Europe and North America, connecting over 4,500 apps and services to more than 11,000 financial institutions.
Plaid is headquartered in San Francisco, California and has over 600 team members across 6 offices in the US, Europe and the UK.
In the UK, Plaid is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (Firm Reference Number: 804718) for the provision of payment services.
Our supply chains
As a technology company, Plaid's substantive supply chains are relatively short, and mostly comprised of organisations Plaid uses on an on-going basis for services such as Software as a Service (
"SaaS"
) or client installable software. In accordance with our Vendor Management Policy introduced in 28 May 2019 and most recently updated 26 June 2020, during last financial year, we have continued to undertake an on-boarding review of new vendors as well as ongoing monitoring of critical vendors to ensure they are complying with their contractual commitments and not otherwise breaching applicable law. Plaid’s relationship with a vendor may be adjusted or terminated in the event that the monitoring reveals deficiencies or material risks that are unacceptable to Plaid. This would include any identified risk of modern slavery or human trafficking. We have not identified any potential modern slavery or human trafficking issues to date in our supply chains.
Our policies and contractual controls
Plaid strictly complies with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal policies and procedures, including our Code of Business Conduct (
"the Code"
), to ensure we act professionally, transparently and with integrity at all times.
The Code exists to help make clear what we expect of our team members, and to make sure that Plaid continues to be a company that others want to do business with and that our team members are proud to be part of. All team members, as well as those doing business with Plaid, must abide by and follow this Code, which covers the laws we must obey and offers guidance for navigating the complexities of doing business on a global scale.
In relation to human trafficking the Code states "The United States Government has a zero-tolerance policy regarding trafficking in persons. It goes without saying that Plaid strictly prohibits team members from soliciting or engaging in: (a) prostitution, (b) trafficking in persons, and (c) forced labor. Plaid will take appropriate disciplinary action — including, but not limited to, termination — against anyone who violates this prohibition. Team members are also under an affirmative obligation to timely report any information received from any source potentially constituting a violation of this policy."
Plaid staff are required to read and sign an 'Acknowledgement of Receipt and Review' to confirm they received a copy of the Code and understand and will act in accordance with the rules, policies and procedures in the Code. The Code has continued to apply during the last financial year. It is reviewed and updated (as needed) on an annual basis and was last reviewed and updated on 8 June 2020. Compliance with the Code should, amongst other things, help reduce the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in the Plaid business and its supply chains.
Risk assessment and due diligence
Plaid is not aware of any slavery or human trafficking issues within its group businesses or supply chains. In the last financial year, no potential issues of this type have been identified or reported through internal reporting channels (such as Plaid's procedures for reporting suspected violations, illegal or unethical behavior outlined in the Code), audit processes, other whistleblowing channels or otherwise. Plaid Inc. has not received any information from any of the entities in the Plaid group indicating that there may be any such issues with any of its intra-group suppliers or their supply chains.
Reflecting upon the position as set out above, we consider the risk of slavery or human trafficking in Plaid, and its supply chain continues to be low. However, should any potential issue be identified, Plaid will act swiftly to investigate and, where necessary, act to ensure there is no modern slavery or human trafficking occurring in its business or supply chains.
Next steps
Plaid is committed to continuing to prevent slavery or human trafficking in its business and supply chain.
Approval of this statement
This statement is made in compliance with Plaid Inc.'s obligations under s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ending December 31, 2020. This statement was approved by Plaid Inc. on 30 April 2021.
