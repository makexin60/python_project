Garmin Jr.
Your Privacy Matters to Garmin
Our goal is to make sure you know how we collect, use, share, and store you and your child’s personal data when you use the Garmin Jr. application ("Garmin Jr. app").
What personal data does Garmin collect?
The Garmin Jr. app was created to help your child track their activities, chores, and even gain rewards — all while exploring new adventures. We ask for personal data — such as your name, email address, family name, your children's names, location, and other information — so you can sign in to your account, receive personalized support, monitor your children's activities, receive important safety information about your devices, and get the most out of our products and apps.

When You Make a Garmin Account
Garmin stores information such as your name, email address, and password so you can sign in. It also helps us verify your account if you call customer support.
When You Create a Garmin Jr. App Family Profile
We use your Garmin Connect name as your admin name for your profile. We also ask for your family name and names for the children you add to your profile. However, you don’t have to use any real names. If you want to be the Smiths, that works for us. If you want your children’s names to be Thing 1 and Thing 2, no problem. We also ask you to provide display text for each of your children's devices, which can be any text you wish. You can add photos of your children, their birthdays, and their genders to your family profile, but you don’t have to.
We set default sleep and wake times so you can monitor your children's sleep. You have the option to change it if you want, but you don’t have to. It’s the same with your location and your children's birthdays and genders. It’s all optional, based on how you want to use the app.
When Your Child Uses the Toe-to-Toe Challenge Feature
When your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe step challenge, the display text you chose for your child’s device will be displayed on the device of the child they’re competing with and in the app of that child's parent or guardian.
When You Challenge Other Families
We use your admin name and family name to help you find Connections and other families you want to compete with. During a challenge, your name, the names you use for your children in your profile, and the total steps for you and each family member will be displayed in the app of the other family’s admin.
When You Invite a Second Parent or Guardian
You may choose to invite another parent or guardian to help monitor your children's activities, chores, and rewards. We’ll ask for that guardian’s name and email so they can be invited to join your family.
When You Use Location Features
If your child’s device is configured to use location-based features such as live tracking and geofencing, your child’s location data is transmitted to the Garmin Jr. app, but you have control over who sees it from there.
When You Sync Devices
When you sync your child’s device with the Garmin Jr. app, your child’s activities, chores, rewards, and sleep times will be uploaded to Garmin, and you can monitor their progress. If you don’t want to do that, just refrain from syncing with the app.
We also collect data such as your IP address, sync time and date and battery level to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues and to provide better customer support.
When You Contact Garmin
We know you might want to stay off the grid, but we may collect things such as your contact, device, or subscription information during support calls to ensure that you get the help you need.

Data Shared Within Garmin
Garmin is global, which means that Garmin has companies all over the world that work together to provide our products/services and support our business. No matter which Garmin company handles your information, it is still secured under this privacy policy.
Data Shared with Service Providers
We share personal data with third parties who provide services — such as analytics and hosting services and sending emails to customers — for us.
Data Shared for Legal Reasons
We will share your personal data when required to by law enforcement and in other legal matters.
View Full Privacy Policy
How can you share your personal data?
Your child’s personal data belongs to the child, legal guardians and/or caregivers, and those users control what is shared and with whom it’s shared.
Learn More
Steps and Activities
Your children's activity data is automatically set to private when you upload it to Garmin. When your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe step challenge, their display text and total steps during the challenge will be displayed on the other child’s device and in the app of that child's parent or guardian. Your name and steps and those of the family members in your profile will be shown to other families when you engage in challenges with them.
Garmin Jr. App Community
Other Garmin Jr. app users will be able to see your family name, admin name, the names of any added parents or guardians, and the number of children on your profile. Your Connections will be able to see the same information plus the names you provided for the children in your profile.

Privacy Policy for Garmin Jr. App
Last Updated: August 22, 2023
Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Policy to provide you with information on how we collect, use, process, and disclose personal data when you and your children use the Garmin Jr. application ("Garmin Jr. app"), formerly known as the vívofit jr. app.
Other Garmin websites, services, apps, and products that include a link to a different Garmin privacy policy are governed by that privacy policy.

.
"Personal data" is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. It includes "personal information" as that term is defined under the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Additional information specific to your jurisdiction may be provided separately, such as additional documents linked to this Privacy Policy or notices provided in the Garmin Jr. app when obtaining parental consent. Please scroll to the "Manage Your Family Data" section to view our supplemental policies that may apply to you. The legal grounds for processing personal data specified in this Privacy Policy are based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and laws in other jurisdictions that have similar grounds. If you are a California resident, please see our
CCPA Privacy Notice

Categories of Personal Data Collected and Processed by Garmin
Personal data that is collected and processed when you, as the parent, create a Garmin account:
When you, as the parent, create a Garmin account, we ask you to provide your email address, name, and password. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish. We may also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) Garmin  collects and processes your email address and password because you use your email address and password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address and password for this purpose is Garmin's legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, Garmin processes your mobile phone number or email address to send the security code via SMS or email. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin's legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account. If you reside in mainland China, Garmin processes your mobile phone number for purposes of real name authentication.
(b) Garmin also collects and processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Garmin products, services, apps, or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Garmin website or app or engage with other Garmin users. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Garmin products, service, apps, or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Garmin users.
(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Garmin, Garmin will also collect and process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Garmin products, services, and apps, as well as newsletters. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your
preferences
in your Garmin account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Garmin are based on the preferences you provide in your Garmin account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Garmin devices you have added to your Garmin account, and any subscriptions included in your Garmin account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Garmin’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails. If you reside in mainland China, Garmin may use your mobile phone number to send you marketing communications via SMS.
(d) Garmin also collects and processes your email address to associate it with your Garmin account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.
(e) Garmin also collects and processes your email address to notify customers when they have violated our terms. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in ensuring a quality experience for all customers and ensuring adherence to our terms.
Additional personal data that is collected and processed when you download the Garmin Jr. app and create your family profile:
When you create your family profile in the Garmin Jr. app, your Garmin Connect name will be used as your admin name in the Garmin Jr. app. You also will be asked to provide a name for your family and a name for each of your children whose compatible devices you add to your profile. You do not need to give your family’s actual name or your children’s full names or even your children’s actual names in the “name” fields. There will be a default wake and bed time for each of your children whose compatible devices you add to your profile. You can, but are not required to, change the default wake and bed times. In addition, you can, but are not required to, type in a location for your family (which can be anything you choose, such as a country, state, city, etc.) and your children’s birthdays and genders. You can leave those fields blank if you wish.
You will be asked to provide a display text for each of your children whose compatible devices you add to your profile. The display text you choose will be shown on your child’s device and may be displayed to others when your child engages in Toe-to-Toe challenges, depending on your settings, as described below in more detail under
"Personal data that may be collected, processed, and disclosed when your child uses the Toe-to-Toe challenge feature."
If you choose to invite another parent or guardian in your family to use the Garmin Jr. app, we will collect the name and email address of that person.
Finally, during setup and use, Garmin collects the device identifier (e.g., model name and unit ID) and device settings from each compatible device you activate.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We collect and process your Garmin Connect name and use it as your Admin name, and we collect and process the name you use for your family name in the Garmin Jr. app so your friends and family members can search for you and add you or your family as Connections. This enables you and your family members to participate in challenges with other families if you wish. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in enabling you and other users to find Connections and engage in challenges.
(b) We collect and process the names you use for your children in your family profile so you can use the Garmin Jr. app’s features, such as reviewing and managing each child’s activities, chores, and rewards. The legal ground for this processing is your consent. You can withdraw your consent by using text other than your child’s name in the name field.
(c) We collect and process the name or other text you input into the display text field so you can choose the name or other text that is shown on your child’s device and when your child participates in a Toe-to-Toe challenge, depending on your settings. The legal ground for processing your child’s name for this purpose, if you choose to use your child’s name in the display text field, is your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time by changing the display text to some text other than your child’s name.
(d) We collect and process your child’s photo so you can personalize your child’s experience in the Garmin Jr. app. The legal ground for processing your child’s photo is your consent. You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your child’s photo at any time by removing the photo from your child’s profile.
(e) We collect and process your child’s birthday so we can improve the Garmin Jr. app and shape future products. The legal ground for processing your child’s birthday is your consent. You can withdraw your consent to process your child’s birthday at any time by removing this information from your child’s profile.
(f) We collect and process your child’s gender so we can improve the Garmin Jr. app and shape future products. The legal ground for processing your child’s gender is your consent. You can withdraw your consent to process your child’s gender at any time by removing this information from your child’s profile.
(g) We collect and process information you give us for a second parent or guardian for the purpose of sending the second parent or guardian an invitation to download the Garmin Jr. app and “join your family.” The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is our legitimate interest in enabling users to add a second parent or guardian to the Garmin Jr. app.
(h) We collect and process information about your child’s device (e.g., model name and unit ID) and device settings so that we can associate the device to your profile where you can review and update the device settings. The legal ground for processing this information is our legitimate interest in enabling users to manage device settings.
Personal data that is collected and processed when you upload data from your child's device to Garmin:
When you sync your child's device with the Garmin Jr. app, you will upload to Garmin information about your child’s device (e.g., model name and unit ID) and device settings and your child’s activity (such as chores, rewards, steps, distance, activity time, and sleep).
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
Garmin collects and processes your child’s activity data to enable you to see and analyze your child's activity data. The legal ground for processing this information is performance of a contract. Information about your child's device and device settings that is uploaded when you sync your child's device with the Garmin Jr. app is collected and processed to help us identify and resolve errors or syncing issues. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Garmin's legitimate interest in providing quality product support.
Personal data that may be collected, processed, and disclosed when your child uses the Toe-to-Toe challenge feature:
The display text you choose to input in the display text field in your Garmin Jr. app, together with the total number of steps taken by your child during the duration of the challenge, will be shown on the devices of your child’s friends or family members if your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe challenge with them, and it will be shown in the Garmin Jr. apps of the parents of such friends and family members and in the Garmin Connect account of friends or family members who use other Garmin devices to engage in a Toe-to-Toe challenge with your child. If you do not want your child’s actual name to be shown on the devices of other users or the Garmin Jr. apps of their parents or Garmin Connect accounts of others when your child participates in a Toe-to-Toe challenge, then you can use any text other than your child’s name that you wish in the display text field.
If you do not wish for the display text to be shown on the devices of other users or the Garmin Jr. apps of their parents or Garmin Connect accounts of others when your child participates in a Toe-to-Toe challenge even if the display text is not your child’s name, then in your Garmin Jr. app, you can change the settings for this to anonymous, in which case the display text shown on the devices of other users or the Garmin Jr. apps of their parents or Garmin Connect accounts of others when your child participates in a Toe-to-Toe challenge will be changed to a generic “JR2” or similar generic and anonymous display text.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
If you provide your child’s name in the display text field, we collect and process it for purposes of displaying it on your child’s device. The legal ground for this processing is your consent, which you can withdraw at any time by changing the display text to something other than your child’s name. If you provide your child’s name in the display text field, we also collect and process it for purposes of displaying it on the devices and apps of others when your child engages in a Toe-to-Toe challenge. The legal ground for this processing is your consent, which you can withdraw at any time by changing the display text to something other than your child’s name or by changing the setting to anonymous.
Personal data that is collected and processed when you use location tracking and communication services:
When you, as the parent, have subscribed to location tracking and communication services (including voice and text messaging or Assistance) for your Family, we collect and process device location and text and voice messages sent through the service. We also process geofences and contact information configured in your Family’s account.
PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
(a) We process device location to allow you to see your child’s location, determine whether the child has entered or exited a configured geofence, and track your child when a request for help has been received. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is performance of a contract.
(b) We process text and voice messages and contact information to facilitate the communications services. We also process your contact information to send you notifications, such as when a request for help has been received. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is performance of a contract.
Personal data that is collected and processed when you communicate with Garmin:
When you interact with our customer support representatives by email or telephone, online, or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences, and information about the Garmin products you own, such as their serial numbers and dates of purchase, and subscriptions you've purchased. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your Garmin account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.
PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUNDS:
We use this information to provide you with customer and product support, to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers, and to facilitate repairs, returns, or exchanges. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is Garmin’s legitimate interest in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your Garmin account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is your consent, which you may withdraw.
Categories of Persons to Whom Personal Data Is Disclosed

Users who are not your Connections will be able to see the family name you choose in your profile, your admin name, the name of any additional parent or guardian you have added to your profile, and the number of children you have added to your profile. Users who are your Connections will be able to see the same information plus the names you have provided for your children in your profile. You can challenge another family to a steps challenge, and you can set up an intrafamily steps challenge for your family. When you engage in a steps challenge with another family, the total steps taken during the duration of the challenge by each participating member of your family, the names of the participating members of your family, and comments submitted through your Garmin Jr. app by participating members of your family will be shown in the Garmin Jr. app of the other family's admin.
