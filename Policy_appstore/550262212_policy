RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Even if you request that we erase your information, we may still need to keep it (see
YOUR RIGHTS
) or may keep it in a form that does not identify you.
The following retention periods will apply, unless we inform you otherwise (or you request that we erase your information).
If you are
Participant

register your interest in or apply to for a CISI Policy but do not purchase the CISI Policy

we may retain
some
of your personal information (including your name, email address and date of birth) for a period of 1 year following the date when you first complete your registration and/or application; or
If you are a
Visitor
and you do not use the CISI Website for 1 year, then we will erase your information.
We may keep certain information for longer periods than those stated above if you have agreed to us using it, for example, for keeping in touch about our services or for our promotional purposes (such as contributing testimonials to the CISI Website).
Please contact our data protection officer if you would like further details on how long we retain your information (see
HOW TO CONTACT CISI
).
KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE
All personal information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We have put in place (and require anyone we share your information with to put in place) appropriate measures to protect the security of your information.
In addition, we limit access to your information to those of our employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. We will require them only to process your information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
You should be aware that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to the CISI Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure.
We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
UPDATING AND ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION
You have the right under data protection laws to access personal information held about you, subject to certain conditions, and to request its rectification or deletion.
If you would like to access or amend the personal information which we hold about you or you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact our data protection officer (see
HOW TO CONTACT
CISI).
To learn more about the rights you may have in relation to your personal information see
YOUR RIGHTS
.
YOUR RIGHTS
By law you have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. We will need to prove your identity before we release any personal information to you.
Request correction or erasure of your personal information (unless we have the legal right to retain it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.
Change your information processing preferences at any time (where this specifically relates to marketing messages, see
MARKETING
).
You should be aware that if you ask us to stop processing your personal information in a certain way or to erase your personal information, and this type of processing is necessary to consider your eligibility for a CISI Policy we may not be able to do so. This does not include your right to object to direct marketing, which can be exercised at any time without restriction.
If you want to exercise any of the rights listed above, please contact our data protection officer (see
HOW TO CONTACT CISI
).
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Right to withdraw consent
Where you have provided your consent to the collection, use or transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact our data protection officer (see
HOW TO CONTACT CISI
). Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.

Participant

Sponsor Contact
