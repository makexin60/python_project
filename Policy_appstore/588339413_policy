Additional Information on our App
Our Apps use certain phone features to enhance user experience. Below we have provided a summary of the device features the apps may use and the reasoning why we use them.
At all times if you no longer wish for the app to use any of the features below, please go to you Apple device settings or Android Permissions Manager to amend access.
Storage -
This permission is needed to be able to move the app to the SD card. The app needs to be able to read and write its own data afterwards. This is an Android feature allows the smartphone owner to free up as much internal / device memory as possible or help them if they change to a new handset.
Network Communication -
This is necessary because the app needs to connect with our servers when queries are run which returns results to the smartphone on real-time and static train information. We are using live data because it is not possible to operate an offline version given the nature of the rail environment. There is also a check whether an internet connection is available.
Your Location -
The app features an option to show stations nearby using Maps and Geo-tagging, so we need to know where the user is for this to work. Raw coordinates are sent to our servers to get a list of stations in the vicinity. The position is only used once and is not stored permanently.
Calendar Access -
This permission allows the app to read and write data to the device's calendar. The user can save trips to his calendar, so we need to be able to store the events. We use the reading permission to get a list of all calendars available as there may be more than one, so the user can choose which calendar the trip will be saved in. We do not read or manipulate any existing calendar entries.
Contact Access -
The app by default looks for permission to contact information for future geo location features we may add such as being able to use a contact address as an origin or destination. Customers are asked to allow or reject the access when they download the newest version of our apps. Users at any time can disable or approve contact information access using the “settings” feature within the app menu or locally on the device via their permission settings.
Mobile App Disclaimer

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For example, https://www.cie.ie is the URL for CIÉ's home page
An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

Cookies on Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail websites
Iarnród Éireann set the following types of cookies on your device when you visit our websites;
Strictly necessary cookies
These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for. These include session cookies that allow users to stay logged in while navigating through the website and carry out essential tasks such as adding items to a shopping basket when purchasing tickets on our website.
These cookies don’t usually contain any personally identifiable information and are typically set by Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail to provide specific services such as e-commerce transactions.
Performance and analytics cookies
These cookies are used to collect statistical information about visitors of the website and the pages they view. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and used anonymously. Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail set Google Analytics cookies to gather this statistical information.

Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail Official Apps
Our Apps use certain phone features to enhance user experience. Below we have provided a summary of the device features the apps may use and the reasoning why we use them.
At all times if you no longer wish for the app to use any of the features below, please go to you Apple device settings or Android Permissions Manager to amend access.
Storage
- This permission is needed to be able to move the app to the SD card. The app needs to be able to read and write its own data afterwards. This is an Android feature that allows the smartphone owner to free up as much internal / device memory as possible or help them if they change to a new handset.
Network Communication -
This is necessary because the app needs to connect with our servers when queries are run for example on real-time and static train information. We are using live data because it is not possible to operate an offline version given the nature of the rail environment. There is also a check whether an internet connection is available.
Your Location
- The app features an option to show stations nearby using Maps and Geo-tagging, so we need to know where the user is located for this to work. Raw coordinates are sent to our servers to get a list of stations in the vicinity. The position is only used once and is not stored permanently.
Your personal information -
This permission allows the app to read and write data to the device's calendar. The user can save trips to his calendar, so we need to be able to store the events. We use the reading permission to get a list of all calendars available as there may be more than one, so the user can choose which calendar the trip will be saved in. We do not read or manipulate any existing calendar entries.
This permission allows the user to place shortcuts on the device's home screen so the they have quick access to certain queries. This saves the user having to re-enter an origin and destination for every journey.

Keeping your information secure
IÉ is committed to protecting the information you provide. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, IÉ has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
When you purchase travel tickets online, pay a fixed penalty notice or access your personal profile you can do so through a secure server. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology means that all personal information, such as your credit/debit card number, will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the Iarnród Éireann booking or payment engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal card transaction by telephone. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.
If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data will be protected. If your browser does not support SSL, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise the transmission of your personal data may not be protected and IÉ disclaims any responsibility in this regard.

Additional Information on our App
Our Apps use certain phone features to enhance user experience. Below we have provided a summary of the device features the apps may use and the reasoning why we use them.
At all times if you no longer wish for the app to use any of the features below, please go to you Apple device settings or Android Permissions Manager to amend access.
Storage -
This permission is needed to be able to move the app to the SD card. The app needs to be able to read and write its own data afterwards. This is an Android feature allows the smartphone owner to free up as much internal / device memory as possible or help them if they change to a new handset.
Network Communication -
This is necessary because the app needs to connect with our servers when queries are run which returns results to the smartphone on real-time and static train information. We are using live data because it is not possible to operate an offline version given the nature of the rail environment. There is also a check whether an internet connection is available.
Your Location -
The app features an option to show stations nearby using Maps and Geo-tagging, so we need to know where the user is for this to work. Raw coordinates are sent to our servers to get a list of stations in the vicinity. The position is only used once and is not stored permanently.
Calendar Access -
This permission allows the app to read and write data to the device's calendar. The user can save trips to his calendar, so we need to be able to store the events. We use the reading permission to get a list of all calendars available as there may be more than one, so the user can choose which calendar the trip will be saved in. We do not read or manipulate any existing calendar entries.
Contact Access -
The app by default looks for permission to contact information for future geo location features we may add such as being able to use a contact address as an origin or destination. Customers are asked to allow or reject the access when they download the newest version of our apps. Users at any time can disable or approve contact information access using the “settings” feature within the app menu or locally on the device via their permission settings.
Mobile App Disclaimer
