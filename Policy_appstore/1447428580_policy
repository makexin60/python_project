User
”). This Privacy Policy explains how Firstup collects, uses, and discloses information about you as a User through its platform, websites, mobile applications and other online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”).

Please visit the privacy policy of the Firstup customer who has granted you access to the services to learn about their data practices with respect to the information they collect using Firstup technology.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time provided that they do not adversely affect your rights unless so mandated by law. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).

Data Retention
We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries
Firstup is based in the United States and we process and store information in the U.S. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it e.g. by signing the standard contractual clauses stipulated by the EU Commission with the data recipients or by relying on other approved methods. If Firstup transfers personal data to official authorities outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom (“UK”), or Switzerland, if required by law, express consent has been given or is based on the legitimate interest of Social Chorus or the party for data protection purposes, e.g. internal administrative purposes and no higher legitimate interest of the data subject.
Residents of the EEA, UK, and Switzerland
If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.

· In order to perform our responsibilities under a contract with our customers, such as by providing the Firstup services you requested.
Data Subject Requests
If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you should contact the organization who has granted you access to our services. You may also contact us using the contact information below to exercise these rights, but be advised that we generally do not retain the personal data we collect to identify the customer experiences you are eligible to access, and thus will likely not be able to honor your request.
Questions or Complaints
If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see:
