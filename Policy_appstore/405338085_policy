CCPA Privacy Policy
Last updated & Effective Date:
April 9, 2020
This Privacy Policy explains how Appodeal Inc. receives and processes user’s personal information (“Users PI”). Appodeal receives Users PI that has been provided to it by publishers (“Supply Partners”), and shares the Users PI to advertisers and related parties (“Demand Partners”) in order to provide various services including personalized advertising and related adtech services (“Services”).
What Information & Why
Appodeal has no direct engagement with Supply Partner Users. Appodeal requires its Supply Partners and Demand Partners to provide a privacy notice as required under applicable laws. Supply Partners are responsible for ensuring that Users PI has been collected in accordance with applicable law.
Appodeal’s Supply Partners download a Software Development Kit (“SDK”) on their mobile site(s). The SDK facilitates the transfer of User PI to Appodeal so that Appodeal can provide ad monetization Services to the Supply Partner including the placement and serving of personalized ads to the mobile site(s) for viewing by the User.
Appodeal only receives User PI that Supply Partners have instructed us, with their Users permission, for the business purposes of providing the Services. For example, if a User uses a mobile application where the Supply Partner has embedded Appodeal’s SDK, then the SDK will provide to Appodeal only the User PI that Supply Partner has enabled Appodeal to receive in order to provide the Services.
Appodeal may receive the following User PI:
Information about User’s mobile advertising identifiers, such as User’s Advertising ID (Apple IDFA or Google AAID).
Information that User’s device provides, such as device IP address, network connection type and device GPS location.
Information about User’s age and gender.
Appodeal processes this User PI solely for the business purposes of providing the Services, which include:
Providing personalized ads to Users;
Providing support to Supply Partners;
Analyzing the performance of the Services;
Improving the Services; and
Protecting the Services from fraud, misuse and illegal activity.
With Whom?
At the instruction of its Supply Partners, Appodeal shares the Users PI with its Demand Partners for the purpose of providing Services including serving personalized ads to Users.
In addition to its Demand Partners, Appodeal shares Users PI with other trusted Service Providers who provide services for the business purposes of hosting services, payment processing, IT services, security services, customer services, and marketing services.
Aggregated Information
Appodeal may use aggregated information (not containing personal information) to analyze trends and improve our Services.
Compliance with Laws
Appodeal may disclose Users PI to a third party if (a) it believes that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or (b) to protect the security or integrity of the Services from harm or illegal activities.
Business Transfers
Appodeal may share or transfer Users PI in connection with, any merger, sale of Appodeal assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of the business to another company.
California Users
Appodeal acts as a Service Provider under the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”). Appodeal follows the Supply Partner(s)’ instructions in processing the Users PI for the business purposes of providing the Services. Appodeal follows the Supply Partner(s)’ instructions to delete any Users PI requested. Appodeal does not sell its Users PI as defined under CCPA. Appodeal upholds Users right of non- discrimination as defined under CCPA.
Nevada Users
Appodeal does not sell Users PI as defined by Section 1.6 of Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
Retention Policy
Appodeal retains Users PI as long as necessary to provide the Services unless a longer period is required to be permitted for legal or compliance purposes. Do Not Track: Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. Appodeal does not respond to DNT signals.
Security
Appodeal employs industry standard technological measures that are reasonably designed to help protect information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. While Appodeal takes reasonable efforts to guard information, no security system is impenetrable.
Policy On Information Collected From Children
This Site and our Services are not directed at children under the age of 13. Appodeal does not knowingly collect Users PI from children under the age of 13.
Changes
Appodeal may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our Services and the laws applicable to our provision of the Services to you. If Appodeal does change this Privacy Policy, it will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy on the Site. Continued use of this Site or the Services after the posting of such notice will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
