Playlabs, LLC (“Playlabs”, “Playlabs games” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users (“users” or “you”). This Online Privacy Policy has been created to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with Playlabs. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited only to information collected by our games through use of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control.
By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information and non-personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
It is advised that you review this Policy regularly as it may be amended from time to time, without notice.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED
Our primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.
When you install our games, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through the social networking website in accordance with their policies and terms.
The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. Personal information may include:
Your name;
Device identification number;
Your location;
IP address;
Email address;
Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as your IP address, but that may be considered part of an individual’s personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.
Additionally, we may acquire information from you through:
Your access and participation in message boards on the Service;
Your email of a question to our customer support;
Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.
The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through our games, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email address and content.
We will never at any time ask you for your credit card or bank account information, your login or password, or national identification numbers via any unsolicited means, including email and telephone calls.
SENSITIVE INFORMATION
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Properties or otherwise to us.
SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, We do not share your personal information with any third parties. In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. We also may share your information with third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.
We may share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for us, these companies may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the purpose of our requested service.
In conjunction with the running of our games we may partner with a third party to assist us in providing you with our Service. We will share the information you provide us through your social network such as (1) your first and last name, (2) your profile picture or its URL, (3) your user identification number of the pertinent social network, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile picture (4) the login email you provide to the pertinent social network upon registration; (5) game play information with these third parties so they may facilitate the use of our Service as well as contact you about other games which may be of interest to you, service notifications and to solicit your feedback and input. If you do not wish to have this information shared please do not use our Service. If you wish to no longer have your personal information used by our partners you may contact us to
support@playlabs.net
and we will facilitate your request to the partner.
We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain technical information and other non-personal information to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect technical information and other non-personal information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).
Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy.  Make sure to read
Appodeal’s Privacy Policy.

We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Appodeal related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Website to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.

(e) Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
We hope that you find the display of interest-based Ads valuable. However, if you wish to opt-out of these advertising services, you can edit your preferences by visiting the “Settings” page of the Website and selecting the option to opt-out.
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your Devices or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile Devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their Device settings or by downloading the AppChoices mobile application offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at
networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out found at
www.appodeal.com/home/sdk-opt-out
and/or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each Device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile Device. You must separately opt-out on each Device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
