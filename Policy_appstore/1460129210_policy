We do not offer financial incentives and price or service differences, and we do not discriminate against consumers, employees, applicants, or independent contractors for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
Submission Process
. You may submit a request to exercise one of the above rights via email to
privacy@manychat.com
. If a request is submitted in an incorrect manner or if it is deficient, we will either (1) treat the request as if it had been submitted via the designated manner, or (2) provide you with specific directions on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies, as applicable.
Verification Process
. We are required to verify the identities of those who submit requests exercise the above rights. To determine whether the individual making the request is the consumer about whom we have collected information, we will verify your identity by matching the identifying information provided by you in the request to the personal information that we already maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will be required to provide your name, address, and telephone number. We will inform you if we cannot verify your identity.
If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request for categories of personal information, we may deny the request. If the request is denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will provide a copy of, or direct you to, our privacy policy.
If we cannot verify the identity of the person making the request for specific pieces of personal information, we are prohibited from disclosing any specific pieces of personal information to the requestor. However, if denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will evaluate the request as if it is seeking the disclosure of categories of personal information about the consumer.
If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request to delete, we may deny the request.
If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor to the degree of certainty required, we will state this in our response and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor.
Authorized Agents
. Authorized agents may submit requests via the methods identified in this Notice. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete, we may require: (1) the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request; (2) you to verify your identity directly with us; and (3) you to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. However, we will not require these actions if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code.
Excessive Requests
. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
