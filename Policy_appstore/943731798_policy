Name, email address, phone, address, and date of birth.
Description of your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use personal information you provide in a verifiable consumer request only to verify the requester’s identity or authority to make the request and to maintain a record of your request.
You may make a consumer request for a right to know or data deletion twice within a 12-month period. RateFast will respond to your request in accordance with the CCPA. If we deny your request, we will explain why.

RateFast does not sell, and in the preceding 12 months did not sell, California residents’ personal information.

You may have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Depending on your request, this may include:
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of personal information we collected about you.

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. For California residents, the CCPA also provides a right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. At this time, we do not sell your personal information, except to the extent that the sharing of cookie information for purposes of targeted advertising constitutes a “sale” under the CCPA. To exercise your options with respect to cookies, please select “Cookie Preferences” on the banner that is visible at the bottom of our website, or click link on the bottom of athenahealth.com labeled, “Cookie Preferences”.
Exercising Your Right to Know, Correct, Limit, and Request Deletion of Your Data
If you are a California resident, under the CCPA you may request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use or disclose about you (“right to know”) and to request deletion of personal information.
Under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), you have the right to correct inaccurate personal information that we may have about you and you have the right to limit the use and disclosure of your SPI (sensitive personal information).
To exercise any of your rights regarding your data, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

Only you or a person legally authorized to act for you may make requests related to your personal information. The request must include documentation that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:
Name, email address, phone, address, and date of birth.
Description of your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond.
We cannot substantively respond to your request or send personal information to you if we cannot verify your identity or your authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you, except in cases where the CCPA, CPRA, or other state specific laws, do not require a verifiable request for a response. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use personal information you provide in a verifiable consumer request only to verify the requester’s identity or authority to make the request and to maintain a record of your request.
You may make a consumer request for a right to know or data deletion twice within a 12-month period. RateFast will respond to your request in accordance with the CCPA. If we deny your request, we will explain why.
You may not be discriminated against because you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA in violation of California Civil Code § 1798.125.
When a business sells your personal information, you have a right to opt out of such sale. RateFast does not sell, and in the preceding 12 months did not sell, California residents’ personal information. RateFast does not have actual knowledge that it sells the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
