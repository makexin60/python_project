The term “
Planner 5D
”, “
we
”, “
our
”, “
us
” refers to UAB Planner5D, a legal entity incorporated and acting under the laws of Lithuania with its registered address at Antakalnio St. 17, Vilnius, Lithuania, 10312, including its subsidiaries and affiliates.
The term “
you
”, “
your
”, “
yours
” defines a visitor of one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services as defined below, or a customer of a user.
The term “
Personal Data
” means information that either in isolation or in combination with other information enables you to be directly or indirectly identified.
We place great importance on the privacy and security of your Personal Data and are committed to ensure appropriate protection of any Personal Data we obtain from you or about you.
This privacy policy (“
Privacy Policy
”) explains how we collect, use, share and protect your Personal Data obtained by us in course of your interaction with our websites
www.planner5d.com
,
www.planner5d.pro
and your use of our services offered either via our websites or mobile applications (collectively, “
Services
”). It also outlines the rights you have and control you can exercise in relation to it.
Please carefully read this Privacy Policy and make sure you fully understand it and agree to it before interacting with our websites and using our Services.
This Privacy Policy is a legal part of the
Terms of Service
of Planner 5D. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.
DATA CONTROLLER/DATA PROCESSOR
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“
GDPR
”) framework, the terms "data controller" and "data processor" have specific meanings:
Data Controller
is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data. The data controller decides "why" and "how" personal data should be processed.
Data Processor
is the entity that processes Personal Data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor follows the instructions of the data controller regarding the processing of the data.
In cases when Planner 5D provides Services to our end users and determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, Planner 5D acts as a “data controller”. In this role we manage the processing of Personal Data, while our
third-party service providers
act as the “data processors”, processing the Personal Data on behalf of Planner 5D. We may engage various third-party service providers in order to process your data more effectively.
In cases when Planner 5D Services are used for business and/or educational purposes – such as by professional designers, legal entities, schools and other institutions, that provide services to their own customers, and these entities determine the purposes and means of data processing, Planner 5D acts as “data processor”, processing the data according to the instructions provided by these entities. In such cases, the data processing is governed by the
Data Processing Addendum
, unless a different data processing agreement has been signed between the data controller and Planner 5D.
