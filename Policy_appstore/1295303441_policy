. This Privacy Policy describes how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by us when you sign up for and use the Mint Mobile service and it provides other important privacy information, describes when and how we may change this Privacy Policy, and tells you how to contact us with any questions or comments.
Purpose of Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to Mint Mobile. Accordingly, Mint Mobile provides these policies so that you understand how Mint Mobile collects, uses and, in certain circumstances, discloses the information that you provide and/or that is automatically provided to Mint Mobile as a result of your visiting and using the Site or purchasing or using Mint Mobile products or services. This Privacy Policy also explains the steps Mint Mobile has taken to secure your personal information. Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. By visiting this Site or purchasing or using any Mint Mobile product or service, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Mint Mobile is not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any third-party website that may be linked to or from this Site. Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to our customer service department at (800) 683-7329.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal information is information that identifies or is associated with a specific individual, such as a name, address, email address, or telephone number. Mint Mobile collects personal information about its customers. The ways in which we collect personal information about you include, but are not limited to, the following:
Registration and Ordering.
Before using certain parts of this Site or purchasing Mint Mobile products or services, you must complete an online registration form or provide certain information to Mint Mobile’s representatives. During registration (whether via this Site or otherwise), you will be prompted to provide to Mint Mobile certain personal information, which may include, but is not limited to, your name, billing address(es), phone number, port-in phone number, email address, and credit card number. This personal information is used for billing purposes, fulfilling your orders, and communicating with you about your order and this Site, and for marketing purposes. If Mint Mobile encounters a problem when processing your order, it will use your personal information to contact you.
User Submissions.
Certain areas of this Site may permit you to enter your email address and other contact information to receive further information about Mint Mobile or for other purposes. Your submissions for these purposes are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to Mint Mobile. Should you choose to submit information in response to these requests, Mint Mobile may collect and publish your name, email address, geographic location and other information collected by Mint Mobile to market Mint Mobile products and services and any other products and services offered by Mint Mobile.
Automatically Generated and Collected Information.
In addition to information that you volunteer as described above, this Site utilizes technologies to collect information and track your user experience. Mint Mobile will use this information to improve this Site and user experience. In addition, this Site automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access this Site and may also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address (which may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet), Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. In addition, all wireless communication systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically located.
Information Collected by and/or Provided to Third Parties.
We may obtain information about you and combine it with your account information. For example, we may receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased a Mint Mobile product prior to your commencing service with us. In addition, we use a third-party service provider to serve ads and/or collect data on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this Web site. Some of these service providers may collect information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services to tailor marketing messages on this Web site and other sites or to trigger real time interaction, customize this Web site or enhance your profile.  Some of these service providers may be able to collect personal information that you share with this site via a web form automatically and prior to your pressing a submit button; and they may be able to use information from your visits to this site to send marketing messages to you in a way that may personally identify you. This information is collected through the use of a cookie, a javascript tag and/or pixel, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.  The information collected by these service providers may include your device’s IP address, user agent, email addresses (where hashed or otherwise rendered pseudonymous) and other user and device level pseudonymous information. Please keep in mind that your browser settings may not permit you to control the technologies utilized by these third-party companies.

Location-Based Services.
We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm. Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available by us and other entities, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources. These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.).LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our supplier’s network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where our network supplier allows third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our supplier’s network, our network supplier requires those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity. You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people. Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared.
Generally, Mint Mobile collects the above information for the following purposes: (i) to improve your experience on this Site; (ii) to improve the products and services that Mint Mobile sells to consumers; (iii) to communicate with you regarding this Site; (iv) to market and sell products and services to you and send you information about special offers; (v) to contact you about products or services you have purchased from Mint Mobile (including but not limited to the Mint Mobile service); (vi) to respond to your inquiries; (vii) to manage and develop our business and operations, administer accounts, and collect and process payments; and (viii) if you authorize text messaging, we will use your mobile number to communicate with you about your account and to send marketing text messages to you. If you decide that you no longer wish to receive emails or text messages from Mint Mobile that you had authorized, you may opt-out of receiving emails and text messages by managing your account preferences on this Site or by any other reasonable opt-out method available to you. Please note that Mint Mobile may have to communicate with you about product or service orders that you choose to place. You cannot opt-out of receiving product or service-related emails. Mint Mobile will not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to third parties, except as noted below. Mint Mobile may sell, rent, trade, license, use and disclose all non-personal information and aggregate information, so long as such information does not personally identify you or any user, to any third party for any purpose, including, but not limited to, research and analytical purposes. Under federal law, you have a right, and Mint Mobile has a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information regarding your telephone use, the services you purchase from us, the calls you place and the location of your device on our network when you make a telephone call. This information is referred to as, among other things, “Customer Proprietary Network Information.” We may share Customer Proprietary Network Information with our affiliates; provided, however, that we will first notify you of your rights under applicable law, describe how we intend to use the Customer Proprietary Network Information, and give you an opportunity to opt-out of such use (or opt-in, to the extent required by applicable law).
Mint Mobile may disclose your personal information to third parties, including in the following circumstances:
Mint Mobile uses third party service providers to perform specific functions on its behalf, and it must disclose personal information to help those parties perform their services (for example, Mint Mobile would disclose your name, address and phone number to a commercial carrier such as Federal Express or UPS in order to deliver a physical product that you order, and it would disclose your name and credit card number and other information to financial services and credit card processing companies in order to process your orders).
Mint Mobile may be required to disclose personal information in response to a legal process, order or investigation (for example, a subpoena or court order).
Mint Mobile may disclose personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect its legal rights or to protect itself or others (for example, in order to reduce the risk of fraud or illegal activities).
Mint Mobile may share personal information among its affiliated companies (for example, for the purpose of marketing products and services to you).
Mint Mobile may provide identity verification services to third parties, and your personal information may be included in the data transferred to third parties in connection with those services.
Mint Mobile may acquire, merge with or be acquired by another company, or it might sell some or all of its assets, and, in such a case, your personal information may be included in the transferred business assets. Also, in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, your personal information may be included in the transferred assets.
3. Cookies and Similar Online Tracking Technologies
“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communications and interaction with that website. Cookies may possibly be used for such things as: (1) to customize your visitation and shopping experience; (2) to deliver content consistent with your stated interests; (3) to provide you with custom-tailored content; or (4) to save your password in password-protected areas. The use of cookies is an industry-standard — you will find them at most major websites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of this Site will not function properly if you do so. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to furnish this Site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand usage of this Site and to improve the content and offerings on this Site. In addition, we may utilize web beacons to recognize you when you visit this Site. We may also use other technologies to provide us with other important anonymous information regarding the use of this Site. To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a “sale” or “sharing” (which includes targeted advertising) under California law, California residents can opt-out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request via the “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” link at the bottom of most of our website pages.
4. Security
We take precautions and have implemented certain technical measures intended to protect against unauthorized access to, disclosure of, and unlawful interception of personal information submitted via this Site, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all financial transactions through this Site. However, your communications containing personal information may be unlawfully intercepted or accessed by third parties and/or this Site may be subject to network attacks or malfunctions. We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet. Once we receive your personal information, we take steps that we believe are reasonable to limit access to your personal information to only those employees and service providers whom we determine need access to the personal information to provide the requested products, services, offers or opportunities that may be of interest to you or that you have ordered, or that we otherwise disclose in accordance with Section 2 above. However, even after we receive your personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of our security efforts or as a result of any other event beyond our reasonable control. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information or any other information is completely secure and safe from any risk.
5. Protection of Children & Children’s Privacy Notice

Moreover, Mint Mobile does not knowingly solicit Children to purchase any of its products or services, including without limitation mobile wireless service plans.
For additional information related to our data practices for users under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in their state of residence), please see our

.
6. Advertisements and Links

Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure:
This Site does not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals of web browsers in general, as there currently are no uniform technological standards for recognizing and implementing “Do Not Track” signals. However, this Site does respond to signals sent from California residents using a service called the
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
, which may be considered a “Do Not Track” signal. For more information, see Section 9 below.

9. California Residents
California has a data protection law called the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended, and this Section 9 includes information Mint Mobile is required to disclose under that law. This section applies to you only if you are a California resident.
Selling and Sharing Personal Information
The CCPA gives California residents certain rights, including the right to tell companies to not “sell” or “share” their personal information. ​In this Section 9, we use the terms “sell” and “share” as they are defined in the CCPA. The CCPA defines “sell” or “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information (including information that does not directly identify an individual) in exchange for anything of value, which isn’t limited to the exchange of money. “Share” is defined narrowly as providing personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. We engage in certain activities (as described below) that may be considered selling or sharing personal information under the CCPA. That’s why we include a “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” link at the bottom of most of our website pages and in some of our apps. If you are a California resident, you can click this link to tell us to not sell or share your personal information. Note that according to the CCPA, certain exchanges of personal information aren’t considered selling or sharing. For example, if you specifically direct us to share your personal information, then we’ll do so. It is also not selling or sharing if we place ads based solely on information we collect when you visit our websites. Other examples include disclosures of personal information to service providers or other third parties as described in Section 2 above.
Global Privacy Control
Mint Mobile participates in a service called the
Global Privacy Control (GPC)
that lets you set a “Do Not Sell or Share” preference at the browser level. You’ll need to have a GPC-enabled browser or browser extension that you’ll activate or turn on in the browser. When you visit a website, your browser will automatically send the site a “Do Not Sell or Share” signal and participating websites, like ours, will honor your preference. Note: Not all browsers and extensions offer a GPC setting. To download a GPC-enabled browser, go to the
Global Privacy Control website
. To check if our website received your GPC signal, click on the “
Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
” link in our footer. If we’re receiving your GPC signal, we’ll automatically opt you out of the sale of your personal information and tell you that a GPC signal was used. When we’re detecting your active GPC signal, we won’t allow you to opt back into the sale or sharing of your personal information.
Personal Information We Collect, Disclose for a Business Purpose, and Sell or Share
The chart below summarizes the categories of personal information we may have collected from you in the past 12 months, and how we collect, use, disclose, sell, or share your personal information.

(see above
Children’s Privacy Notice).
We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the business purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

Mint Mobile Cookie Policy
California residents have the right to opt out of the "sale" or “share” of their personal information. Under California law, “sale” is defined broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value, which isn’t limited to the exchange of money. “Share” is targeted advertising, defined narrowly as providing personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. For more details on sale and share, see “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information explained” in the Mint Mobile Privacy Policy.

The
GPC
signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per
CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315
for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the
GPC
signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers (
GDPR Articles 7 & 21
). Over time, the
GPC
signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
“
CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.
”
Xavier Becerra
CA Attorney General
“
40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve [the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.
”
Mark R. Warner
VA Senator
“
GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.
”
Alexander McD White
Bermuda Privacy Commissioner
“
It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project [Global Privacy Control] shows it’s possible.
”
Ron Wyden
Senate Finance Chairman
“
CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.

Frequently Asked Questions
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow
Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.
The GPC was initially spearheaded by
Ashkan
Soltani
Georgetown
Law
and
Sebastian
Zimmeck
(
Wesleyan
University
) in collaboration with
The New York
Times
,
The Washington
Post
,
Financial Times
,
Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)
,
Glitch
,
DuckDuckGo
,
Brave
,
Mozilla
,
Disconnect
,
Abine
,
Digital Content Next (DCN)
,
Consumer
Reports
, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed
here
. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
here
.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available
here
.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(
@globablprivctrl
).
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org
.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Privacy
Community Group
(Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal
here
.
Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).
