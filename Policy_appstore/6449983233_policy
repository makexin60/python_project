What Could You Do With a Mighty Network?
Let's Find Out!
Mighty Networks Privacy Policy
Last updated: April 01, 2024
Mighty Networks is a service provider of community software as a service.
Welcome to Mighty Networks!
Mighty Networks is a Service of Mighty Software. Inc. All visitors to our Service (‚ÄúVisitors‚Äù) who register with the Service and join a Mighty Network are either Members or Hosts. Hosts are the organizers of Mighty Networks. Members register and participate in Mighty Networks. Hosts decide who can join their Mighty Network and whether they choose paid Member subscriptions on their Mighty Network. People who merely visit our website at
www.mightynetworks.com
(‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù) or visit a Network without registering are Visitors (but not Hosts or Members). This Privacy Policy describes how we, Mighty Software, Inc., obtain and use information about you and your visits to our Website and your participation in a Mighty Network and your use of Mighty Networks mobile applications. To offer the personalized experience of a Mighty Network, we collect personal information about you (‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù). This policy describes how we collect, use, and share your Personal Data with your Host and other Members and third parties in connection with your use of the Service and the Website, including our mobile applications. Unless defined here, capitalized words have the same meaning as in the
Mighty Networks Terms of Use
, which this Privacy Policy is part of.
For residents of California, the EU, EEA or the UK,  the
California Privacy Notice
and
EU/ EEA/ UK Privacy Notice
supplement and form part of this Privacy Policy. Residents of Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia should review the California Privacy Notice for more information about your rights and our compliance with California and other state privacy laws.
1. Information we collect and how we use it
When you visit our Website, join or create a Network, interact with us or your Host through the Service, or use our mobile applications, we, as the service provider for your Host, collect Personal Data and other information from you (collectively, ‚ÄúData‚Äù). We use your Personal Data to be able to provide the Service to you:
We collect Personal Data when you share it voluntarily.
We collect some Personal Data automatically when you visit our website, use the Service or use our Mighty Networks mobile applications.
We and your Hosts use your Personal Data to provide and improve the Service, understand how you and other Members are using Mighty Networks and to inform you about products and services that may be of interest to you.
Data does not include Your Content or User Generated Content. As we explain in our Terms of Use, you (and the people you license Your Content from) keep complete ownership of all Your Content. By posting Your Content on the Service, you grant us a license to use it, but you and your licensors still own it.
A. Personal Data you provide directly
‚ÄòPersonal Data or Personal Information‚Äô
means any information relating to you from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, including your name, identification number, location, online identifier such as your IP address or device ID, or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
‚ÄòSpecial Categories of Personal Data‚Äô
means data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation.
‚ÄòAggregated Data‚Äô
is data in a summary form for statistical analysis. A common purpose of aggregation is to get more information about particular groups based on specific variables such as age, profession, or income level.
‚ÄòPseudonymisation‚Äô
means the processing of your personal data in a way that the personal data can no longer identify you without the use of additional information, so long as the additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to prevent you from being identified or identifiable. We store and use your Personal Data together with an ID we assign each time you join a new Mighty Network. We assign you one ID per Mighty Network to ensure you have a personalized experience in each one.
Name and Email Address.
When you register as a Host or Member of a Mighty Network, we ask you for your real name and your email address. Both we and the Host of the Mighty Network receive access to this information and use it to communicate with you about the Service. In addition, we and your Host may use this address to email you about products or services believed to be of interest to you. If you are a paying Host or Member, we may also collect your mailing address and zip code for billing purposes. Hosts may decide to collect your mailing address, via our Service.
Social Media Profiles.
You can also register with your Facebook or LinkedIn account. When you register this way, you give us permission to access your Facebook or LinkedIn profile and photo. Your profile and photo will become part of your Mighty Network profile. See below for more information on Integrated Services like Facebook and LinkedIn.
Profiles and Topics.
When you join a Mighty Network, you will be prompted to add a profile, including a short bio, and to choose topics to follow (‚ÄúTopics‚Äù). From this information, Mighty Networks personalizes your experience in each Mighty Network. Your Host can also choose and customize categories of Personal Data to collect from you including, if you agree, Special Categories of Personal Data.
Your Location.
We ask you for your location so that we can facilitate interactions with other Members in your geographic area. In addition, if you opt-in our mobile app collects your GPS location information. If you enable location features, or do not disable GPS on your mobile device, other Members may be able to see your location.
Other Personal Data You Provide Directly.
You may also provide us Personal Data when you use certain features of the Service such as participating in conversations or polls in your Networks, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our surveys. When you agree to participate in a recorded livestream or other Mighty Network event, you share your voiced comments and images of your face on camera.
B. Personal Data and Information we collect automatically
You have the option of registering using an Integrated Service, such as Facebook. If you choose to do this, your profile picture and other Personal Data in your profile on the Integrated Service will become part of your profile on Mighty Networks. Please see the section below on Integrated Services for more detail.
Information About Your Use of the Service and Website.
Our servers automatically record your visits to the Service and the Website. Like all other website and mobile app servers, ours compiles a log that records the date, time, browser (i.e., Firefox), device type (i.e., iPhone), operating system (i.e. Android), and originating IP address of each page you visit.
We use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your visits to our Website and Service. Cookies are text files placed on your computer by websites to collect standard log information and visitor behavior information. Our cookies collect the following information about you: which website or ad you visited right before ours, which pages you visited on our Service, and how much time you spent on each section of our Service. We may also collect other data about your visit, such as search requests and results. We use this information for our legitimate interests to track usage of our Service, to measure the number of unique visitors to the different sections of our Service, to understand how Members find and join Mighty Networks (ad effectiveness), and to help us make our Service more valuable to every Host and Member. The use of this information is called ‚Äúanalytics.‚Äù Often information used for analytics is aggregated.
Instead of cookies, sometimes we or our service providers, such as Google, use hashed data, such as email addresses, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.
Our mobile applications on iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) have to interact with our computer servers. We assign your device a token so that you do not have to log in every time you use the Service via our mobile apps.
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our Service features may not work properly without cookies. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. For more information about cookies visit
https://www.allaboutcookies.org
.
Information About Your Location.
From your IP address, we can tell generally where you are when you are accessing our Service, such as which city. We start by choosing a location for you based on the IP address of your Internet connection. You can update or remove this location at any time by logging in to your account on the Service.
C. Personal Data and Information Third Parties collect automatically
Third-Party Cookies for Site Use Analysis.
We use third parties such as Google to help us analyze how people are using our Service. We also use the Google Analytics service to provide us with demographic data about our Visitors, Hosts and Members, such as age and gender. Google uses a cookie that can be recognized by Google or its affiliate DoubleClick when you visit other websites. For more information about how Google collects, uses, and shares your information, please visit the Google Privacy Policy-Partners website at
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
.
Third-Party Cookies Used to Target Host Ads on Other Websites.
‚ÄúBeacons‚Äù are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage across websites and over time. Our Hosts may use their own or third party cookies or beacons to target Host ads to you when you visit other websites. Our Hosts may also work with other companies who use their cookies or beacons to target third party ads to you on other websites based on your prior visits to the Host‚Äôs Network on our website Service. This is called online behavioral advertising (‚ÄúOBA‚Äù), because you receive ads based on your prior online behavior. We do not have access to these cookies; it is third parties who engage in OBA.
Third-Party Cookies Used to Target Mighty Networks Ads on Other Websites.
We work with third parties to serve ads about the Service through websites, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at people who are Site Visitors or Mighty Network Members.
2. Our Sharing of your Personal Data and other information
We consider personalizing your Mighty Networks experience an important part of our Service. We want you to understand what Personal Data gets shared with your Hosts, other Members of your Mighty Networks, other Hosts or Members of our Service, and other third parties as part of the Service.
‚ÄòThird Party‚Äô
means a person or company who is not a Host or another Network Member, and government bodies and public agencies and authorities. Third Parties include our service providers whom we authorize, through a data processing agreement, to process your personal data or information to help us with: development, maintenance, and support of our websites and mobile applications, marketing and advertising, marketing research and analysis, communications, and customer service. We do not permit our Third Party service providers to use your personal data for any other purpose. We do not share Personal Data with any person or company unless we have an agreement with them that controls their use of the data.
‚ÄòProcessing‚Äô or ‚ÄòProcess‚Äô
means any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, including by automatic methods, such as collecting, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, adapting or altering, retrieving, consulting, using, disclosing, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available, aligning or combining, restricting, erasing or destroying.
‚ÄòConsent‚Äô or ‚ÄòAgree‚Äô
means your freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous expression of your wishes through a statement or other clear affirmative action such as checking a box which indicates your agreement to our processing of personal data relating to you.
If you are not comfortable with this type of sharing, don‚Äôt use our Service.
A. Personal Data shared within the Service
Your Host.
Your Host, or Hosts if are there more than one, will have access to your name, email address, and all personal or contact information that you provide when you register for that Host‚Äôs Mighty Network. In order to facilitate Member engagement, our Host will also have access to Data regarding your usage activity, in both aggregated and personally identifiable forms. For example, Hosts will be able to see aggregated Member activity within a Mighty Network, as well as specific information like how many people cheered in response to a comment you made. Your Host also will be able to associate Your Content, and any Personal Information it contains, with your contact information. Your Hosts may communicate with you outside of the Service about the Mighty Network or relevant topics of interest to you, and may retain your personal information after you leave the Mighty Network, unless you request otherwise. Hosts have committed in the Mighty Networks Terms of Use (/terms-of-use) to comply with applicable laws and regulations about their handling of Data and not to sell your information to third-parties. You should only join a Mighty Network if you are comfortable sharing your personal information with the Host of that Mighty Network.  If your Host has an additional privacy policy covering the Host‚Äôs use of Personal Data, you should review it carefully to understand how your Host may use Personal Data.
Searching and Messaging by Others.
Visitors to our Service may be able to search for you by your name and location if you are a Member of a Mighty Network. Members of your Mighty Network can search for you by location, Topics, or other personal information so that they may message you within the Mighty Network. Whether your information is available to other Visitors and Members depends on whether the Mighty Network is Paid, Public, Private, or Secret.
Public, Private, Secret, and Paid Mighty Networks.
A Host can select whether to make a Mighty Network Public, Private, Secret, or Paid.
In
Public
Mighty Networks, all Visitors (including Hosts and Members) can see your name and photo (‚ÄúProfile‚Äù), as well as Your Content and activity. Unless your Host specifies otherwise, in a Public Mighty Network, search engines like Google index all public activity, including Profiles.
In
Private
Mighty Networks, any Visitor can find the Mighty Network, but cannot enter without an invitation or membership request approval. Only Hosts and other Members can see Profiles, Your Content, and activity.
In
Secret
Mighty Networks, only Members directly invited can find a Secret Mighty Network. It is not available to search engines. Only Hosts and other Members can see Profiles, Your Content, and activity.
In
Paid
Mighty Networks, any Visitor can find the Mighty Network, but cannot enter without paying the fee. Only Hosts and other Members can see Profiles, Your Content, and activity.
Personal Information Included in Your Content.
If you include personal information in Your Content, it will be displayed to other Members based on the privacy levels defined above.
B. Personal Data and Information shared with Third Parties

Mighty Software, Inc., like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include emailing information to you, maintaining our Website, databases and mobile applications, processing payments, marketing and advertising, marketing research and analysis, and customer service. When we employ another company to perform a function of this type, we only provide them with the Personal Data and Information they need to perform their specific function and we do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose your personal information except as necessary to perform the tasks we have asked them to do for us or to comply with legal requirements.

Please see our
Cookie Policy
for important information about non-Google cookies that are placed by us or by our business partners on your computer, mobile phone or other device and how to opt out. We do not have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks, or any other non-affiliated third parties. If you would like to learn more about OBA or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit
https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
, or if you are located in the UK, European Union/European Economic Area, please visit European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Your Online Choices website at
http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/
. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
H. Deleting cookies
To manage or delete browser cookies, please see your browser‚Äôs privacy settings.
I. Global Privacy Control
Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control (‚ÄúGPC‚Äù) that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data "sales" as defined under certain laws. In certain territories, when we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a GPC setting as required by applicable law.
J. Do Not Track
Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Unlike the GPC described above, there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, our Website and Service do not respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.
K. Mobile Advertising ID Controls
iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.
5. Account termination
You can leave one or more of your Mighty Networks, or delete your Mighty Network account (on a Network by Network basis). As soon as you leave, we stop collecting your Personal Data for that Mighty Network. See this article for more information:
https://faq.mightynetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204991129
.
6. Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Mighty Software, Inc. outside the Service, such as a telephone call. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Mighty Software, Inc. through the Service or through any other means, such as information posted to any public areas of the Service, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, ‚ÄúUnsolicited Information‚Äù). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Mighty Software, Inc. shall be free to reproduce and use such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution. We respect your copyrights in Your Content, as outlined in our Terms of Use.
7. Disputes with Hosts or other Members
Mighty Networks cannot control the actions of Hosts or other Members; if you have a privacy-related dispute with a Host or another Member, you should contact that person directly. You should alert us
help@mightynetworks.com
if you believe that a Host or another Member has violated this Privacy Policy or our
Acceptable Use Policy
.
8. Children
Mighty Networks does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the Service or submit any Personal Data through the Service. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Mighty Networks through the Service, please contact us at
help@mightynetworks.com
and we will look to delete that information from our databases.
9. Links to other web applications
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Mighty Software, Inc. (the ‚ÄúThird Party Sites‚Äù). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Service do not imply that Mighty Software, Inc. endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information about their privacy policies and practices. For example, please be aware that when you click through to a YouTube channel from a Mighty Network, YouTube is collecting personal information according to the YouTube privacy policy.
10. Integrated services
One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you as a Member to enable various online Third Party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook and LinkedIn (each, an ‚ÄúIntegrated Service‚Äù), to integrate directly into your Mighty Network. By directly integrating these services, we make your use of Mighty Networks richer and more personalized. To enable Integrated Services, we will ask you to authorize Mighty Networks to access the Integrated Services (or vice versa). When you add an Integrated Service account to a Mighty Network (or vice versa), your log-in information, Personal Data, non-personal data, location information, your content, your Mighty Network name, your Mighty Network location, your Mighty Network affiliation, profile photo, Facebook Connect ID, Profile (if you are integrating your Facebook account) and other relevant personal information may be passed through to, or received from, the Integrated Service in connection with your use of the Service. We may import, use, disclose, and retain such data and information to, among other things, customize and improve the Service for you and others. Note that Integrated Services may also import, use, and retain this information. You may be able to control how certain information is shared with us in your privacy settings within the Integrated Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Integrated Services collect, use, store, and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of the companies operating those Integrated Services, and we shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.
If you have elected to integrate your Mighty Networks with an Integrated Service, we may share your information with Integrated Services. This may happen when you first register with Mighty Networks, when you log into Mighty Networks from time to time, or in emails or other communications we may send you consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may from time to time share your Personal Data and anonymous data, your location information, your Mighty Network Membership, your Mighty Network URL, your location, and your use of certain features on Mighty Networks with Integrated Services to facilitate and enhance your use of the Integrated Services. Please keep in mind that services provided by Integrated Services are not provided by us and therefore your use of the Integrated Services will be governed by the Integrated Services‚Äô Terms of Use and other policies, and that the collection, use, and disclosure of information provided by you or us to Integrated Services is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
11. Security of Your Personal Data
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures including encryption, aggregation, and pseudonymization to protect your Personal Data provided via the Service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email, or other electronic transmission is ever 100% secure or error free, so we cannot guarantee that your Personal Data will never be accessed, used, or disclosed, so you should take special care in deciding what information you share on the Service.
‚ÄúPhishing‚Äù is a scam designed to steal your Personal Data or Information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for information about you, please contact us at
help@mightynetworks.com
.
12. Your state privacy rights; additional details for all users
Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia should review the
California Privacy Notice
for more information about your rights and our compliance with California privacy laws.
Even if you are not a resident of these states, we encourage you to review the California Privacy Notice for more details on how we collect and share your Personal Information.
13. Your EU/ EEA/ UK privacy rights
Our Service is provided from within the United States and subject to state and federal laws of the United States. If you are located outside the United States, your Personal Data is being transferred to, stored, used, and shared in the United States.
If you are a resident of the EU/ EEA or UK, please see our
EU/ EEA/ UK Privacy Notice
for more information about your rights and our compliance with applicable laws.

dpo@mightynetworks.com

Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data to us. We will also place any updates on our website. This privacy policy was last updated on the date indicated at the top of this document.
16. Conflicting Provisions in Hosts‚Äô Privacy Policies
We have no liability or responsibility for the privacy policies or practices of our Hosts or other actions of any Integrated Service that may be enabled within the Service.

Mighty Networks California Privacy Notice
Last updated: December 22, 2021
This California Privacy Notice supplements our
Mighty Networks Privacy Policy
and applies solely to all Visitors (visitors, Members and Hosts) to our Services (website and app) who reside in the State of California (‚Äùyou‚Äù). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice. Please note that the definition of ‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù in the CCPA is not the same as ‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù in our Mighty Networks Privacy Policy, because the California definition extends to information that can reasonably identify a household, not just actually identify individuals. As defined by the CCPA and used in this California Privacy Notice, ‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù refers to ‚Äúinformation that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.‚Äù
This California Privacy Notice is not intended to apply to Personal Information we collect about employees, applicants for employment, or business partners.
1. Summary
The CCPA requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of Personal Information that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties with whom we share it.
2. California Notice of Collection and Use
We or our service providers may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:
To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your name and contact information to ask a question about our Services, we will use that Personal Information to respond to your inquiry.
To provide, support, personalize, and develop our Services.
To create, maintain, customize, and secure your Member or Host account with us.
To provide you with support and to respond to your inquiries, including to investigate and address your concerns and monitor and improve our responses.
To personalize your Services experience and to deliver content and product and service offerings relevant to your interests.
For testing, research, analysis, and product development, including to develop and improve our Services.
To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
As described to you when collecting your Personal Information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Mighty Software‚Äôs assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us about our Members and Hosts is among the assets transferred.
We will not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.
3. Categories of Personal Information, Sources, and Third Parties We Share It With
The table below identifies the categories of Personal Information that we collect now and have collected over the past twelve months, and provides examples of Personal Information in each category. It also identifies the sources of the Personal Information, and the categories of third parties we share it with. If you share Personal Information in your Mighty Network, under the CCPA, such information is considered ‚Äúcollected‚Äù by us even though we did not ask for it. As we explain in our Mighty Networks Privacy Policy: If you include personal information in Your Content, it will be displayed to other Members based on the privacy levels of the Network. Your Content means all material that you upload, publish, or display to others via a Mighty Network. Please note that Your Content is stored by us because we store all of the material posted in Mighty Networks. Your Content is not information that we actively collect from you.
