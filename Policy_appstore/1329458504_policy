Please kindly note that, if you choose to share control over your Device with an App account other than yours, the data collected from your Device during the control by another App account holder will also be recorded under the name of such App account.
Please note certain models of Ecovacs Device is equipped with a vision sensor and microphone to enable some product functions or services (please refer to the product manuals to know whether your Device has such functions, how to turn on / off such functions (if applicable)). The data we actually collect depends on the context of your interactions with Ecovacs and the choices you make (including your privacy settings), the products and functions you use, your location, and applicable laws. Function-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those product functions or services.
(4)
Voice Interaction System (not applicable to lawn mower robot)
If your Device is equipped with a Voice Interaction Systems, you can instruct your Device by using your voice. To recognize your commands, the Device relies on microphones that are active anytime. However, the Voice Interaction System is only “listening” after it recognized that you said “Okay, Yiko” (the “
Signal Word
”) and begins to record your command. As long as you did not say the Signal Word, the Device will ignore all sounds captured by the microphone.  A flashing light and an acoustic signal indicate that the recording is in progress. The Device will not store any noise recordings without indication.
The Device is able to process certain commands locally and without a connection to the internet. In the event the Device does not understand the command, it transfers an edited version of the recording furnished with your unique Ecovacs User-ID to a cloud environment operated by us (the “
Ecovacs Cloud
”).  The Ecovacs Cloud is hosted on Servers in the United States. To process the command, we apply a speech recognition system, which automatically converts your command into written text.
We use the voice recordings to make the Device execute your commands.  In particular, we will neither make the voice recordings available to any third parties, if this is not necessary to deliver the Voice Interaction System to you nor try to determine, from whom the voice command comes from or to identify you by your voice”). The recordings are furnished with a unique ID to associate the recording with the correct user account/Device. From the Ecovacs Cloud the recordings including the identifier is further transmitted to Microsoft Azure for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service. For some models of device, we also use Google Dialogflow for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text to Speech (TTS) services.  The speech recognition system translates the voice recording into text and transmits the transcript back to the Ecovacs Cloud. The Ecovacs Cloud translates the text into a command and sends the command to the Device. If the Device does not recognize the command, the process will start again. If the device still does not recognize the command, the Device asks the user questions to identify the user’s wishes. The transcripts of your command will be stored in the Evovacs Cloud.  Microsoft Azure is operated by Microsoft Corporation, 920 Fourth Avenue, Suite 2900, Seattle, Washington 95104, US (“
Microsoft
”). To provide the ASR services, Microsoft does not need to store your voice recordings, unless you opting in the
“
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
”
and consent in using and storing your data to train the AI model. In this condition, Microsoft will be entrusted to store your data to train the AI models. Google Dialogflow is operated by Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City II Singapore 117371 (“
Google
”).  Google stores the recordings and your data in datacenters located in USA.
The processing described in this section is necessary to provide you with the Voice Interactions System of your Device as part of our contractual arrangements. The Voice Interaction System is turned off by default.  To use the Voice Interaction System, you are required to turn it on when you set up the device or at a later stage. You can turn off the Voice Interaction System in the Device controls. When you turned off the Voice Interactions System you may no longer be able to operate your Device with voice commands.
To improve the speech recognition, you can view the transcripts and give feedback on the accuracy of the recognition of your command. For the same purpose, if you participate in the “
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
”, your transcripts and voice recordings will be transferred to China for manual review, analysis, annotation, AI model trainings, for better understanding of the Signal Word and voice commands, reduce the possibility of false activation and provide more accurate voice recognition services.  This work may be conducted by Ecovacs employees or third party service suppliers who are working on Ecovacs’ behalf. In this condition, the voice recordings will be stored in the Ecovacs local server allocated in China. To ensure that your personal information is safe, we will take necessary and reasonable data protection measures when transferring your personal data outside your jurisdiction on the premise of providing appropriate safeguards in accordance with the legal requirements in your jurisdiction. The processing described in the “
User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System
” relies on your explicit consent. This function is turned off by default.  You can choose to opt in or opt out of this program freely by clicking the button “Settings-Privacy-Data Authorization Settings- User Experience Improvement Plan for Voice Interaction System” within the App.
(5)
Object Recognition
In case your Device is equipped with a vision sensor, it is able to recognize obstacles around and thereby decide its work route during its operation.  The vision sensor monitors the work environment of the Device and compares the obstacles it encounters against the objects in the database stored on the Device.  The Device can only distinguish between different types of objects (e.g., whether the obstacle is a chair or a table).  It does not enable the Device to tell one person from another.
Obstacle Recognition is executed locally on the Device. The footage taken by the vision sensor is in high resolution. It possibly involves the collection and processing of your personal information and might enable identification of individuals in the work environment, depending upon what is revealed in such photos/videos. To eliminate the possibility to identify a person appearing on the Device, the Device blurs the areas of the footage, where it detects the shape of a human body.
This information is necessary to provide you with the functionalities of the improved obstacle recognition to enable the Device to find the most efficient work route and to determine the areas already worked, insofar as the footage shows you as the user of the App.  If the footage shows other persons (e.g., your family members or guests), it is necessary to pursue your legitimate interests to enjoy the best work results of your Device.
When you setup your Device, object recognition is turned off by default and your App will ask you, whether you want to use this functionality. You can change your settings and turn the object recognition on or off at your discretion by referring to Device Controls.  Turning off the object recognition may impair the results and efficiency of the work routines of the Device.
The data is stored on the device side only. Only if the user turns on the “User Experiences Improvement Plan” and the data transmitted to the cloud. However, the personal information (human shape/face) contained in the pictures has been blurred out beforehand. This ensures that it is not possible to identify an individual.
The data is stored on the device side only. Only if the user turns on the “
User Experiences Improvement Plan
” and the data transmitted to the cloud. However, the personal information (human shape/face) contained in the pictures has been blurred out beforehand. This ensures that it is not possible to identify an individual
If object recognition is turned on and the Device is unable to recognize an object, the Device will take a picture of the object, send it to your App and ask for your consent that the image will be sent to us in the People’s Republic of China for further processing. The transmission of the image to your App takes place via WiFi. If the Device recognized that the image shows a person, the Device automatically blurs the area showing the person. If you consented to sending the picture to us, we will try to identify the object by applying artificial intelligence technologies.  Before the image is transmitted to us, you may also add remarks to it to help us identifying the object. Only if the artificial intelligence is also unable to identify the object, the image may be manually reviewed by employees from one of our affiliates located in the People’s Republic of China. We will then store the image in our database to train the artificial intelligence and further improve obstacle recognition. Information captured for obstacle recognition is only transferred to us in the aforementioned cases and after your consent.  The processing of the images relies on your consent. In all other cases, the information captured by the vision sensor for obstacle recognition will neither be stored on the Device nor transmitted to us and/or your App.
(6)
Real-Time Video Calls
For some models of the Device, you may be able to view through the App videos and sounds taken in a real-time manner and/or their records, in this case, your Device can act as a visual monitor. To make the footage available to you, regardless whether you are at home or not, the Device streams the footage to your App via the internet.
To make persons in the surrounding aware that this function is active, a signal light mounted on the Device starts blinking and an acoustic signal sounds regularly. If you are near the Device and you do not want to be monitored by the Device, you can abort the transmission by pressing a button on the Device. In some local areas, recording third persons’ voice or making videos of them could violate the law. Before you use this function, please make yourself aware that you use the Device in accordance with the local laws applicable in your area. Please familiarize any third parties who might appear on the footage (e.g., your family members or guests) that they may be recorded by the Device and how they can abort the transmission.
The transmissions of the voice recordings and/or the images is necessary to provide you with this functionality upon your request.  If the images and/or the recordings are taken from you, processing this information is necessary for the fulfillment of the contractual relationship with you and if they are taken from somebody else, it relies on pursuing your legitimate interest to monitor your home. Please note that monitoring public areas may violate local laws applicable in your country and ensure that you use the function in line with your local requirements.
The voice function described in this article (6) is not applicable to lawn mower robot.
(7)
Remote Camera
When your Device is equipped with a camera sensor, you may also instruct the Device to save the images captured by the camera sensor. This function only allows you to save footage presented to you when you use the Real Time Video Call function (Regarding lawn mower robot, this function only allows you to save images when using the video module to view the surroundings of the lawn mower robot, and to save images during Multi-Spot guarding). To make the pictures accessible to you via the App, they are stored in the Ecovacs Cloud. You may also download the pictures to the smartphone on which you installed the App for your further use. The pictures stored by the remote camera function will be saved until you request us to delete them, when your storage is full or when you cancel your App account.
Storing the images is necessary to deliver the remote camera function to you.  If the images and/or the recordings are taken from you, processing this information is necessary for the fulfillment of the contractual relationship with you and if they are taken from somebody else relies on pursuing your legitimate interest to monitor your home.
(8)
Security Alert and Spot Guarding (applies only to lawn mower)
Depending on your model, lawn-mowing robots may notify you when somebody enters the area of operation of the Device (“Security Alert”) or a specific area designated by you (“Spot Guarding Function”).  If those functions are active, the Device constantly monitors the respective area.  In case the Device detects an object, it analyses, whether the object is a human being.  If the Device detects, the Device will take a picture of the person and send it with a push notification to your phone via the App.  The Device is not able to recognize a specific person.  It is technically it is possible that the monitored area exceeds the area of operation and/or your property.  According to some local laws it could be prohibited to monitor public areas.  Please make sure that you use the Device in line with local requirements applicable in your area.  We will not use the information obtained for any other purposes than supplying the function to you and to pursue your legitimate interests to protect your property from trespassing.
(9)
3D Maps (not applicable to lawn mower)
Some Devices use laser technology to measure your home and compile 3D Models of your home and your furniture.  From the 3D Models, the Device creates 3D Maps, including the layout of your home and the size and position of your furniture.  The 3D Models will not be combined with images taken by the camera sensor and does not allow us to identify persons in the surrounding of the Device.  You can view the 3D Maps in your App and correct errors in the 3D Maps or determine areas, where the Device should or should not clean.  We only use the 3D Maps to make the cleaning routines of the Device more efficient and to make the areas that have already been cleaned apparent to you via the App.  We retain the 3D Maps until they are overwritten by a newer version, the Device recognizes that it is used in a new home or you cancel your App account.  3D Maps is active by default and is necessary to operate the Device in your home.  Without 3D Maps the Device would not be able to determine, which areas already have been cleaned or still need to be cleaned.
You may also add details of your furniture. Adding furniture details is voluntarily.  Not adding furniture details does not influence the performance of the Device.  We use the furniture details only, to pursue our legitimate interests to make your user experience of the App more comfortable and personal.
(10)
Device Sharing.
The Device allows to be used and controlled over the App by more than one user, if this is enabled by the user who paired the App with the Device for the first time (the “
Main Account Holder
”), activated this functionality and invites further users to control the Device through their App (the “
Sub Account Holders
”).  Both, the Main Account Holder and the Sub Account Holder are required to hold an App Account. If Device Sharing is activated and several users share the control over the Device, the Main Account Holder and the Sub Account Holder will be presented the email addresses of each other.  This processing is necessary to offer you the Device Sharing functionality and to perform an existing agreement with you. If you are the Main Account Holder, please make sure that the Sub Account Holder agrees with receiving your invitation.  The invitation for Device Sharing expires one week after the receipt.  If you do not accept the invitation, the information about the invitation will be deleted after the expiry of the invitation period.  The Main Account Holder will be provided with a list of the Sub Account Holders, who accepted the invitation including the date of Acceptance and the Sub Account Holder’s user name.  Besides that, neither the Main Account Holder may access further information from the Sub Account Holders nor may the Sub Account Holders access information from the Main Account Holder or other Sub Account Holders.  If you are the Sub Account Holder, please note that the Main Account Holder can withdraw your opportunity of Device Sharing anytime.  In this case, you will no longer be able to control the relevant Device anymore or access the information stored therein.  To operate the Device Sharing option, we use your email address, your App Account details and an identifier that connects your App with the Device.  Using this information is necessary to deliver the Device Sharing function to you upon your request.
Please kindly note that, if you choose to share control over your Device with an App account other than yours, the data collected from your Device during the control by another App account holder will also be recorded under the name of such App account.
