In Short:

We ensure that these legal bases are applied consistently, transparently, and in a manner that respects your privacy.
If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
Consent.
We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. This consent will always be informed, freely given, and explicit where required by law. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent
.
Performance of a Contract.
We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. This includes enabling core functionalities of our Services or delivering personalized features based on your usage.
Legitimate Interests.
We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services
Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users
Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

Vital Interests.
We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as responding to emergencies, mitigating security threats, or addressing situations involving immediate threats to life or safety.
If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). In either case, we ensure that the consent is consistent with Canadian privacy laws and principles. You can
withdraw your consent
at any time.
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
For business transactions provided certain conditions are met, such as due diligence processes during mergers or acquisitions
If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
In Short:
We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.
Our servers are located in Netherlands, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and other EU countries. If you are accessing our Services from outside Netherlands, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and other EU countries, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see “WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?” above), in the Netherlands, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, other EU countries, and other countries. We take steps to ensure that your information is handled securely and in accordance with this privacy notice, regardless of where it is processed. This includes leveraging industry-standard encryption protocols, secure server configurations, and stringent access controls.
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses:
We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses are legally binding safeguards that ensure your data is treated with the same level of protection required by EEA and UK data protection laws. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. We maintain a documented data transfer assessment for these mechanisms to verify compliance and address evolving regulatory requirements. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short:
We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). We periodically review our data retention policies to ensure compliance with changing laws and evolving best practices, minimizing unnecessary data storage. No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. However, certain data, such as payment records or transaction details, may be retained for longer durations to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We also ensure that any archived information is securely encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized parties.
If you have questions about specific retention periods for your personal information, or if you wish to request deletion, you may contact us at support@talkpal.ai.
10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
In Short:
We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption protocols, secure socket layer (SSL) technology, regular security audits, multi-factor authentication, and strict access controls for sensitive data. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. We strongly recommend that you use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and take additional precautions such as enabling multi-factor authentication when available. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. Avoid using public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks when accessing our Services to minimize potential risks.

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. We may also restrict access to the Services until age verification is completed.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below or updating your preferences.
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
In Short: Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard or regulatory framework for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. While some third-party services we utilize may independently honor DNT requests, we currently do not guarantee that all data collection activities across our Services adhere to these settings. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, or if we update our practices to align with evolving technology standards or legal requirements, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

Verification process
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. Verification is essential to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may:
Ask you to provide specific details, such as your name, email address, account information, or recent transactions made through our Services.
Contact you through a communication method (e.g., email or phone) that you have previously provided to us.
Use multifactor authentication, such as sending a verification code to your registered email or phone number, to confirm your identity.
Request additional documentation if necessary, such as a government-issued ID or proof of address, to validate your identity for sensitive or high-risk requests.
In some cases, we may rely on third-party identity verification services to enhance the security and efficiency of the verification process.
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. This information will not be used for any other purpose unless required by law. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may:
Request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
Inform you of why the information provided was insufficient to complete the verification process and guide you on next steps.
We take your privacy seriously and have implemented strict security measures to protect any additional information provided during the verification process. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you. If we cannot complete the verification process after reasonable efforts, we may decline the request and inform you of your options, including how to appeal the decision.
