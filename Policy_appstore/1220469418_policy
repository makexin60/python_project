                    identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored
                    on your computer's hard drive.

                    when a cookie is set.
InterPals uses its own cookies for a number of
                    purposes, including to:
- Require you to re-enter your password after a
                    certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally
                    accessing your account contents.

                    their own privacy policies, and not this policy. Advertisers or other entities
                    do not have access to InterPals.net's cookies.
Information Relating to Children
Protecting the
                    privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, InterPals does
                    not knowingly collect personally identifiable information through the InterPals web
                    site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of InterPals service is
                    directed to persons under 13.

When you provide personal
                    information through using InterPals you are however sharing your personal
                    information with InterPals.net and its affiliated entities. The use of your
                    personal information by these organizations is subject to this policy.
We do not share your information with unrelated third parties for their
                    direct marketing purposes. However, InterPals may display targeted advertisements
                    based on personally non-identifiable information (such as browser type and IP
                    address) and/or personal selection (See the Section entitled Third Party
                    Advertising below for more information on how your information is
                    shared with advertisers).

                    operate or improve the InterPals products and services, to do something
                    that you have asked us to do, or tell you of products and services that
                    we think may be of interest.
From time to time, InterPals.net or a
                    partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on InterPals. You
                    may be asked to provide personal information including name, email
                    address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate.
                    InterPals.net may transfer personal information to certain advertising
                    partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from.
                    It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the
                    personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
Where you are contacted with an offer or service based on
                    information you have shared with InterPals, we will do our best to provide
                    you with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such further
                    communications at the time you are contacted, however, in connection
                    with any of our paid products and services (i.e., products or services
                    that you license or use for a fee), we reserve the right to send
                    you certain communications relating to those products and services, such
                    as service announcements, and administrative messages, that are
                    considered part of your InterPals.net account, without offering you the
                    opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

                    InterPals, InterPals.net collects user-submitted account information such as
                    name, email address and age to identify users and send notifications

                    user-submitted profile information, including additional contact
                    information, location, biographical information and photos. This
                    additional profile information will assist other users in finding and
                    communicating with you.
InterPals will display your "Display Name"

                    user-submitted profile information on your profile according to the
                    preferences you set in your account.
Email addresses and full
                    names may be used when a user invites a friend via email to join InterPals
                    and when InterPals sends notifications to a user related to their use of
                    InterPals.
When you post a message on a InterPals Site, you have the
                    ability to post a message which may include personally identifiable
                    information about yourself.
If you post personal information
                    online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited
                    messages from other parties in return.
InterPals.net may share
                    personally identifiable information about you under the following
                    circumstances:
In the course of operating our business it may
                    be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your personal
                    information to others such as our service providers, contractors and
                    select vendors so that we can operate InterPals and our business.
We may share your personal information to respond to subpoenas,
                    court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal
                    rights or, defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in such
                    circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate.
We may
                    share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order
                    to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
                    suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
                    safety of any person, violations of our various terms of use, or as
                    otherwise required by law.
As we continue to develop our
                    business, we may also buy or sell all or part of our business. In such
                    transactions, personally identifiable information you have shared with
                    us is generally one of the business assets that will be transferred. The
                    transferred personally identifiable information will remain subject to
                    the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent policies to which
                    you have consented.
Third Party Advertising
Advertisements appearing on the InterPals.net
            Sites, Product or Services may be delivered to users by InterPals.net or
            one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may
            set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your
            computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way,
            ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are
            using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads
            are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver
            targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to
            you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by InterPals.net and
            does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
InterPals.net
                does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers.
                InterPals.net may share general demographic information (such as aggregated
                statistics about members' interests and occupations) and
                non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP
                addresses) with advertisers and partners. InterPals.net does not
                give advertisers access to your individual personal account information.
                However, by selecting, interacting with or viewing an ad you are
                consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the
                assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the
                ad.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
                Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address
                email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other
                Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
                interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to
                know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,

.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
InterPals.net may revise, modify or update this policy. We may notify you
                about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by
                sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your
                particular InterPals.net account or by placing a prominent notice on our
                site. You are encouraged to check this policy frequently for any changes
                as your continued use of the InterPals service indicates your consent to
                such changes.
Confidentiality and Security
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
                secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
                information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we
                receive your information, we take reasonable measures to secure it on
                our systems.
If InterPals.net learns of a security systems breach we
                may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
                appropriate protective steps. By using InterPals or providing personal
                information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
                electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues
                relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post
                a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If
                this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the
                applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email
                address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on
                where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a
                security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security
                breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice)
                you should notify us at
privacy@InterPals.net
.
Changing your
                    Preferences and Personal Information
You can edit your account
                information with InterPals at any time. Most personal information you may
                provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents are
                considering whether to permit their children to use Interpals, we do not
                condition a child's participation based upon their provision of any more
                personal information than is necessary to operate those sites, products and
                services.
You can delete your applicable account by visiting the
                applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some personal
                information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records
                to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document
                compliance with regulatory requirements.
Personal data processing and deletion of personal data
Interpals collects personal user data when a user creates or edits an account. This
                information includes name, birthday, gender, current city, home city, email address and
                other data voluntarily supplied by the user including photographs and description text.
                This data is stored on Interpals servers and a subset of it is made public to other users
                on the site via a user's public profile. Non-public data including email and passwords are
                used for authentication purposes and for notifications.
In compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR),
                at a user's request, Interpals will delete all user data from its servers. To request data
                deletion, a user must send an email to
support@interpals.net
requesting "Permanent data deletion" and including the username of the profile in question. If the
                email is received from an email address other than the one used to register the account, supplemental
                identity verification will be required.
You can delete your applicable account by visiting the
                applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some personal
                information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records
                to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document
                compliance with regulatory requirements.
