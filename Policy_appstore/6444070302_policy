More low-latency than ever
There has yet to be a breakthrough in scalable low latency solutions until now. InPlay’s SMULL (Synchronized Multi-node Ultra Low-Latency) technology can help you achieve a fraction of the latency compared to today’s wireless technologies.
Every microwatt counts
Power consumption has always been a prime concern for wireless devices. InPlay’s NanoBeacon SoC sets a new standard for high RF performance while maintaining ultra low-power consumption at the microwatt level with no firmware required.
Enabling the next wave of IIoT applications
Unlock the full potential of your IIoT applications. With InPlay’s SDR (Software Defined Radio) protocol for edge networking, you can scale up to thousands of nodes in a single star topology with bi-directional communications, all without compromising performance.
