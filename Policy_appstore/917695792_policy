1. Scope of applicability
The following General Terms and Conditions shall apply to all orders placed via our online store by consumers and entrepreneurs ("GTC").
A consumer means every natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that predominantly are outside his trade, business or profession. An entrepreneur means a natural or legal person or a partnership with legal personality who or which, when entering into a legal transaction, acts in exercise of his or its trade, business or profession.
With respect to entrepreneurs, these GTC shall also apply to future business relationships without having to refer to them again. If the entrepreneur uses conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions, their applicability is hereby objected to. They shall only become part of the contract if we have expressly agreed to them.
2. Contractual partner, conclusion of contract, contract language
The purchase contract is concluded with Eve Systems GmbH.
The presentation of the products in the online store does not constitute a legally binding offer, but an invitation to order (invitatio ad offerendum).
First, you can add our products to the shopping cart without obligation by clicking on "buy now" or on "add to cart". If you want to complete the order, go to the shopping cart ("proceed to checkout"), where you will be guided through the rest of the ordering process. You will then have to log in with your personal access data (e-mail address and password) or create a new account. After selecting the item in the shopping cart and entering all necessary order and address data, you will be redirected to an order overview, in which the essential product details, including any costs incurred, are summarized once again. You can correct your entries at any time before sending your binding order by using the correction tool provided and explained for this purpose in the ordering process.
Only by clicking the order button "order and pay" in the last step of the ordering process or only by confirming the payment, you place a binding order of the goods contained in the shopping cart and agree to the validity of these General Terms and Conditions.
The confirmation of your order receipt will be sent by e-mail immediately after submitting the order and does not constitute an acceptance of the contract. If a product is not available, you will be informed of the unavailability before your order is accepted by Eve Systems and you will be offered a replacement item of the same price and quality if possible. Payments already received will be refunded immediately. A contract between you and us is concluded as soon as we accept your order by a separate e-mail (order confirmation or dispatch confirmation) or release the goods for dispatch. Please check the spam folder of your e-mail account regularly.
Eve Systems GmbH is entitled to withdraw from the contract if there is an important reason of which we only became aware after conclusion of the contract. An important reason exists in particular if you are in arrears with a payment or if a party culpably violates an essential obligation assumed in this contract and does not remedy the violation within the set period despite a warning with a reasonable deadline.
For orders with customized specifications (e.g. Eve Blinds Collection), there is no right of cancellation or withdrawal because they are made according to customer specifications or are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the customer.
Moreover, you can pay for our products directly using PayPal or Apple Pay by clicking on "checkout with PayPal" or "checkout with Apple Pay". Hence, you do not need a customer account on our website. As soon as you click on the payment button ("Apple Pay", "checkout with PayPal"), you submit a binding contractual offer. When the contract with us will be concluded depends on the method of payment you have chosen:
PayPal, PayPal Express

Insofar as Eve Systems replaces goods within the scope of claims for defects, the transfer of ownership of the subsequently delivered goods shall be subject to the condition precedent that the customer returns the goods to be replaced or - if he is not in a position to do so - pays compensation for the value if the legal requirements are met.
The assignment of rights from contracts for the dispatch of goods and the transfer of these contracts as a whole by the customer require the prior consent of EVE Systems at least in text form.
Set-off or retention against claims of Eve Systems arising from these contracts or related non-contractual claims is only permitted with due counterclaims that are undisputed, legally established or ready for judgement or that are based on defects in the underlying service.
The following shall apply in addition to entrepreneurs: We shall retain title to the goods until all claims arising from an ongoing business relationship have been satisfied in full. You may resell the reserved goods in the course of your normal business operations. You shall assign to us, in advance, all claims arising from this resale, irrespective of any combination or intermixture of the reserved goods with a new thing, in the amount of the invoice amount, and we shall accept this assignment. You shall remain authorized to collect claims, but we may also collect claims ourselves if you fail to meet your payment obligations. If the value of all security rights to which we are entitled against you exceeds the amount of all secured claims by more than 20 %, we shall release a respective part of the security rights at your request. We shall be entitled to choose between different security rights for release.
6. Instructions on withdrawal

End of the withdrawal policy
7. Exclusion of the right of withdrawal
Unless otherwise specified, the right of withdrawal in accordance with Section 6 does not apply to distance contracts for the delivery of goods that are not prefabricated and for the manufacture of which an individual selection or determination by the consumer is decisive or which are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer, e.g. Eve Blinds Collection (§ 312g paragraph 1 in connection with. § 312g paragraph 2, No. 1 German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB).
8. Transport damages
Applies to consumers: If goods are delivered with obvious transport damages, please complain about such damage to the deliverer as soon as possible and contact us immediately. Failure to make a complaint or contact us shall have no consequences for your statutory claims and their enforcement, in particular your warranty rights. However, they help us to be able to assert our own claims against the carrier or transport insurance.
Applies to entrepreneurs: The risk of accidental destruction and accidental deterioration shall pass to you as soon as we have handed the thing over to the forwarder, carrier or other person or body specified to carry out the shipment. The obligation of examination and notice of defects set forth in § 377 German Commercial Code "HGB" shall apply to merchants. If you fail to report a defect regulated in the aforementioned paragraph, the goods shall be deemed to have been accepted, unless the defect was not detectable during the examination. This shall not apply if we have fraudulently concealed the defect.

For consumers, the limitation period of claims for defects in the case of second-hand things is one year upon delivery of the goods.
For entrepreneurs, the limitation period of claims for defects is one year upon the passing of the risk. The statutory limitation periods for the right of recourse according to § 478 German Civil Code "BGB" shall remain unaffected.
With respect to entrepreneurs, only our own statements and the manufacturer’s product descriptions included in the contract shall be deemed to be an agreement on the nature of the goods. We shall not assume any liability for the manufacturer’s public statements or other advertising statements.
If the delivered thing is defective, we shall initially provide a warranty to entrepreneurs, at our choice, by remedying the defect (repair) or by delivering a thing free of defects (replacement delivery).
The above limitations and shortened periods shall not apply to claims based on damages caused by us, our legal representatives or vicarious agents
in the event of an injury to life, body or health
in the event of an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty as well as fraudulent intent
in the event of a violation of essential contractual obligations, whose fulfilment enables the proper performance of the contract and on whose compliance the contractual partner may regularly rely (cardinal obligations)
in the context of a promise of guarantee if agreed
where the scope of the German Product Liability Act "ProdHaftG" is applicable
in the case of liability under mandatory law.
Information on any additional guarantees that may apply and their specific terms and conditions can be found with the product and on special information pages in the store.
