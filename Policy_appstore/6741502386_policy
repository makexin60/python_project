Privacy POlicy
Local AI Chat (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding user data.
No Data Collection
• User Data: Local AI Chat does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, location data, or any other user-generated content to external servers or third parties. All data you create or manage within the app remains on your device.
If a feature requires that data be shared externally, only the requited data will be used and the user will be informed and prompted before doing so. They will also have the ability to opt-out of the feature and disable it if they choose.
Data Usage
• On-Device Storage: Any data related to your travel history, calendar entries, or personal records is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not shared or backed up externally unless you choose to export it yourself.
Security
• Local Data: Since all data is stored on your device and not transmitted elsewhere, your data security depends on your device’s security measures. We recommend that you protect your device with strong passwords and keep your software updated.
Children’s Privacy
• No Data Collection: As no data is collected or transmitted by Local AI Chat, there are no specific considerations for children’s data.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
• Policy Updates: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app’s settings, and you will be notified of significant changes.
