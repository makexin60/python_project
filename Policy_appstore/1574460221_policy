State Privacy Disclosure Notice
For residents protected under State Privacy Laws (including Nevada, solely for the "Nevada Residents Notice" section), this State Privacy Disclosure Notice supplements our Privacy Policy by providing additional details as mandated by such laws. The term "State Privacy Laws" refers to, as applicable, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act.
Your Privacy Rights
Contingent upon your state of residence, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws regarding the personal information we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations outlined in such laws, including exceptions or our inability to verify your identity):
Right of Access
The State Privacy Laws grant you the right to confirm whether we are processing your personal information and to access that personal data. You also have the right to obtain that personal information in a portable, readily usable format, unless providing it in such a format is technically infeasible.
Specifically concerning the CCPA's right of access, you can request:
the precise personal information the business has collected about you, and
the categories of personal information collected, the sources of collection, the business/commercial purpose for collecting or "selling/sharing" personal information, and the categories of third parties to whom the business discloses personal information.
Right to Deletion
You have the right to request the deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions under the State Privacy Laws.
Right to Correction
You have the right to request the correction of inaccuracies in your personal information, considering the nature of the personal information and the purposes of processing your personal information.
Opt-Out Rights
Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of "sales" and "shares" of personal information, "targeted advertising," and certain use/disclosure of "sensitive" personal information.
As further detailed in our Privacy Policy, we disclose the following to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners (e.g., advertisers/agencies, social media networks, adtech partners, customer intelligence firms) for advertising and marketing purposes, including direct marketing: Identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, internet or other network information, and data that may be considered "sensitive" personal information under certain State Privacy Laws. Please refer to our "Your Privacy Choices" link (found in the website footer) to exercise your opt-out rights accordingly.
We do not have actual knowledge of "selling" or "sharing" personal information of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.
Non-Discrimination and Appeals
You have the right to not receive "discriminatory" treatment for exercising the rights discussed above. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
Furthermore, under Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia's State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request. All appeals should be submitted by emailing
contact.justfit@enerjoy.life
, along with a copy of the decision you are appealing.
Authorized Agents
In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), where we can verify the authorized agent's authority to act on your behalf.
Specifically, under the CCPA, for requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we require the following for verification purposes:
(a) a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or(b) sufficient evidence to show that you have:
1. provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and
2. verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
For requests to opt-out of "sales," "shares," or the processing of your personal information for "targeted advertising" under the State Privacy Laws, we require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Deidentified Information
Where we process "deidentified information" (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintaining and using the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.
Notice at Collection for California Residents
The following serves as an official notice regarding the collection and use of personal information from California residents, in line with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):Over the past 12 months, we have gathered various categories of personal data, as outlined below.
