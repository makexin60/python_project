This International Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice (
“International Notice”)
is posted by
Prodege, LLC, a California limited liability company (together with any affiliates, “
we
“, “
us
“, and “
our
” and the “
Company
”), which
owns and operates one or more websites, mobile apps, and interactive services, under the brand
names
Swagbucks, Swagbucks Daily Trivia, InboxPounds, Daily Rewards, ySense, Pollfish, Poll Pay, Easy Bucks, Gopinion, BitBurst, AdGate Media, Prodege.com, and others
that post this International Notice (collectively, the “
Prodege Sites
“), and applies to the Prodege Sites and to all of the features, mobile applications, emails, online services and other functionalities (collectively, the “
Features
“) available via or related to the Prodege Sites, whether accessed via a computer, mobile device, or otherwise (collectively, the “
Prodege Sites and Features
“). This International Notice applies only to international (non-U.S.) users of the Prodege Sites and Features, and United States users of the Prodege Sites and Features are subject to and should review the U.S.
Privacy Policy
and
State Privacy Notice
instead.
This International Notice does not apply where we are processing information on behalf of another business as a processor, except as set forth in our
Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) Notice
, which you can view
here
. Users in the UK, EEA and Switzerland should also see our DPF Notice regarding transfers of their Personal Data (defined below) to the United States. Note that we may operate other sites and features that post different privacy policies and notices, in which case those posted policies and notices and not this notice shall apply, even if they otherwise share branding with the named Prodege Sites.
For the purposes of the U.K. Data Protection Act 1998 and the EU General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), we are the data controller; provided, however, if you use Features to interact with a third-party client or platform that party will be the controller of the Personal Data they collect. We are committed to protecting your privacy online. We appreciate that you do not want your Personal Data distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect Personal Data, what we do with it and what controls or choices you have.
“Personal Data”
has the meaning ascribed by data privacy laws to which we are subject as to each such jurisdiction, but generally means information that can identify you personally, directly or indirectly. By using the Prodege Sites and Features, you acknowledge the collection and use of information, and the processing of your Personal Data, in accordance with this International Notice. We reserve the right to change this International Notice from time to time by changing it on the Prodege Sites, in which case the version posted will govern your visit.
We may collect and process the following information about you:
information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number) that you provide by registering as a member or user of the Prodege Sites or otherwise completing a user profile or other forms via the Prodege Sites and Features;
information you upload or submit in relation to any sweepstakes, contests or promotions (collectively, “
Promotions
“) that may be offered via the Prodege Sites and Features;
information you upload or submit in relation to any rewards programs that we offer (collectively, “
Rewards Programs
“);
in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;
details of any shopping or other transactions made by you through the Prodege Sites and Features;
communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Prodege Sites and Features; or
information from surveys that we may, from time to time, present on the Prodege Sites and Features for research purposes, whether for ourselves or for third-party research companies, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them.
This information may include your Personal Data, in which case our commitments and your rights outlined in this International Notice shall apply. However, to the extent the information is not Personal Data, or is made to not be Personal Data, we shall not be limited in our use and disclosure of such non-Personal Data except as might be required by applicable law. You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all services available on or through the Prodege Sites and Features (the “
Services
”).
When you visit or use the Prodege Sites, we may, by means of cookies and/or other similar technologies (
“Tracking Technologies”
), automatically collect additional information about you – such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the Prodege Sites, your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer or mobile device on the internet) and/or the operating system of your computer or mobile device. See Section 3 ("Cookies and Other Technologies")
for more information on how we process said information and to set your preferences.
We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as a “Tell a Friend” programme, that invite you to get in touch with those of your contacts who may find our products or services to be of interest. Contacts made by these individuals that identify you as their referrer will trigger these programmes’ benefits.
If you choose to install and use optional Prodege Features such as browser extensions, add-ons or similar plug-in technologies (the
“Extensions”
), we may also collect and use your information in a variety of ways. For example, some of the Extensions allow you to shop directly with our merchant partners and earn rewards. If you install such an Extension, we may be able to determine automatically when you are visiting one of our merchant partners’ websites where our rewards may apply. If you install and use Extensions, we may also be able to determine when you are visiting other websites in order to assist us in determining which non-participating merchants are popular with our users and for other general business and analytical purposes regarding our members. In addition, to assist in rewarding you for purchases made through our shopping-rewards features, third-party affiliate or ad network Tracking Technologies may be placed on your computer when you install and use an Extension or when you click on an affiliate or ad network link within a shopping-rewards feature. Similarly, and subject to your consent, your browsing activity on our merchant partners’ websites and other websites may be tracked, and that information may be shared with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, or others, in order to provide you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, Promotions
(collectively, “
Offers
”)
, and rewards, or for other marketing, administrative and general business purposes, such as attribution, analytics and research.
We may collect information through the Prodege Sites and Features as to your real time geo-location to provide location-aware services where requested or agreed to by you in order to deliver content, advertising or other services that are dependent on knowing where you are. Where you have requested or agreed to location-aware services, this information may also be collected in combination with an identifier associated with your device to enable us to recognise your mobile browser or device when you return to the Prodege Sites and Features, which information is considered Personal Data in many jurisdictions. We may also, subject to your request or consent, share your location information with advertisers, merchants, and survey and other third-party partners, in order to provide you with reward opportunities, to locate participating stores or partners, and for other research, analytics and marketing purposes. You may provide and withdraw your consent for us to access your location data at any time by adjusting the settings on your mobile device. You can also stop all location data collection by un-installing all Prodege mobile apps, using the standard un-install processes for your mobile device.
When you interact with the Prodege Sites and Features, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit the Prodege Sites, a web server sends a cookie or other Tracking Technologies to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be). Tracking Technologies may also be present in the Prodege Sites and Features, such as mobile app SDKs (software development kits, i.e., certain code that enables tracking). Cookies and other Tracking Technologies are small pieces of information which are associated with or issued to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information. Some cookies we use may last only for the duration of your web or application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the Prodege Sites. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Prodege Sites and will last for longer. The cookies and/or other Tracking Technologies we use collect a variety of relevant information, such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, device attributes, any website from which you have come to the Prodege Sites, your IP address and/or the operating system of your computer or mobile device. We use cookies and/or other Tracking Technologies, such as tracking GIFs, web beacons, pixel codes and in-app IDs, either alone or in combination with each other, to create a unique device ID and to:
remember that you have visited us before. Among other things, this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive and make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
where necessary or otherwise permitted, track whether you have opened an email that we have sent to you and your related actions (e.g., linking to the Prodege Sites from the email);
customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Prodege Sites;
collect statistical information about how you use the Prodege Sites and Features (including how long you spend on the Prodege Sites) and where you have come to the Prodege Sites from, so that we can better understand and improve the Prodege Sites.
Some of the Tracking Technologies associated with the Prodege Sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties, such as companies that are delivering services or operating features on our behalf. You can set your cookie preferences, and obtain specific information on cookies (e.g., vendor, purpose, duration, etc.) by accessing our cookie management tool
here
.
Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies or other Tracking Technologies used on the Prodege Sites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Prodege Sites and Features including the tracking of data required for Promotions and Rewards Programs. To exercise your data protection rights, please see Section 13 ("Your Rights")
below. For additional information on how we process the information collected using cookies, please review this International Notice.
If you are a resident of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, please review Subsection B of our Supplemental Terms below
(“European Economic Area, UK, or Switzerland”).
Otherwise, we use your Personal Data and other information that we collect to:
enable us to provide you with the Services and information offered through the Prodege Sites and Features and which you request;
administer your account with us;
audit the downloading of the Prodege Sites and Features, as well as data from the Prodege Sites and Features;
improve the layout and/or content of the pages of the Prodege Sites and Features and customise them for users;
identify visitors to the Prodege Sites;
carry out research on our users’ demographics and behaviour;
send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our Services or the products and services of trusted third parties such as merchants, publishers, or market research companies, provided you have indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes;
at your request or with your consent, send your information to trusted third parties to facilitate your interactions with them in connection with Rewards Programs, and receive information about such interactions with them back from them in connection with Rewards Programs;
allow, at your request or with your consent, trusted third parties such as merchants, publishers, or market research companies to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding their products and services;
for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes; and
as otherwise reasonably related to our business, compatible with the collection purposes and not inconsistent with this International Notice or any notice at collection or prohibited by applicable law.
We may use your non-Personal Data for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law.
Some trusted third parties set requirements to participate in the Offers they sponsor on the Prodege Sites and Features. We collect and use Personal Data and other information about you, including responses to profile questions and other activity data, to determine if you qualify for these Offers. If you attempt such an Offer, we may use and disclose to trusted third parties: (a) your qualifications (e.g., profile data) and (b) your activity relating to the Offer itself (e.g., survey responses).  We do so at your direction, because this data is required for you to participate. If you want to avoid or limit this disclosure, you should stop participating and/or limit the information you provide us to qualify you. If you elect to participate and provide relevant qualification data, you direct us to disclose it to trusted third parties for purposes of qualifying you. You also authorize them to combine data about your Offer activity with any data used to qualify you.
We will seek your permission before contacting you with information regarding our Services or the products and services of third parties, or to share your details with third parties so that they can send you information regarding their products and services, at the point where such information is collected on the Prodege Sites (by checking the relevant box). Where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, follow the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also exercise this right at any time by contacting us using the method(s) described in Section 14 ("Contact Us") below
.
We may disclose aggregate statistics about users of the Prodege Sites in order to describe our business and Services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. We may disclose your Personal Data to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the Services we offer through the Prodege Sites and Features, processing transactions, viewing order references and/or order fulfillment requests and information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing professional advice, providing IT support services, providing security services, providing storage services and providing other support services, or in other tasks, from time to time. Our vendors and contractors will only use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold (or sell some or all of our assets) to a third party, Personal Data we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party. We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber-crime or to protect the Prodege Sites and Features or the rights, property or personal safety of any person. We may transfer your Personal Data to trusted third parties at your request or with your consent as more fully described in Section 4 (“
How Your Information is Used
”) above. We may share your non-Personal Data without limitation, except as prohibited by applicable law.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland, please see further information on the legal basis of these processing activities in Subsection B of our Supplemental Terms
below.
We will primarily receive Personal Data about you directly from you, for example, when you complete a form in which you provide details about you in one of our Features. We may also receive your Personal Data from trusted third parties in connection with your activities with them related to our Rewards Programs. We may transfer the Personal Data we collect about you to our servers and to data processors in the United States, where we are headquartered and in other countries. Where international transfers are restricted by applicable law, we may transfer Personal Data subject to contractual protections and other mechanisms under applicable law for the transfer of Personal Data. For instance, we are a certified participant in the US/UK/EU/CH Data Privacy Framework Program. For more information, see our DPF Notice available
here
. You may have the right to obtain additional information on the safeguards in place. Please see S
ection 14 ("Contact Us")
below for details on how to contact us.
Certain functionality on the Prodege Sites and Features may permit interactions that you initiate between the Prodege Sites and Features and a third-party website or service, such as Meta and X (“
Social Features
”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to “like” or “share” content from the Prodege Sites and Features with another website or service; to log-in to the Prodege Sites and Features using your username and password for a third-party website or service; to transmit content to the Prodege Sites and Features from your account on a third-party website or service; and to otherwise connect the Prodege Sites and Features to a third-party website or service. If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to may be shared with that third-party website or service and others, and may be publicly displayed on the Prodege Sites and Features or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references any of the Prodege Sites and Features (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with any of the Prodege Sites and Features in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the Prodege Sites and Features in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or service. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Prodege Sites and Features and the third-party website or service. The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this International Notice. The information collected and stored by any third-party website or service via Social Features remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices regarding what is visible to others on that third-party website or service.
The Prodege Sites and Features may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your Personal Data that you do not wish to be known publicly.
The Prodege Sites may, from time to time, contain links to merchants, market research companies, or other external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies, data practices or the content of such sites.
We place great importance on the security of all Personal Data associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Data under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we attempt to use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Prodege Sites and Features while it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk. If you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place, it is advisable to close your browser when you finish your user session to help ensure others do not access your Personal Data.
Personal Data that you submit via the Prodege Sites and Features is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America. We may further transfer it to our other offices and/or third parties, such as data processors, who may be situated in the United States of America or elsewhere outside the EEA/UK/CH, and/or subject it to processing by staff operating outside said territories (see Sections 5 and 6 above on
“Information Sharing” and “International Transfers”
).
We will retain your Personal Data only as long as we need it for the purpose for which we are processing it. Retention periods can vary based on the type of data and how it is used. For example, when you contact us with a complaint, query, or other concern, we will retain your information for as long as needed to respond to your query and maintain a business record of our response.
We implement our internal retention guidelines for Personal Data based on criteria that include legally mandated retention periods, pending or potential litigation, our intellectual property or ownership rights, contract requirements, operational directives or needs, and historical archiving. We will periodically review the Personal Data we hold and delete it securely, or in some cases anonymize it, when there is no longer a legal basis for processing it.
You may have the following rights with respect to your Personal Data, which apply differently in different circumstances and in different territories: right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure, right to restriction of processing, right to data portability, and the right to object to processing and to be informed.
Please see below for a brief description of each of these rights.
Access
: Upon request, you may be entitled to confirmation that we process your Personal Data and to a copy of your Personal Data.
Rectification
: If the Personal Data we hold about you is incorrect, you may have the right for it to be rectified.
Erasure
: You can request us to erase your Personal Data when there is no compelling reason for us to continue processing it, if we rely on your consent for the processing of your Personal Data and you withdraw your consent, we rely on legitimate interests for the processing and there are no overriding legitimate interests to continue the processing, we have to erase the information to comply with a legal obligation or we have processed the information unlawfully. Please note that if you exercise this right, we may necessarily have to close your account and your participation in any of our Rewards Programs, as we would be unable to continue to offer you our Services.
Restriction
: You may request a restriction on the processing we undertake on your Personal Data. This right will only apply if you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data and we are verifying the accuracy of the data, the Personal Data has been unlawfully processed and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead, or we no longer need the Personal Data, but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
Objection
: You may object to our processing of your Data if our processing is carried out based on our legitimate interests. Please note, however, that should we determine that our interests are so compelling as to override your objection we may continue to process your Personal Data.
Portability
: You may have the right to receive some of your Personal Data in machine readable format. This right extends to you being able to request that such data is sent to a third-party controller.
Withdrawing consent
: If the lawful basis we rely on to process your Personal Data is consent you have the right to withdraw this consent.
File a complaint
: You can also file a complaint with the data protection authorities of your place of residence.

To the extent any conflict may arise between the general terms of the International Notice above and any relevant provision of these Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms for the jurisdiction where you reside, or from which you access the Prodege Sites and Features and/or Services, will control.
Transfers Outside of Canada
Your personal information may be stored and/or processed outside of Canada (and outside of your province or territory in Canada, including outside of Quebec), including in the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. As a result, your personal information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and laws applicable in regions outside of where you reside.
Protection of Your Personal Data
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Personal Data and comply with applicable laws in Canada. Specifically, the Company has policies and practices to ensure the protection of your Personal Data. Depending on the volume and sensitivity of the data, the purposes for which it is used, and the format in which it is stored, we implement a combination of measures to protect your Personal Data, including:
Internal policies and procedures that define the roles and responsibilities of our employees throughout the life cycle of an item of information and limit their access to that information on a “need-to-know” basis;
Physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with relevant standards to protect personal information;
If the information is collected or stored electronically, technical safeguards such as encryption, firewalls, passwords, anti-virus software and similar measures;
A designated compliance team and Data Protection Officer to monitor the Company’s compliance with applicable privacy laws;
Employee training in privacy and information security; and
Procedures for receiving, investigating, and responding to complaints or inquiries about the Company’s information handling practices.
Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this International Notice and its Canada-specific section or your use of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, please contact our Data Protection Officer at

, or write to us via airmail to: Prodege, LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd. PMB 36227, West Hollywood, California, 90069-4109, USA; Attention: Data Protection Officer.
The lawful basis for our processing of your Personal Data will depend on the purposes of the processing. For most Personal Data processing activities covered by this International Notice, the lawful basis is that the processing is necessary for Prodege’s legitimate business interests. When we are required to share Personal data with law enforcement agencies or other governmental bodies, we do so on the basis that we are under a legal obligation to do so. We will also use consent as the legal basis where we deem appropriate or to the extent required by applicable law, for example, before we send you promotional emails or other communications.

” “our”
or
“us”

Pollfish, Poll Pay, Easy Bucks, Gopinion,
BitBurst, AdGate Media, Playtime Perks,

and others that may be added from time to time (collectively, the
“Prodege Sites”
). This Privacy Policy applies to the Prodege Sites and
to all of the features, websites, mobile applications, Internet browser extensions, emails, online services and other functionalities (collectively, the
“Features”
) available via or related to the Prodege Sites, whether accessed via a computer, mobile device, or other devices you use (each a "
Device
" and collectively, “
Devices
”), or otherwise (collectively, the
“Prodege Sites and Features”
), and the services available on or through the Prodege Sites and Features, including our emails and other electronic communications (collectively,
“our Services”
). Unless specifically stated, such as in the
U.S. State Privacy Notice
section, this Privacy Policy only covers information we collect through Prodege Sites and Features and our Services and does not cover any information we receive or collect offline or that is collected by any unrelated websites or companies to which we may provide links. Please contact us with any questions regarding this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices as instructed in Section 20 (
Contact Us
) of this Privacy Policy below.
When you visit any Prodege Sites and Features or use any of our Services, you may disclose and/or we may automatically collect information that identifies you personally. In this Privacy Policy,
“Personal Information”
(or “
PI
”) refers to any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or locate you, including information or data defined as personal information or personal data under applicable state law. Examples of PI may include, without limitation, your name, your precise geo-location, your credit card number, your email address, your mailing address, and your telephone number. We also collect, and may create from PI, information about you that is not PI (“
Non-PI
”). If we combine PI collected via Prodege Sites and Features or our Services with other of your PI or with Non-PI, that combined data will be treated as PI subject to this Privacy Policy.
PI and Non-PI may be collected on, through, or in connection with any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services.  For example, we may collect PI and/or Non-PI when you create or register for an account with us, fill out surveys, join a mailing list, upload receipts, correspond with us, enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, choose to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like, or otherwise volunteer or provide information about yourself.  You may also choose to install and use optional Internet browser extensions, add-ons, or similar plug-in software and technologies (each an "
Extension
" and collectively, “
Extensions
”) which may collect and use your information in a variety of ways. For example, the Swagbucks SwagButton, MyPoints Score!, Tada Extension, InboxDollars Billy Button, Upromise Extension, ySense Addon, and similar software or technologies we may offer from time to time are Extensions that allow you to shop directly with our merchant partners and qualify for rewards. The Extensions also provide other features and access to Offers (defined below), and allow you to monitor your earnings, customize your account information or experience, and other activities. If you install an Extension, we will automatically track certain websites you visit to allow us to provide the aforementioned features and to correlate your browser history, merchant visits, and Prodege Sites and Features engagements to provide better Services and Offers to you. In addition, Tracking Technologies (defined below) may be placed on your Devices when you install and use Extensions or when you click on an affiliate or Ad Network (defined below) link within a shopping-rewards feature. Your browsing activity on our merchant partners’ websites and other websites you visit may be tracked by cookies, Extensions, or other Prodege Sites and Features having such tracking capabilities. We may also use GPS or similar geo-location technology to determine the geo-coordinates of where you or your Device are located. In addition, our mobile applications may collect, among other things, certain information automatically, including, but not limited to the type of mobile Device you use, your mobile Device’s unique device identifier (“
UDID
”), the IP address of your mobile Device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the mobile application.
If you don’t provide us with or allow us to collect your PI, we generally will be unable to provide you with our Services and you may be unable to use the Prodege Sites and Features.
You may be able to limit data collection by changing the settings on your Device (but our services and features may lose functionality as a result), or as otherwise explained in the sections below.
We may also receive and supplement the information we directly collect from or about you with information from third parties, including Trusted Third Parties (defined below), and to the extent it is combined with PI collected via Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you are on a third-party website or service and you opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from Third Party Services to ensure that you properly receive any qualified Offers and for our other Data Purposes (defined below). We may also supplement and combine the PI we collect about you with outside records from third parties to enhance our ability to provide you with Offers and for our other Data Purposes, and to the extent it is combined with PI collected via Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
We use the PI and Non-PI we collect about you in order to: (i) provide you with our Services; (ii) operate and improve the Prodege Sites and Features; (iii) provide advertising, content, surveys, location-based deals, special offers, promotions, and other rewards opportunities (collectively, “
Offers
”); and (iv) for other marketing, administrative, operational, business, and commercial purposes subject to applicable law and not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or other notice by us at collection (collectively, our
“Data Purposes
”). We may use and disclose Non-PI for any purpose that is consistent with applicable law and this Privacy Policy, or any other notice by us at collection. Without limitation, your PI and Non-PI may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with unique identifiers (such as Prodege-assigned identifiers, UDIDs, etc.), and disclosed to (a) our parent companies, subsidiaries, sister companies, trusted agents and affiliated Services that we own and/or operate (“
Affiliates
”); and (b) our vendors, advertisers, merchants, survey partners, joint business ventures, and other trusted third parties (collectively, “
Trusted Third Parties
”) (some of whom may offer Third Party Services (defined below)), for purposes related to our business, including, without limitation, advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research, and our other Data Purposes as permitted by applicable law.
We may provide you with an opportunity to invite your friends, family, and acquaintances (“
Friends
”) to use our Services. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a Friend about any of our Services, you may provide us with your Friend’s name and email address. Through our referral service, you may have the ability to direct us to automatically send the Friend one or more emails or other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register for our Services (which invite may include additional subsequent reminders and communications). You must have your Friend’s consent to provide us with his or her information for this purpose and should not knowingly give us referral information for any person not permitted to use the Prodege Sites and Features, including, without limitation, a child under the age of 13, a person whose account has previously been suspended or deactivated, or a person who resides or is located in a territory where use of the Prodege Sites and Features is not authorized.
The Prodege Sites and Features may provide you the opportunity to participate in, make available, and/or post text (e.g., questions, comments, and suggestions), images, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, “
User Content
”) publicly through our blogs, chat rooms, forums, interactive features, public-facing member profile, third-party social networking services or other communication functionality (“
Community Features
”). Please note that certain information, such as your username, Service start date, earning preferences, qualified
rewards
, profile picture and other profile information we believe will help motivate you and others to participate in our program may be publicly displayed on the Prodege Sites and Features along with User Content. User Content may also contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to you, that we may also collect, disclose and use. Anything posted through Community Features is publicly available. This means that others will have access to that User Content and may use it or disclose it to third parties; this is beyond our control. If you choose to voluntarily disclose PI in the User Content and/or on the Community Features, that information will be considered publicly available information as well. The protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply to publicly available information. In addition, by posting through our Community Features, you are agreeing that we may use your User Content (and excerpts from your User Content) in connection with our Data Purposes.
The Prodege Sites and Features contain links to, or otherwise enable the opportunity to interact with (e.g., Facebook button) other websites and services provided by Trusted Third Parties (such as when you link to their site to take a survey or transact with them to qualify for rewards) that we do not own, operate or control (“
Third Party Services
”). In addition, because aspects of the Prodege Sites and Features include third-party Offers, Third Party Services may collect your information based on your interaction with those Offers, including via Tracking Technologies (defined and discussed below).  In addition, by interacting with Offers via Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, you authorize and direct us to disclose your PI and Non-PI to Third Party Services making Offers, and for them to disclose Offer-related activity data and other information to us. This helps us and them make and fulfill Offers, including making it easier for you to sign up for Offers, facilitating your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your identification, crediting you with any qualified rewards, and for our other Data Purposes.
Some Third Party Services set requirements to participate in Offers they sponsor on the Prodege Sites and Features. We collect and use PI and Non-PI about you, including responses to profile questions and other activity data, to determine if you qualify for these Offers. If you attempt such an Offer, we may use and disclose to
Third Party Services
: (a) your qualifications (e.g., profile data) and (b) your activity relating to the Offer itself (e.g., survey responses).  We do so at your direction, because this data is required for you to participate. If you want to avoid or limit this disclosure, you should stop participating and/or limit the information you provide us to qualify you. If you elect to participate and provide relevant qualification data, you direct us to disclose it to
Third Party Services
for purposes of qualifying you. You also authorize them to combine data about your Offer activity with any data used to qualify you.
Except as legally required for our vendors, the privacy and other practices of Third Party Services are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their privacy or other practices. We encourage our users to be aware of and to read the privacy statements, terms of service and similar disclosures and conditions of Third Party Services that collect PI or other data before visiting or otherwise interacting with those services.

Companies that host networks connecting advertisers with delivery platforms for digital advertising (collectively,
“Ad Networks”
), which are Third Party Services, may provide advertising based on your interests, as reflected in your use of Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, as well as your use of other websites and services. Some of these Ad Networks may place Tracking Technologies (defined below) on your Devices, allowing them to recognize you and/or your Device each time they send you, or you interact with, an online advertisement. Ads themselves may also include Tracking Technologies. In this way, Ad Networks may compile information about where you see advertisements online and determine which ads you click on, so, for instance, that we and they may provide you with Offers or advertisements believed to be of most interest to you, and to provide tracking, attribution and credit for advertisements that you choose to interact with. We are not the data controller for the Tracking Technologies that may be placed by these third parties on your Devices, nor do we have responsibility for these third parties’ privacy policies or information collection practices. You may limit or remove such Tracking Technologies through your Device settings; for more information, visit section 10(ii) (
What Are My Cookie Choices?
) below.
We use certain third-party analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and/or other technology providers to help us understand how you use Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, and these companies may set their own Tracking Technologies (defined below) on your Devices and receive access to or copies of the contents of your communications and interactions with our Sites and Features or our Services.
For example, we may use third-party services to record and review your interactions with the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, including mouse movements, clicks, page visits, keystrokes/key touches, and other details, including but not limited to any communications from you and any PI that you provide.  These “session replay” services help us organize and analyze your interaction data for our Data Purposes, including to improve and prevent fraud related to Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.
In addition, we may integrate third-party AI tools or services into aspects of our Sites and Features and our Services, including but not limited to our Customer Support process, where we use AI to review and enhance our support-related communications with you.
We may also use Google Analytics and similar third-party analytics providers to track visitors’ activity on our website. Google Analytics and similar third-party analytics providers may also use web browsing data and other data analysis to improve their own products. For more information on how to limit this activity, including to learn about the opt-out mechanism Google offers, visit section 10(ii) (
What Are My Cookie Choices?
) below. These and other Trusted Third Parties may collect information about you, including but not limited to your online activities over time and across different websites and services, when you use the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, or other online websites and services.
By using any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, you expressly consent to the recording and disclosing of your PI, the contents of your communications, your interactions, and other data to the parties described in this Section.
i.    Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We set and access, and third parties (including Trusted Third Parties) may set and access, cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, pixels (including the Meta Pixel), tags, software development kits (“SDKs”), session replay tools, and other tracking technologies (collectively, “
Tracking Technologies
”) on your Devices in connection with your use of Prodege Sites and Features or our Services. Such third parties (“
Cookie Operators
”) may collect information across various channels using Tracking Technologies for purposes of delivering more relevant Offers to you or other Data Purposes. We may use a variety of Tracking Technologies in connection with our Data Purposes. Tracking Technologies may automatically capture PI and other information, including, without
limitation, your IP Address, UDID, and browser or operating system type and version, contents of your communications, interactions, and may detect whether your Device or software has certain capabilities such as a microphone or webcam access. We and Third Party Services generally use Tracking Technologies and the information they generate to support the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services or Third Party Services, including, for instance: (i) by offering you surveys, shopping, and other targeted Offers; (ii) for identity verification; (iii) for analytics; (iv) to ensure compliance with our programs; and (v) to identify and honor your choices (such as opt-outs). Tracking Technologies may also be used as follows: (a) to provide you with convenience when you access the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services by remembering that you have visited us before and by remembering your username, password and other user information, and your preferences to help you avoid future re-entry of certain information; (b) to allow us and
Third Party Services
to understand or predict your interests so we and they can personalize your experience on Prodege Sites and Features or our Services and elsewhere online, across Devices, web browsers, email, mobile and other applications.   In doing so, we and Third Party Services may link the information collected from Tracking Technologies, and from other sources, with other of your PI and Non-PI, and we and they may track your web-browsing and other activity in order to provide you with Offers and for our or their other Data Purposes); (c) for analytical and statistical purposes, quality control, validation and verification purposes, and to improve the services we and
Third Party Services
offer; and (d)
Third Party Services
may link the information we disclose to them (or that they collect) to cookies stored on your browser or Devices, and they may collect information such as your IP address, UDID, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information.
Third Party Services
may use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example,
Third Party Services
may deliver an advertisement to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you because you visited a particular website. Our mobile applications may include Tracking Technologies that disclose your Device’s precise geo-location and other details about your Device (like hardware characteristics, a variety of sensor data, and a list and history of installed third-party applications) to
Third Party Services
who may use this information to generate Offers for you, for advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics, and research, and their or our other Data Purposes. See instructions to limit or disable such tracking
in section 10(ii) below; but be aware that limiting such tracking will affect some Device or mobile application functionality and may limit your ability to use our Services, complete Offers and earn rewards.
ii.    What Are My Cookie Choices?
Cookies may include a small data file which is stored on your systems. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookies, once you close your browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed or disabled by following your web browser help-file directions.
You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, and mobile Devices may offer ad and data limitation choices. Please note that when you use cookie control tools, you will have to change your settings for each browser and Device you use, and your limitation on cookies can limit the functionality of online services you use, including Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.

Safari
If you block cookies in this manner, Prodege Sites and Features and our Services (including the ability to complete Offers and earn rewards), may not operate as intended.
One use of cookies is interest-based advertising, which uses your activity information to help provide you with more relevant Offers. To learn more about internet-based advertising in general, and exercise certain opt-outs that some companies provide, which may include use of geo-location, cross-device data-directed, and/or “audience matched advertising” ads, please visit the following ad industry self-regulatory resources:

.
We are not responsible for the completeness, accuracy or effectiveness of any third-party cookie-choice programs or tools. If you exercise these choice controls they may need to be compiled on each browser and Device you use, and if they use a cookie to signal your opt-out, your choice may no longer be recognizable if you later clear or block cookies. Not accepting cookies (or opting out of cookies), installing ad blocking technologies, and/or disabling analytics providers may make certain features of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services unavailable to you and may affect our ability to validate whether or not you qualified for a reward by successfully completing an Offer.
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a user’s browser.

We may offer a service enabling you to enroll a qualifying payment card in order to earn rewards or benefits when you make qualifying transactions with participating merchants (a “
CLO Program
”). Your participation in a CLO Program is further governed by our
Card Linked Offer Service Terms
. If you participate in a CLO Program and provide your payment information for that purpose, we and Third Party Services (including, without limitation, Braintree Payments (a division of PayPal, Inc.), Visa, Inc., Rewards Network, and Figg, Inc.) will have the right to use and disclose the transaction information generated in such CLO Program (“
CLO Transaction Data
”) for the purposes of operating and improving the CLO Program, including, without limitation: (a) to confirm whether you qualify for an Offer; (b) to confirm whether a specific transaction occurred or rewards were earned (for example, the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase if there is a missing or disputed transaction); (c)  to allow participating merchants and others to assess the results of their campaign and analyze ways to improve or optimize a CLO Program and its Offers; (d) to create a record of the CLO Transaction Data and thereafter maintain and use such CLO Transaction Data in connection with operating the CLO Program; and (e) to provide information in response to a request from a government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you, a merchant, another relevant Trusted Third Party, or others.
By participating in a CLO Program, you authorize and direct the disclosure, exchange, and use of CLO Transaction Data described above and herein by and among us and Third Party Services, applicable payment card networks, and participating merchants
. Please visit the Card Linked Offer Service Terms to learn more about the data collection, use, and disclosure practices related to the CLO Program. If you would like to opt out of card linking and CLO Transaction Data collection in connection with a CLO Program, please visit the card linking section of the applicable Service and remove any payment cards that you no longer wish to be associated with the CLO Program.
Certain functionality on Prodege Sites and Features or our Services may permit interactions that you initiate between our Services and third-party social media services (
“Social Media Services”
) such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter (“
Social Features
”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to “like” or “share” content from our Services with Social Media Services; to log-in to our Services using your username and password for Social Media Services; to transmit content to or from our Services to or from your account on Social Media Services; and to otherwise connect our Services to Social Media Services. Enabling or interacting with Social Features may also set one or more cookies or other Tracking Technologies on your Devices. Please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of such Social Media Services offering such Social Features. If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to may be disclosed to and publicly displayed on our Services or on such Social Media Services. Similarly, if you post information on a Social Media Service that references any of our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with any of our Services in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the Prodege Sites and Features in accordance with the terms of the Social Media Services and our
Terms of Use
. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a Social Media Service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your connections’ web pages, profile pages, groups you or they belong to, or similar pages on such Social Media Service.
The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected by any Social Media Service via Social Features remains subject to their privacy practices, including whether they continue to disclose information to us, the types of information disclosed, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on such Social Media Service.
In addition to the other types of data disclosures described throughout this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose your PI and Non-PI as described in this section. We may disclose your PI and Non-PI when required by law, or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial or administrative proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on us. We may also disclose your PI and Non-PI upon request to governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or if we in our sole discretion believe there to be a credible situation that requires us to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy for any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services. We may also use IP addresses, UDID or other Device, activity or session identifiers to identify users, and we reserve the right (in our sole discretion) to do so in cooperation with Third Party Services, as well as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies, without notice to you. We may disclose your PI to Third Party Services in connection with their performance of services to, or on behalf of, the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services (and vice versa) and for our Data Purposes. In addition, if you use our mobile applications, we may disclose your current geo-location to Third Party Services so that we or they may provide you with Offers based on your location, for our Data Purposes, and for advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research. Please see section 15 (
Updating Your Information, Choice and Opt-Out

We may disclose or sell aggregate or individualized information about you that may include, without limitation: (1) your PI and related information; (2) your use of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services; (3) Third Party Services and other websites you visit; and (4) your geo-location and information derived therefrom.

“Business Transactions”
).

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time via updates. If we decide to make an update with material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of the update by sending you an administrative email and/or posting links to the updated Privacy Policy in places on the Prodege Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of what PI and other information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it may be disclosed to others. Your continued use of any of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services after delivery of the administrative email to you, or after the update links are posted, constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy as to any continued use of the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, including our future use of PI or other information previously or thereafter collected in accordance with the updated Privacy Policy.

The Prodege Sites and Features and our Services are for general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information (as defined by the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
”)) from children younger than the age of 13. If you are under the age of majority (18 in most states and provinces), you should use the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services only with the permission and guidance of your parent or guardian. If you are under 13, you should not use our Service. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child younger than 13, we will take actions as required by COPPA.

Additional Notices for Residents of Certain States

We maintain security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the PI and other information under our control. Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other technologies and communication channels are, by their nature, not entirely secure, and your PI and Non-PI may therefore be subject to interception or loss which is beyond our reasonable control. While we strive to protect your PI and Non-PI, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any PI or Non-PI you transmit to us or that we otherwise collect, and any transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, as permitted by applicable law, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your PI or Non-PI due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
Although we generally maintain our user data in the United States, it is possible that some of the data processing may occur outside of the United States, carried out by companies or individuals under contract with us. While the data protection laws of these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect your PI in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, you consent to this transfer of your PI and Non-PI to any server used by Prodege or its vendors from time to time.
If you are not a resident of the United States, please consult the international version of our Privacy Policy
here
and be aware that data protection laws in the United States (as well as the legal procedures for courts, governmental authorities, and parties in civil litigation to obtain access to our user data) may differ substantially from the laws and procedures in your country of residence. In addition, if you submit your PI to us, you are consenting to the processing, storage, use and transfer of that PI within the United States as provided in this Privacy Policy.
The interpretation and application of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Except as otherwise expressly provided in our
Terms of Use
, your use of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States and the State of California.

U.S. State Privacy Laws
”).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Notice shall have the meanings given to them under the relevant U.S. State Privacy Laws or (if applicable) in other sections of our Privacy Policy.
Applicability
:
Section A of this Notice provides notice of our data practices, including our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of Consumers’ personal information or personal data under relevant U.S. State Privacy Laws (collectively, “
PI
”).
Sections B-F of this Notice provide information regarding Consumer rights under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws and how you may exercise them.

Non-Applicability, Human Resources:
This
Notice does not apply to
our job applicants, current or former employees, or independent contractors (“
Personnel
”) in connection with their PI collected in connection with such relationship with the Company; however, our California Personnel may obtain a separate privacy notice that applies to them by contacting our Human Resources department at hr@prodege.com.
The description of our data practices in this Notice covers the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date and will be updated at least annually. Our data practices may differ between updates to this Notice; however, if materially different from this Notice, we will provide supplemental pre-collection notice of the current practices, which may include references to other privacy policies, notices, or statements. Otherwise, this Notice serves as our notice at collection.
We may receive or collect your PI directly from you or from your Devices, from Third Party Services, or from other individuals and businesses, as well as public sources of data.
Generally, we process your PI to provide you our Services and as otherwise related to the operation of our business, including for one or more of the following Business Purposes: Performing Services; Managing Interactions and Transactions; Security; Debugging; Providing Advertising & Marketing Services; Quality Assurance; Processing Interactions and Transactions; and Research and Development. We may also use PI for other Business Purposes in a context that is not a Sale or Share under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, such as disclosing it to our Service Providers, Contractors, or Processors that perform services for us (“
Vendors
”), to you, or to other parties at your direction or through your action
(e.g., if you participate in Offers that require qualification, you direct us to process and disclose your profile information to the Offer sponsor to determine if you qualify for the Offer; and any Third Party Services that you interact with in response to such Offers will receive both the profile and other activity data)
; for the additional purposes explained at the time of collection (such as in the applicable privacy policy or notice); as required or permitted by applicable law; to the government or private parties to comply with law or legal process; and in Business Transactions (collectively, “
Additional Business Purposes
”). Subject to restrictions and obligations under U.S. State Privacy Laws, our Vendors may also use your PI for Business Purposes and Additional Business Purposes and may engage their own vendors to enable them to perform services for us.
We may also use and disclose your PI under this Notice for Commercial Purposes, which may be considered a “Sale” or “Share” under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, such as when Trusted Third Parties
collect your PI via third-party cookies,
and when we process PI for certain advertising purposes. In addition, we may make your PI available to third parties for their own use via third-party cookies or otherwise.
As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified or aggregate consumer information, and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI. We have no obligation to re-identify information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests. Data exempt from U.S. State Privacy Laws are not included in this Notice.
We provide more detail on our data practices in the two charts that follow.

When deciding how long to keep your PI, we consider (among other things) whether we have an active relationship with you, whether we need to retain the PI to provide you our Services, whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any contracts or laws that require us to maintain certain data for a certain period of time), our Data Purposes, our Business Purposes and Additional Business Purposes. Rather than delete your PI, we might deidentify it by removing identifying details so it is no longer considered PI, in which event we will not attempt to re-identify that data.
There may be additional information we collect that meets the definition of PI under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws but is not reflected by a category above, in which case we will treat it as PI as required but will not include it when we describe our practices by PI category.

We provide Consumers the privacy rights described in this section pursuant to the requirements of their applicable U.S. State Privacy Law
as of the effective date of each such law, provided any such request meets the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below). For residents of states without applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, we may consider requests under this section but will apply our discretion in whether and how we process them. We may also apply state law rights in states with U.S. State Privacy Laws prior to the effective date of such laws in our discretion. At this time, in an exercise of our discretion, we will accept and process Right to Delete requests (as defined below) from all consumers.
To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page
here
or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd, PMB 36227, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (via phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.).  More details on the request and verification process are provided in Section C (
How We Process Your Consumer Privacy Requests
) below.  The Consumer rights we accommodate are as follows:
i.    Right to Limit Sensitive PI Processing
With regard to PI that qualifies as Sensitive PI under U.S. State Privacy Laws, if you elect to provide us with that Sensitive PI, you will have consented to our collection and processing of it. You may submit a request to limit certain processing of your Sensitive PI
here
. However, under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, your request will not affect the following permitted processing purposes, or any other purposes permitted by law:
To perform our Services at your request or at your direction;
To prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents, fraudulent activity, illegal actions, etc.;
For short term transient use, including, but not limited to, non-personalized advertising as part of your interaction with our Services; and
To maintain or service accounts, provide customer service, process or fulfill Offers, orders and transactions, verify customer information, process payments, or provide similar services.
ii.    Right to Know/Access
Consumers have the right under U.S. State Privacy Laws to request access to PI maintained by the Company. This right may be limited in some circumstances by law.
a)    Categories
California residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the period that is 12-months prior to the request date:
The categories of PI we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.
The Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes for our collecting or Selling your PI.
The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.
A list of the categories of your PI disclosed for a Business Purpose and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred.
A list of the categories of your PI sold and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale occurred.
Residents of Delaware and Oregon can request additional information regarding certain third party disclosures of your PI (e.g., excluding disclosures to our service providers and processors).
Consumers of other states subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws have the right to confirm if we are processing your PI, which we will treat as a Categories request.
b)    Specific Pieces (Transportable Copies)
You may request to obtain a transportable copy of your PI that we have collected and are maintaining, as required by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws.  If you wish to receive specific pieces of your PI, we will attempt to honor requests for specific pieces of your PI where reasonably possible.  We have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep PI longer than we normally retain it or longer than we are required to under applicable law to comply with access requests.
iii.    Do Not Sell / Share / Target for Advertising
Various U.S. State Privacy Laws have broad and differing concepts of “Selling” PI for which an opt-out is required, with some states including PI transfers for non-monetary consideration and other states only including PI transfers for monetary consideration. California also has an opt-out from “Sharing” for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising purposes (use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements across websites or apps). Other states have an opt-out of “Targeted Advertising” (defined differently, but also addressing tracking, profiling, and targeting of advertisements). We may Sell or Share your PI and/or use your PI for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S. State Privacy Laws. However, we provide you with an opt-out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting that is intended to combine all of these various state opt-outs into a single opt-out available regardless of which U.S. State Privacy Law is applicable to your PI
.
Ad Networks and other Trusted Third Parties may associate cookies and other Tracking Technologies that collect PI about you on Prodege Sites and Features or in connection with our Services, or otherwise collect and process PI that we make available about you. We understand that making your PI available on Prodege Sites and Features or in connection with our Services, or otherwise, to Trusted Third Parties could be deemed a Sale and/or Share under some U.S. State Privacy Laws and thus we will treat such PI (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other digital activity information) collected by Trusted Third Parties that are not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor), as a Sale and/or Share and subject to your right to make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request. We will not Sell your PI, Share your PI for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising, or process your PI for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request as follows:
Opt-out for non-cookie PI
: If you want to limit our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address or web browsing activity) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you may make an opt-out request
here
.
Opt-out for cookie PI
: If you want to limit our processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you may exercise an opt-out request by following the instructions on
our Consumer Rights Request page
here
,
or by
clicking the link to update
Your Cookie Choices
. This cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your Device. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies on your Device, your preferences may no longer be effective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.
Opt-out preference signals ("OOPS"), as they are known in California; also known as global privacy control (or GPC): Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process OOPS or GPC signals, which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual's choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of PI. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download a compatible internet browser or a plugin for on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable to OOPS/GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process OOPS/GPC signals on our website, as explained by our consent management platform
here
. We process OOPS/GPC signals with respect to any Sales and Sharing of PI with Trusted Third Parties that may occur via cookies or other Tracking Technologies, as discussed above and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC, although it may affect our ability to accurately track your activities for crediting your account with qualified rewards; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC, except for indicating whether we recognize the signal.
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale or Share: (i) if you direct us to disclose PI; (ii) to comply with a Consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Company as defined above, or as part of a Business Transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
iv.    Right to Delete
Except to the extent we have retention rights under applicable law, you may request that we delete your PI. Our retention rights include, without limitation:
To complete transactions and services that you have requested;
For security purposes;
For legitimate internal Business Purposes (e.g., maintaining business records);
To comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement; and
To exercise or defend legal claims.
Please also be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of PI or content you may have posted.
Under certain U.S. State Privacy Laws, your deletion right may apply only to PI that we collected directly from you.
v.    Right to Correct
Consumers in certain states may bring inaccuracies they find in their PI that we maintain to our attention, and we will act upon such a report as required by applicable law.
You can also make changes to your PI in your online account in the account settings section of the account. That will not, however, necessarily change your PI in other places where we may maintain it.
To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page
here
or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd, PMB 36227, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. In addition, you may email
privacyrequest@prodege.com
and we will respond with the appropriate web submission form for you to use for the submission of your request. To submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Targeting Request for cookie-related PI or the right to limit Sensitive PI processing, click
here
. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (via phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.).
i.    Your Request Must be a Verifiable Consumer Request
As permitted or required by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, any request you submit to us must be a
Verifiable Consumer Request
, meaning that when you make a request, we may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, e-mail, telephone number and/or account information. We will review the information provided and may request additional information (e.g., transaction history) to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual. We may not fulfill your Right to Know/Access, Right to Delete, or Right to Correct request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.  We do not verify requests to Opt-out of Sell/Share/Target or Limit Sensitive PI unless we suspect fraud.
You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request, but you may use your password-protected account to do so. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from the password-protected account, we may decline a request or request that you provide further verifying information.
We verify each request as follows:
Right to Know/Access (Categories)
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Know/Access Categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. If we cannot do so, we will refer you to this Notice for a general description of our data practices.
Right to Know/Access (Specific Pieces)
: If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request To Know/Access Specific Pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the Consumer whose PI is the subject of the request. If you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know Categories Request if you are a California resident.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target & Limit Sensitive PI
:  No specific verification required unless we suspect fraud.
Right to Delete
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we may verify your Request to Delete to either (i) a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or (ii) a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion.  If we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion request, you can still make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target and/or Limit Sensitive PI request.
Right to Correct
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Correct to either (i) a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or (ii) a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized correction.
To protect Consumers, if we are unable to verify you sufficiently, we will be unable to honor your request. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
ii.    Agent Requests
Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of Consumers, depending on the Consumer’s state of residency, but we reserve the right to also verify the Consumer’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request through our Consumer Rights Request page
here
and indicating in the open text field that they are submitting the request as an agent. We will require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of the Consumer by providing evidence sufficient to verify the agent’s identity and authority to act on behalf of the Consumer. For example, if you are California Consumer, we may require evidence of the agent’s identity, proof of registration with the California Secretary of State (if the agent is a business), and at least one of the following evidencing proof of the agent’s legal authority to act on behalf of the individual Consumer: (i) a Power of Attorney granted under the Probate Code that we can reasonably verify; or (ii) signed, written permission by the Consumer. We apply similar verification standards for agent requests received on behalf of Consumers in other states where agent requests are permissible.
We may also require the Consumer to verify their own identity directly with us and to directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
In addition, residents of certain states may use an agent to make an opt-out request subject to reasonable verification of agent authority and consumer identity.
In the absence of any of the general conditions detailed above, we are entitled to reject any request submitted through an agent. In addition, the agent is subject to the verification standards applicable to the type of request(s) made.
iii.    Appeals
Consumers may appeal our decision regarding a request by contacting us at
privacyappeals@prodege.com
with the following subject line: "CRR Appeals Request".
iv.    Our Responses
Some PI that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a Consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that PI in response to those requests.  If we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we process to respond to your Consumer request(s).  In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest.  We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.   We may also refuse to act upon a request that is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
Consistent with applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your Social Security number, driver’s license number, or other government-issued ID number, financial account number, an account password, or security questions or answers, in response to a Consumer privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.
We will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws for your exercise of your Consumer privacy rights. We may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.
We may offer rewards or other benefits (“
Incentives
”) from time-to-time to Consumers that provide us with PI, such as name, telephone number, e-mail address, IP address, or geo-location. You may opt-in to Incentives by subscribing to Incentive programs we may offer from time-to-time. If you subsequently wish to withdraw from such programs, the method for doing so will be explained in the program Terms of Use, and you may do so at any time.
For more information, including valuation notice, see our Notice of Financial Incentives
here
.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may limit or affect your rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws. In addition, we are not required to honor your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or another person’s rights or conflict with applicable law.
This Notice provides additional information on our online practices and the rights of residents of certain states related to Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.
i.    California Minors Erasure
If you are a California resident under eighteen (18) years of age who has posted content or information on Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, you can request removal by contacting us at the mailing address set forth in the
Contact Us
section above detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it.  We will then make reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so you cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and other means that we do not control.
ii.    Shine the Light—California Residents
We also provide California residents with the option to opt-out of the disclosure of “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, with third parties (other than with Company affiliates) for such third parties own direct marketing purposes. California residents may exercise this opt-out, request information about our Shine the Light law compliance, and/or obtain a disclosure of third parties we have disclosed information to and the categories of information disclosed. California residents may make such a request, or inquire further about our compliance with this law, by emailing privacyrequest@prodege.com or mailing us at the address set forth in the
Contact Us
section above. You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is different than, and in addition to, CCPA rights, and must be requested separately. We are only required to respond to one request per person each year. We are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mailing address (requests by phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.). We are not responsible for requests that are incomplete or not labeled and sent properly.
iii.    Affirmative Opt-In for Sale or Sharing, or use for Targeted Advertising, of PI of “Child” Residents of Certain States
We do not knowingly Sell or Share, or use for Targeted Advertising, the PI of Consumers who meet the definition of a “child” (or other similar term) under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, unless we receive affirmative opt-in authorization from (i) the Consumer, if that person is at least 13 years of age and Consumer consent is required under the applicable law, or (ii) the parent or guardian of the Consumer, if the Consumer is less than 13 years of age. If you think we may have unknowingly Sold or Shared PI, or used PI for Targeted Advertising, of a Consumer under the threshold age (as set by the applicable U.S. State Privacy Law) without the appropriate affirmative opt-in authorization, please report that to us as described in the
Contact Us
section above.

CCPA

U.S. State Privacy Law
” and collectively, “
U.S. State Privacy Laws
”).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Notice shall have the meanings given to them under the relevant U.S. State Privacy Laws or (if applicable) in other sections of our Privacy Policy.
Applicability
:
Section A of this Notice provides notice of our data practices, including our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of Consumers’ personal information or personal data under relevant U.S. State Privacy Laws (collectively, “
PI
”).
Sections B-F of this Notice provide information regarding Consumer rights under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws and how you may exercise them.
Section G of this Notice provides additional information for residents of certain states only.
Non-Applicability, Human Resources:
This
Notice does not apply to
our job applicants, current or former employees, or independent contractors (“
Personnel
”) in connection with their PI collected in connection with such relationship with the Company; however, our California Personnel may obtain a separate privacy notice that applies to them by contacting our Human Resources department at hr@prodege.com.
The description of our data practices in this Notice covers the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date and will be updated at least annually. Our data practices may differ between updates to this Notice; however, if materially different from this Notice, we will provide supplemental pre-collection notice of the current practices, which may include references to other privacy policies, notices, or statements. Otherwise, this Notice serves as our notice at collection.
We may receive or collect your PI directly from you or from your Devices, from Third Party Services, or from other individuals and businesses, as well as public sources of data.
Generally, we process your PI to provide you our Services and as otherwise related to the operation of our business, including for one or more of the following Business Purposes: Performing Services; Managing Interactions and Transactions; Security; Debugging; Providing Advertising & Marketing Services; Quality Assurance; Processing Interactions and Transactions; and Research and Development. We may also use PI for other Business Purposes in a context that is not a Sale or Share under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, such as disclosing it to our Service Providers, Contractors, or Processors that perform services for us (“
Vendors
”), to you, or to other parties at your direction or through your action
(e.g., if you participate in Offers that require qualification, you direct us to process and disclose your profile information to the Offer sponsor to determine if you qualify for the Offer; and any Third Party Services that you interact with in response to such Offers will receive both the profile and other activity data)
; for the additional purposes explained at the time of collection (such as in the applicable privacy policy or notice); as required or permitted by applicable law; to the government or private parties to comply with law or legal process; and in Business Transactions (collectively, “
Additional Business Purposes
”). Subject to restrictions and obligations under U.S. State Privacy Laws, our Vendors may also use your PI for Business Purposes and Additional Business Purposes and may engage their own vendors to enable them to perform services for us.
We may also use and disclose your PI under this Notice for Commercial Purposes, which may be considered a “Sale” or “Share” under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, such as when Trusted Third Parties
collect your PI via third-party cookies,
and when we process PI for certain advertising purposes. In addition, we may make your PI available to third parties for their own use via third-party cookies or otherwise.
As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified or aggregate consumer information, and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI. We have no obligation to re-identify information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests. Data exempt from U.S. State Privacy Laws are not included in this Notice.
We provide more detail on our data practices in the two charts that follow.

When deciding how long to keep your PI, we consider (among other things) whether we have an active relationship with you, whether we need to retain the PI to provide you our Services, whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any contracts or laws that require us to maintain certain data for a certain period of time), our Data Purposes, our Business Purposes and Additional Business Purposes. Rather than delete your PI, we might deidentify it by removing identifying details so it is no longer considered PI, in which event we will not attempt to re-identify that data.
There may be additional information we collect that meets the definition of PI under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws but is not reflected by a category above, in which case we will treat it as PI as required but will not include it when we describe our practices by PI category.

We provide Consumers the privacy rights described in this section pursuant to the requirements of their applicable U.S. State Privacy Law
as of the effective date of each such law, provided any such request meets the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below). For residents of states without applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, we may consider requests under this section but will apply our discretion in whether and how we process them. We may also apply state law rights in states with U.S. State Privacy Laws prior to the effective date of such laws in our discretion. At this time, in an exercise of our discretion, we will accept and process Right to Delete requests (as defined below) from all consumers.
To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page
here
or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd, PMB 36227, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (via phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.).  More details on the request and verification process are provided in Section C (
How We Process Your Consumer Privacy Requests
) below.  The Consumer rights we accommodate are as follows:
i.    Right to Limit Sensitive PI Processing
With regard to PI that qualifies as Sensitive PI under U.S. State Privacy Laws, if you elect to provide us with that Sensitive PI, you will have consented to our collection and processing of it. You may submit a request to limit certain processing of your Sensitive PI
here
. However, under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, your request will not affect the following permitted processing purposes, or any other purposes permitted by law:
To perform our Services at your request or at your direction;
To prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents, fraudulent activity, illegal actions, etc.;
For short term transient use, including, but not limited to, non-personalized advertising as part of your interaction with our Services; and
To maintain or service accounts, provide customer service, process or fulfill Offers, orders and transactions, verify customer information, process payments, or provide similar services.
ii.    Right to Know/Access
Consumers have the right under U.S. State Privacy Laws to request access to PI maintained by the Company. This right may be limited in some circumstances by law.
a)    Categories
California residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the period that is 12-months prior to the request date:
The categories of PI we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.
The Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes for our collecting or Selling your PI.
The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.
A list of the categories of your PI disclosed for a Business Purpose and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred.
A list of the categories of your PI sold and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale occurred.
Residents of Delaware and Oregon can request additional information regarding certain third party disclosures of your PI (e.g., excluding disclosures to our service providers and processors).
Consumers of other states subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws have the right to confirm if we are processing your PI, which we will treat as a Categories request.
b)    Specific Pieces (Transportable Copies)
You may request to obtain a transportable copy of your PI that we have collected and are maintaining, as required by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws.  If you wish to receive specific pieces of your PI, we will attempt to honor requests for specific pieces of your PI where reasonably possible.  We have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep PI longer than we normally retain it or longer than we are required to under applicable law to comply with access requests.
iii.    Do Not Sell / Share / Target for Advertising
Various U.S. State Privacy Laws have broad and differing concepts of “Selling” PI for which an opt-out is required, with some states including PI transfers for non-monetary consideration and other states only including PI transfers for monetary consideration. California also has an opt-out from “Sharing” for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising purposes (use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements across websites or apps). Other states have an opt-out of “Targeted Advertising” (defined differently, but also addressing tracking, profiling, and targeting of advertisements). We may Sell or Share your PI and/or use your PI for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S. State Privacy Laws. However, we provide you with an opt-out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting that is intended to combine all of these various state opt-outs into a single opt-out available regardless of which U.S. State Privacy Law is applicable to your PI
.
Ad Networks and other Trusted Third Parties may associate cookies and other Tracking Technologies that collect PI about you on Prodege Sites and Features or in connection with our Services, or otherwise collect and process PI that we make available about you. We understand that making your PI available on Prodege Sites and Features or in connection with our Services, or otherwise, to Trusted Third Parties could be deemed a Sale and/or Share under some U.S. State Privacy Laws and thus we will treat such PI (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other digital activity information) collected by Trusted Third Parties that are not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor), as a Sale and/or Share and subject to your right to make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request. We will not Sell your PI, Share your PI for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising, or process your PI for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request as follows:
Opt-out for non-cookie PI
: If you want to limit our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address or web browsing activity) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you may make an opt-out request
here
.
Opt-out for cookie PI
: If you want to limit our processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you may exercise an opt-out request by following the instructions on
our Consumer Rights Request page
here
,
or by
clicking the link to update
Your Cookie Choices
. This cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your Device. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies on your Device, your preferences may no longer be effective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.
Opt-out preference signals ("OOPS"), as they are known in California; also known as global privacy control (or GPC): Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process OOPS or GPC signals, which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual's choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of PI. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download a compatible internet browser or a plugin for on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable to OOPS/GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process OOPS/GPC signals on our website, as explained by our consent management platform
here
. We process OOPS/GPC signals with respect to any Sales and Sharing of PI with Trusted Third Parties that may occur via cookies or other Tracking Technologies, as discussed above and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC, although it may affect our ability to accurately track your activities for crediting your account with qualified rewards; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC, except for indicating whether we recognize the signal.
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale or Share: (i) if you direct us to disclose PI; (ii) to comply with a Consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Company as defined above, or as part of a Business Transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.
iv.    Right to Delete
Except to the extent we have retention rights under applicable law, you may request that we delete your PI. Our retention rights include, without limitation:
To complete transactions and services that you have requested;
For security purposes;
For legitimate internal Business Purposes (e.g., maintaining business records);
To comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement; and
To exercise or defend legal claims.
Please also be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of PI or content you may have posted.
Under certain U.S. State Privacy Laws, your deletion right may apply only to PI that we collected directly from you.
v.    Right to Correct
Consumers in certain states may bring inaccuracies they find in their PI that we maintain to our attention, and we will act upon such a report as required by applicable law.
You can also make changes to your PI in your online account in the account settings section of the account. That will not, however, necessarily change your PI in other places where we may maintain it.
To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page
here
or mail your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd, PMB 36227, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109, Attention: Privacy, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. In addition, you may email
privacyrequest@prodege.com
and we will respond with the appropriate web submission form for you to use for the submission of your request. To submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Targeting Request for cookie-related PI or the right to limit Sensitive PI processing, click

. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (via phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.).
i.    Your Request Must be a Verifiable Consumer Request
As permitted or required by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, any request you submit to us must be a
Verifiable Consumer Request
, meaning that when you make a request, we may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, e-mail, telephone number and/or account information. We will review the information provided and may request additional information (e.g., transaction history) to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual. We may not fulfill your Right to Know/Access, Right to Delete, or Right to Correct request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.  We do not verify requests to Opt-out of Sell/Share/Target or Limit Sensitive PI unless we suspect fraud.
You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request, but you may use your password-protected account to do so. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from the password-protected account, we may decline a request or request that you provide further verifying information.
We verify each request as follows:
Right to Know/Access (Categories)
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Know/Access Categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. If we cannot do so, we will refer you to this Notice for a general description of our data practices.
Right to Know/Access (Specific Pieces)
: If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request To Know/Access Specific Pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the Consumer whose PI is the subject of the request. If you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know Categories Request if you are a California resident.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target & Limit Sensitive PI
:  No specific verification required unless we suspect fraud.
Right to Delete
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we may verify your Request to Delete to either (i) a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or (ii) a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion.  If we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion request, you can still make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target and/or Limit Sensitive PI request.
Right to Correct
:  If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Correct to either (i) a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or (ii) a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized correction.
To protect Consumers, if we are unable to verify you sufficiently, we will be unable to honor your request. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
ii.    Agent Requests
Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of Consumers, depending on the Consumer’s state of residency, but we reserve the right to also verify the Consumer’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us by submitting a request through our Consumer Rights Request page
here
and indicating in the open text field that they are submitting the request as an agent. We will require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of the Consumer by providing evidence sufficient to verify the agent’s identity and authority to act on behalf of the Consumer. For example, if you are California Consumer, we may require evidence of the agent’s identity, proof of registration with the California Secretary of State (if the agent is a business), and at least one of the following evidencing proof of the agent’s legal authority to act on behalf of the individual Consumer: (i) a Power of Attorney granted under the Probate Code that we can reasonably verify; or (ii) signed, written permission by the Consumer. We apply similar verification standards for agent requests received on behalf of Consumers in other states where agent requests are permissible.
We may also require the Consumer to verify their own identity directly with us and to directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
In addition, residents of certain states may use an agent to make an opt-out request subject to reasonable verification of agent authority and consumer identity.
In the absence of any of the general conditions detailed above, we are entitled to reject any request submitted through an agent. In addition, the agent is subject to the verification standards applicable to the type of request(s) made.
iii.    Appeals
Consumers may appeal our decision regarding a request by contacting us at
privacyappeals@prodege.com
with the following subject line: "CRR Appeals Request".
iv.    Our Responses
Some PI that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a Consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that PI in response to those requests.  If we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we process to respond to your Consumer request(s).  In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest.  We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.   We may also refuse to act upon a request that is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
Consistent with applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your Social Security number, driver’s license number, or other government-issued ID number, financial account number, an account password, or security questions or answers, in response to a Consumer privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.
We will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws for your exercise of your Consumer privacy rights. We may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.
We may offer rewards or other benefits (“
Incentives
”) from time-to-time to Consumers that provide us with PI, such as name, telephone number, e-mail address, IP address, or geo-location. You may opt-in to Incentives by subscribing to Incentive programs we may offer from time-to-time. If you subsequently wish to withdraw from such programs, the method for doing so will be explained in the program Terms of Use, and you may do so at any time.
For more information, including valuation notice, see our Notice of Financial Incentives
here
.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may limit or affect your rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws. In addition, we are not required to honor your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or another person’s rights or conflict with applicable law.
This Notice provides additional information on our online practices and the rights of residents of certain states related to Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.
i.    California Minors Erasure
If you are a California resident under eighteen (18) years of age who has posted content or information on Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, you can request removal by contacting us at the mailing address set forth in the
Contact Us
section above detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it.  We will then make reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so you cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and other means that we do not control.
ii.    Shine the Light—California Residents
We also provide California residents with the option to opt-out of the disclosure of “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, with third parties (other than with Company affiliates) for such third parties own direct marketing purposes. California residents may exercise this opt-out, request information about our Shine the Light law compliance, and/or obtain a disclosure of third parties we have disclosed information to and the categories of information disclosed. California residents may make such a request, or inquire further about our compliance with this law, by emailing privacyrequest@prodege.com or mailing us at the address set forth in the
Contact Us
section above. You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is different than, and in addition to, CCPA rights, and must be requested separately. We are only required to respond to one request per person each year. We are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mailing address (requests by phone, fax, chats, social media, etc.). We are not responsible for requests that are incomplete or not labeled and sent properly.
iii.    Affirmative Opt-In for Sale or Sharing, or use for Targeted Advertising, of PI of “Child” Residents of Certain States
We do not knowingly Sell or Share, or use for Targeted Advertising, the PI of Consumers who meet the definition of a “child” (or other similar term) under applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, unless we receive affirmative opt-in authorization from (i) the Consumer, if that person is at least 13 years of age and Consumer consent is required under the applicable law, or (ii) the parent or guardian of the Consumer, if the Consumer is less than 13 years of age. If you think we may have unknowingly Sold or Shared PI, or used PI for Targeted Advertising, of a Consumer under the threshold age (as set by the applicable U.S. State Privacy Law) without the appropriate affirmative opt-in authorization, please report that to us as described in the
Contact Us
section above.
