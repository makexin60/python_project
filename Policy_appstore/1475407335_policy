INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF
        PERSONAL INFORMATION
The use of our Services may involve the
        transfer, storage and processing of Personal Information within and outside of your country of residence,
        consistent with this Privacy Notice. The data protection laws of countries to which Personal Information may be
        transferred might not guarantee the same level of protection as your country does.
Transfer of Personal
        Information from within the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland and UK to outside of the EEA / UK /
        Switzerland
Your data is accessed by the
        controller, located in China. In addition, we use service providers in China and the US that they can help us
        provide you the Services.
When we transfer Personal
        Information from within the EEA, UK or Switzerland to outside the EEA, UK or Switzerland to China, we will
        transfer your personal data where necessary to provide the Services and perform the contract you entered into
        with us.
You may request additional details about how
        Personal Information is protected by us in case of transfer outside EEA, UK or Switzerland by contacting us as
        described in the “Contacting Us” section below.
SECURITY OF PERSONAL
        INFORMATION
We have adopted
        organizational, physical and technical security measures that are in line with the industry standards designed
        to protect the Personal Information you provide, and to prevent any unauthorized access, disclosure, use,
        modification, damage or loss of data.
Please
        understand, however, that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
        Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information you transmit to us and you
        understand that any Personal Information that you transfer to us is done at your own risk. If we learn of a
        security system breach, we will act in a timely fashion in accordance with any applicable law. We may attempt to
        notify you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our
        Services. We may post a notice on the Services if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at
        the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
        written notice of a data privacy or security breach.
DATA PROTECTION
        RIGHTS
Data protection laws in your jurisdiction
        may provide a number of legal rights in relation to the Personal Information that we hold about you and/or your
        child. Not all data protection laws are the same, so not all of these rights apply in all places. Also, some of
        these rights are subject to qualifications and limitations, and exercising these rights may impact the Services
        and products that we provide to you. However, we recognize that Personal Information belongs to you alone, and
        that enables you to control how we use it.
Your rights may include:
the right to request access to the Personal Information that
          we process about you, including the right to obtain information on and copy of such data;
in some circumstances, the right to receive P
ersonal Information
in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or
          request that we transmit those data to a third party where this is technically feasible. Please note that this
          right only applies to
Personal
          Information
which has been provided to us;
the right to request that we rectify Personal Information if
          it is inaccurate or incomplete;
the right to request that we erase Personal Information in
          certain circumstances. Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase Personal
          Information, but we are legally entitled to retain it;
the right to object to, and the right to request that we
          restrict, our processing of Personal Information in certain circumstances. Again, there may be circumstances
          where you object to, or ask us to restrict, our processing of Personal Information but we are legally entitled
          to continue processing Personal Information and / or to refuse that request; and
the right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory
          Authority.
Parents or guardians may exercise any rights
        that their child may have in relation to their Personal Information. For example, at any time, parents or
        guardians may review their child’s Personal Information, direct us to delete their child’s Personal Information,
        and may refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s Personal Information (in all cases, subject
        to the requirements and restrictions set out in applicable law). Parents and guardians may also agree to the
        collection and use of their child’s Personal Information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties unless
        it’s part of the requested service. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a
        termination of Services. In some jurisdictions, children may also exercise their data protection rights
        directly.
You can exercise your (and/or your child’s)
        rights by contacting us using the details set out in the “Contacting Us” section below. We may need to confirm
        your identity before completing your request, and, for example, may ask for you to confirm data points we
        already have about you. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable request to verify the
        requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We will respond all valid requests within a reasonable
        time in accordance with applicable laws. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable
        steps to help verify a parent’s identity before granting access to any Personal Information.
Your
        California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83
        permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal
        Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us
        using the contact information provided below and put “Shine the Light” in the subject line of your request.
In addition to the above mentioned
        rights, from January 1, 2020, you may be entitled to the below rights:
the
right to know
. California residents may request information about the
          categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about them, as well as the categories
          of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the sale
          or disclosure for business purposes of Personal Information to third parties, and the categories of third
          parties with whom this information was shared.
California residents may also request a copy of the Personal
          Information we have collected, and upon request, we will provide this information in electronic
          form
;
the
right to opt out of the sale
of Personal Information to third parties. We do not sell Personal
          Information at this time, and we do not sell the Personal Information of children under 16 years old;
the
right to request deletion
of Personal Information, subject to certain legal exceptions;
          and
the
right to not be discriminated
          against
for exercising any of the rights mentioned
          above.
California residents can exercise their
        rights by contacting us using the details set out in the “Contacting Us” section below.
Whenever feasible for verification, we will match the identifying
        information provided to the Personal Information already maintained by us. If, however, we cannot verify the
        requester’s identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request additional information.
California residents may also designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on their behalf. Such authorized agent must be registered with the California
        Secretary of State and must have permission to submit such requests. We may deny a request from an agent that
        does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on behalf of a California resident.
HOW WE
        RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
The “Do Not Track”
        (“DNT”) privacy preference is an option that may be made in some web browsers allowing you to opt-out of
        tracking by websites and online services. At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and
        not all browsers support DNT. We therefore do not recognize DNT signals and do not respond to them.
CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY
        NOTICE
We reserve the right to change or amend our
        Privacy Notice from time to time to address new issues of privacy and information security and to reflect
