Terms of Service
1. General Provisions
1.1
Mimo GmbH, Währinger Straße 2-4/48, 1090 Vienna, Austria (“Mimo,” “us,” or “we”) provides applications for Android and iOS (“Apps”), websites (“Websites”) and related services such as online communities via Discord or live sessions via Zoom (together with the Apps and Websites, the “Services”) that allow you to access and use various educational content and training services on computer science, data science, programming, software development and similar topics as well as tools for software development. Any use of the Services is subject to the following terms of service (“ToS”), in each case in the version valid at the time of conclusion of any contractual agreement between you and Mimo (“Contract”).
1.2
Mimo reserves the right to amend the ToS (“Amended ToS”) at any time and without giving reasons. Amended ToS must be announced by us at least 14 days before they come into force by sending the text of the Amended ToS to the email address you last provided. If you do not object to the changes within these 14 days in writing (e.g. by email to support@mimo.org), the changes shall be deemed accepted. If Amended ToS affect fees or the scope of Services to existing Contracts, these amendments are only permissible with your consent. In the event of a timely objection or, as applicable, if no consent is given, the Contract shall continue in accordance with the ToS valid at the time of conclusion of the contract; however, in such case, your Subscription will terminate at the end of the respective Subscription Period (no automatic renewal; see section 2.8), without this requiring a separate notification by Mimo.
2. Subject and Scope of Services, Subscription
2.1
Mimo is solely responsible for the provision and operation of the Services. Mimo assumes no liability that you will successfully complete tasks based on our Services or achieve a particular goal or learning outcome with our Services.
2.2
The scope of the Services may depend on your Subscription type. Mimo may publish additional Features. Features are independent of the scope of any Services and are provided by Mimo solely at its discretion in terms of accessibility, scope and availability. You cannot assert any claims for the future from accessing or using the Features. In particular, there is no entitlement to permanent access and unrestricted use. Mimo may deactivate, change or restrict features at any time and without notice.
2.3
Mimo offers automatically renewable subscriptions (“Subscription”) at different tiers for different periods (“Subscription Period”). Only Subscription enables you to access and use the Services. To enter into the Subscription
via the Websites, you are required to choose a Subscription Period on the Websites, provide your credit card or similar payment information, and confirm the Subscription, upon which you will receive a receipt via email;
via the Apps, you are required to choose a Subscription Period within the Apps and confirm your Subscription, upon which you will receive a receipt via email; this Subscription uses the in-app purchase functionality of third-party App Stores; the App Store on iOS and Google Play on Android (“App Stores”).
2.4
To subscribe, access and use the Services via the Website, the prerequisite is registration by creating an account. Registration is not obligatory when using the apps. However, you may use your email address along with a self-determined password or a single sign-on application provided by third parties such as Apple, Facebook, or Google (if provided by Mimo) to create an account. In this connection you
agree to provide accurate, complete, and current information about you as requested by Mimo;
are required to maintain the confidentiality of your password and other information related to the security of your account.
2.5
To create an account, you are required to be at least eighteen years of age. If you are at least fourteen years of age, you are allowed to create an account with the consent of your legal guardians. Mimo has the right to make its services subject to appropriate proof of identity and/or consent of your legal guardians.
2.6
The conclusion of a Subscription is subject to payment (“Payment Obligation”), due at the beginning of the Subscription. Concerning Subscriptions entered into
on the Websites, payment will be made using the credit card or similar payment information provided by you upon the conclusion of the Subscription;
within the Apps, payment will be made through the in-app purchase functionality provided by the App Stores.
2.7
A Subscription to our Services will automatically renew unless terminated at least twenty-four hours before the expiration of the Subscription Period. Mimo will inform you about the upcoming renewal at least 15 days in advance via email to the email address you last provided. Upon renewal, the Subscription Period will be extended by an additional equivalent Subscription Period. Your Payment Obligation will renew together with your Subscription.
2.8
Mimo may occasionally offer you access and use of an extended scope of the Services for trial purposes (“Trial”) for different periods (“Trial Periods”). Trials are Subscriptions free of charge that may, at our sole discretion, be determined, suspended, or discontinued at any time. To start the Trial, you may be required to provide your credit card information and confirm the Trial. Your Trial may convert into a subscription after the Trial Period. This and the Subscription Period will be part of the information provided in the trial offer. To prevent a Trial from converting into a Subscription with payment obligation, you may terminate the Trial within the Trial Period on the Websites or within the App Stores, depending on how you entered into the Trial.
3. Reservation of Rights
3.1
