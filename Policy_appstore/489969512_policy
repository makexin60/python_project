APAC
The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) is the primary data protection law in Japan that regulates the protection of personal information. It applies to business operators handling personal information of individuals in Japan. The APPI has been amended since it was originally enacted in 2003, with the most recent amendments coming into effect April 1, 2022.
Similarly to the distinction between “data controllers” and “data processors” under the GDPR, the APPI makes a distinction between “business operators”—or entities with the authority to control and make decisions about retained personal information (i.e., Asana’s customers) and third-party service providers handling personal information on behalf of a business operator (i.e., Asana).
The APPI also imposes restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information outside of Japan. Personal information may be transferred to overseas recipients if there are contractual agreements in place that ensure compliance with data protection standards in Japan.
Asana is committed to processing and safeguarding personal information as required by the APPI and its amendments. Asana’s
Data Processing Addendum
covers
Our data protection commitments to ensure that we comply with the APPI;
How we will assist our customers with their obligations under the APPI; and
The technical and organizational measures implemented to protect personal information.

U.S. (federal and state)
California
The CCPA (as amended by CPRA) is a law that provides California consumers certain rights with respect to their personal information. Specifically, the law requires that businesses subject to the statute grant consumers the ability to request access to and deletion of their data, and the ability to opt out of certain types of disclosures of their personal information. The law also restricts how service providers that process personal information on behalf of a business may use that information.
Where a business subject to the CCPA has entered into a service or subscription agreement with Asana, Asana will act as a service provider to that business. Specifically, Asana will process such customers’ personal information only for the purposes set forth in the applicable agreement and will cooperate with customers to fulfill their obligations with respect to deletion or access requests.
Asana's
Data Processing Addendum
specifically references our obligations under the CCPA. If your organization is a customer of Asana and requires an addendum, please reach out to

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. Service providers who are permitted by the financial institutions to access their consumers' nonpublic personal information (NPI) are also required to comply with GLBA. Asana is GLBA-ready and aligns our practices in accordance with GLBA's Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In addition to implementing security safeguards, we only use customer work content to provide our services, and not for any other purpose. Customers should not store sensitive personal data (including financial account numbers and social security numbers) in Asana.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that requires academic institutions like colleges and universities to protect the privacy of student educational records. Asana enables our customers to comply with FERPA by ensuring personal data is kept secure and only used to provide our services as described in our
Terms of Service
and
Privacy Statement
. Asana contractually commits to not disclosing customer data except as directed by the contracting academic institution, as allowed by our terms, or as required by law.

If you request these rights, we will need to verify your identity and may need to verify your relationship with Asana (for example, if you’re an administrator of an Asana organization, division, or workspace and you’re making a request on behalf of another individual) for security and to prevent fraud. You may be able to designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, the authorized agent must present signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also contact you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.
We may take additional steps to verify that you are authorized to make the request. If you are an end user of Asana’s services and not a direct customer of Asana (for example, your company uses Asana and you’re an employee or authorized representative of that company), you should direct requests relating to your information to the administrator of your company’s Asana account. We will redirect you to your administrator or notify the administrator directly. To exercise your privacy rights, please make a request by filling out this
form
.
Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances (for example, if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation). Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request. If we deny your request, we will provide you with information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable, in our communications with you.
