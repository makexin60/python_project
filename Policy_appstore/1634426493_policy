BROKEN RULES INTERACTIVE MEDIA GMBH’s PRIVACY AND DATA POLICY
Last update: 03 October 2022
GENERAL
1.1 We, Broken Rules Interactive Media GmbH (briefly “
BR
” or “
we
”/”
us
”), are a limited liability company having its corporate seat at Museumsplatz 1/1/2, 1070 Vienna, Austria, Europe. We are registered in the Vienna Commercial Court’s company register under company number FN 328777x. Our email address is
hello@brokenrul.es
.
1.2 We take your personal data very seriously and are vigilant with regard to its protection. With this Privacy and Data Policy (briefly “
Policy
”), we would therefore like to inform you of the purposes for which and how we collect and process your data (including your personal data), when you use our game “Old Man's Journey+” (briefly “
Game
”), which is available on Apple Arcade. Hence, this Policy applies and has effect in respect of this Game. Equally, we would like to inform you about any third parties who may receive your data any why.
1.3 The Game collects and processes data from individuals under the age of fourteen in the same way as for other users as described in this Policy for enabling us to fulfil our contractual obligations arising from you playing the Game (for details on that legal foundation, please see Article 6 (1) lit b GDPR) and to fulfil our legal and professional obligations (for details on that legal foundation, please see Article 6 (1) lit c GDPR; also see below item 2.1.2 in this respect). If you wish data of individuals under the age of fourteen to be deleted, please contact us at our contact information as set-out in item 1.1, above.
1.4 Should you have any questions or comments about this Policy, or should you wish to exercise your rights as a so-called “data subject” (for details on those rights, please see item 5., below), please contact us at our contact information as set-out in item 1.1, above.
1.5 We may make changes to this Policy from time to time in the future, which will be made available here. We encourage you to check here for any such changes from time to time, so you remain fully informed about BR’s data collection, processing and storing activities pertaining to the Game. Where appropriate, we may also notify you of such changes through the Game.
OUR DATA PROCESSING ACTIVITIES REGARDING THE GAME
2.1 Game Progress, Achievements and Savegames
2.1.1 The Game collects information about your progress in the Game, that is which level you have reached and thus also which level(s) you have already completed, which achievements (also known as trophies) you have already obtained in the Game, and the game also automatically or upon your request saves your progress in the game to savegames (alltogether briefly “
Game Progress
”).
If you do not provide Game Progress data, you may still play the Game, but you will not be able to save your progress and/or to obtain achievements in the Game.
2.1.2 The purpose of the collection of the Game Progress is to enable us to fulfil our contractual obligations arising from you playing the Game (for details on that legal foundation, please see Article 6 (1) lit b GDPR) and to fulfil our legal and professional obligations (for details on that legal foundation, please see Article 6 (1) lit c GDPR).
2.1.3 The Game Progress is stored on services provided by Apple, namely on Apple’s iCloud for savegames and on Apple’s Game Center for achievements. As we neither store your personal data nor any Game Progress data nor savegames on our servers, Apple’s privacy policies for iCloud and Game Center apply. You may decline to store data in Apple’s iCloud or to send data to Apple’s Game Center. To turn off Apple’s iCloud data storage, you must turn off iCloud in Apple Settings for our game. As a result, you will only be able to play in offline mode without any possible online multiplayer features and you will not be able to load your savegames on another device whilst you may still begin a new game on another device and save your game locally on your device(s). To stop sending data to Apple’s Game Center, you must sign out of Apple’s Game Center in Apple Settings. As a result, you will not be able to obtain any achievements in the game or get an entry in Apple’s Game Center leader boards.
2.1.4 To learn how Apple’s iCloud and Apple’s Game Center process your personal data, please see Apple’s iCloud’s and Apple’s Game Center’s privacy policies that you can access via the hyperlinks below:
Apple’s iCloud’s privacy policy is available here:

2.1.5 Except for the above Game Progress, the Game does not collect any further data from you and your device(s) on which you play the Game.
DATA SHARING
3.1 We generally do not share any of your personal data with third parties outside of BR. With regard to the service providers, which we use for handling email communication with you and for dispatching our newsletter to you in case you have actively subscribed to our newsletter, please see item 2.2.3, above.
3.2 With regard to your Game Progress data, which is stored on Apple’s iCloud for savegames and on Apple’s Game Center for achievements, please see items 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, above.
RETENTION PERIODS
4.1 We generally do not retain personal data for longer than it is necessary for the fulfilment of the respective purpose for which your personal data was collected. Unless otherwise required by law, we retain your personal data for a maximum of one-hundred-eighty days following the relevant matter having been addressed and/or following inactivity, whatever occurs earlier.
4.2 For the assertion or defence of legal claims as well as in light of § 1489 of the Austrian Civil Code, we, in particular cases, may store communications regarding bugs and/or other errors in the Game for up to thirty years after the relevant matter has been addressed.
YOUR RIGHTS AS A “DATA SUBJECT“
5.1 As a person concerned under data protection laws (briefly “
Data Subject
“), we would like to inform you of the following rights you generally have vis-à-vis BR as the so-called “controller”:
Right to Information
(for details, please see Article 15 GDPR): Every data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data (copy of the personal data which are the subject of the processing) and the following information: (a) the purposes of the processing; (b) the categories of personal data concerned; (c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; (d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing; (f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.

Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form;
Right to Rectification and Erasure
, for details, please see Article 16 GDPR: The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: (a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; (b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; (c) the data subject objects to the processing (see below); (d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed; (e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in the EU or member state law to which the controller is subject;(f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services (consent of a child).The right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation of the controller, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, and/or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right to Restriction of Processing
, for details, please see Article 18 GDPR: The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: (a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead; (c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (d) the data subject has objected to processing pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. Where processing has been restricted, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.
Right to Data Portability
, for details, please see Article 20 GDPR: Insofar as the processing is based on consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means, the data subject has the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.

, for details, please see Article 21 GDPR: The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party. The controller shall then no longer process the personal data, except where he prove compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. If the data subject objects to the processing for the purposes of direct marketing, the personal data shall no longer be processed for this purpose.
Right to File a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority
: Every data subject has the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority without prejudice to other administrative or judicial legal remedies, in particular in the EU Member State of their residence, their workplace or the place the alleged offense occurred, if the data subject is of the view that the processing of personal data concerning him or her breaches these legal provisions.

Game Center allows you to engage in game-related activities such as participation in leaderboards; multiplayer games; finding, viewing, and challenging friends; and tracking achievements.
When you play Game Center-enabled games while signed in to Game Center, Apple collects information such as the games you play and your game activity. This information is used to track your high scores, achievements, and challenges, and to improve Game Center for you and others.
Apple also collects a list of your Game Center friends, the players with whom you play, and when you play together. This information is used to help you reengage in multiplayer games easily, quickly see each other’s high scores, and to improve Game Center for you and others.
Your Game Center nickname, avatar, scores, and Arcade subscription state are visible to all Game Center users. You can also choose to share other Game Center activity information, such as games you have played and achievements progress, with your Game Center friends or all Game Center users. This information will be visible to those you share it with in Game Center and other Apple services, like the App Store and Apple Arcade. Your name may also be visible to your Game Center friends.
Apple uses non-identifiable information about your contacts who have linked their Game Center nickname with their contact card to suggest friends to you, but does not store this information. In addition, Game Center uses on-device processing to assist these recommendations.
Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better, and when we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Game Center, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.
Providing and Improving Game Center
Once you onboard to Game Center, you will be able to engage in game-related activities such as participation in leaderboards; multiplayer games; finding, viewing, and challenging friends; and tracking achievements. When you use Game Center, Apple collects information including the games you play, when you play them, and who you play with; your scores and achievements; and the challenges you send and receive. Apple also collects a list of your Game Center friends, the players with whom you play, and when you play together to help you reengage in multiplayer games easily and quickly see each other’s high scores. In addition, Apple collects information that is not associated with your Apple Account about your interaction with Game Center features, including features accessible from Settings such as your friend requests.
This information may be used to improve and optimize Game Center and other Apple services that use Game Center for you and others.
Playing with Other Players and Friends
Your Game Center nickname, avatar, scores, and Arcade subscription state are visible to all Game Center users for games with global leaderboards. You can also choose to share other Game Center activity information with your Game Center friends or all Game Center users. This information includes games you have played and your achievements progress, and will be visible to those you share it with in Game Center and other Apple services, like the App Store and Apple Arcade. Children’s Game Center activity information can be shared only with their Game Center friends. You can see and change your activity sharing state by going to Settings > Game Center > Activity Sharing on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, and System Settings > Game Center > Activity Sharing on Mac.
When your Game Center nickname is linked with your contact card, Game Center will use the email address and phone number associated with your Apple Account. This allows your Game Center friends to find you more easily based on the name they have for you in their Contacts app. You can control this setting on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Game Center > Help Friends Find You, and on Mac by going to System Settings > Game Center > Help Friends Find You.
When you play a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other Game Center users who are accessing the same game on the same Wi-Fi network or local area network, or are within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby and see your nickname and avatar. Where a developer is using Apple’s multiplayer functionality, you can disable this feature on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Game Center, then tapping to turn off Nearby Players. On Mac, go to System Settings > Game Center, then click to turn off Nearby Players. On tvOS, go to Settings > Users and Accounts > [user name] > Game Center, then turn off Nearby Players.
Apple receives non-identifiable information about your contacts who have chosen to link their Game Center nickname with their contact card. This information is used to enhance the friend recommendations shown to you on Game Center surfaces, but is not stored by Apple. In addition, Game Center uses on-device processing to assist these recommendations.
If you have friend relationships established before iOS 10, those friends have access to your real name. In any friend relationships established since you adopted iOS 10, only your nickname is visible to your friends. Children’s accounts never make real names visible to friends, including before iOS 10.
Communicating with You
Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Game Center and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. Apple may also use information about your activity within Game Center to send you emails and push notifications about new features, content, and offers available within Game Center. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to
account.apple.com
. To update your notification preferences on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Game Center. On Mac, go to System Settings > Notifications > Game Center. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services.
Third-Party Developers
When you are signed in to Game Center, the developers of the games you play can request information about you, including your nickname, avatar, and other unique Game Center identifiers. A developer can also request a list of related players, including your friends and the players you recently played with, which will include nicknames and avatars. If you choose to allow an app to connect you with friends, they can access a list of your friends who also play this game. Only friends who have also agreed to let this app connect with their friends will be visible to the app as your friend. You may also choose to not allow any apps to connect you with friends at any time. To do so on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Game Center and tap to turn off Share Friends List. On Mac, go to System Settings > Game Center, and click to turn off Share Friends List. This prevents apps from asking whether they can connect you with your Game Center friends and will stop sharing your friends list with previously allowed apps. Whenever you use a third-party app, you should review the developer’s terms, privacy policies, and practices to understand how they collect and use your data.
Children in Game Center
For children in your Family who use Game Center, you can use Content & Privacy Restrictions in Screen Time to limit time spent in specific apps and block Game Center features on your child’s device, including multiplayer functionality, the ability to add friends, and the ability to connect with friends playing the same game. To do this on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. On Mac, go to System Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy. On tvOS, go to Settings > General > Restrictions. Additionally, when communicating with other players in Game Center, children cannot send or receive user-inputted text. They are restricted to sending and receiving preset messages. In-game voice chat is disabled for children.
Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
We process your personal data in Game Center based on your consent and as necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. Where applicable local law provides, we process the following categories of personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests:
Your use of Game Center, including the games you play and your game activity
Your nickname, avatar, Arcade subscription state, scores, and other activity information
Your Game Center friends, the players with whom you play, and when you play together
These legitimate interests include:
Optimizing and improving Game Center and other Apple services that use Game Center for you and others
Sending you communications about Game Center and other related Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you
Preventing fraud and other malicious activity
Retention
Game Center retains the information collected about you as long as you maintain the Apple Account associated with your Game Center account.
Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity
We collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in Game Center and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, and other interactions with Game Center and other apps and services.
At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at
www.apple.com/privacy
.
