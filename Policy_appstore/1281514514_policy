Data protection provisions in accordance with the GDPR
We are delighted that you are interested in our company. Data protection is highly important to Hans Dinslage GmbH.
Personal data such as the name, address, or e-mail address of a data subject is always processed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in compliance with the national data protection provisions applicable for Hans Dinslage GmbH. The purpose of this Data Protection Declaration is for our company to inform the general public about the manner, scope, and purpose of the personal data that we collect, use, and process. In addition, this Data Protection Statement will explain the rights of data subjects.

However, online data transfers are by their nature associated with security vulnerabilities, meaning that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed.
