The iCollect Everything privacy policy:
When you sign up with us, we don’t know anything about you other than your e-mail address. We don’t collect names, addresses, IP information, country, and we don’t sell your data. All of your information is fully encrypted. By default your data is set to public to enable features such as buying/selling and sharing with friends and family. At this time there is no way to set it to private, but this may come in a future version of our products.
If you wish to delete your collection data at any time, open the app, log in, and go to the top left menu. From there, go to the Account section and you can delete your collection and account.
We do embed third-party libraries from Google Firebase (analytics), RevenueCat (in-app purchases), OneSignal (notifications), and Facebook (conversion tracking from ads). If you are concerned about any tracking from these third-party components, please contact those companies directly as we don’t make these libraries. Rest assured that none of these components see your collection data.
Any connection made to a social media account from within our apps, such as from Facebook or Twitter/X, is used only for the purpose of sharing your collection online within the platforms to your friends and families and users of those platforms. We do not store or use your social media credentials or platforms in any other way, and we don’t collection data from them. We also won’t post content on your behalf without your express permission at the time of the posting.
We do not receive our data from any third-party sources. Our database is user built and driven without the input of iCollect Everything employees unless a data issue is reported directly to us, similar to how Wikipedia works. If you notice data that is inappropriate or illegal for any reason, please contact us right away at support@icollecteverything.com so we have the opportunity to remove the information, suspend the account that uploaded the data, and provide any additional details to authorities as needed. We take violations extremely seriously, and we have zero tolerance for brutal violence, child pornography, rape, and other forms of illegal imagery and text.
