# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Thank you for using the **Local Sites Viewer App** ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we do and do not collect, and how your information is handled when you use our app.

## Data Collection and Use

The **Local Sites Viewer App** does **not collect any personal data**. The app functions purely for local network scanning to display websites that are accessible within your local network. It does not store or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or other private data.

### Local Network Scanning

The app detects your local IP address and scans active ports on your network. It does not collect, store, or share any information about the devices or websites discovered during the scanning process. Any data you enter for customizing the scan (such as IP range and ports) is used solely for the purpose of providing local site results in the app and is not retained after the session ends.

### Permissions

The app does not request or require any permissions that would allow access to personal information, contacts, camera, or other private data on your device. It only uses network-related permissions to scan your local network.

## Data Storage

No data is stored on our servers. All scanning and site discovery information is processed and displayed locally on your device. There is no server-side data storage, and no information is transmitted externally from your device.

## Third-Party Services

The **Local Sites Viewer App** does not integrate with any third-party services that collect or share personal data.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure that the app functions securely and that your data is protected. However, as the app does not collect or store data, there are no additional security measures necessary beyond those inherent to your deviceâ€™s local network environment.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be posted in this document with a revised "Last Updated" date.
